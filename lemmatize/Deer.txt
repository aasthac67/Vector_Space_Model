the common name deer ha the hoofed ruminant mammal forming the family cervidae the two main group of deer are the cervinae including the muntjac the elk wapiti the fallow deer and the chital and the capreolinae including the reindeer caribou the roe deer and the moose female reindeer and male deer of all specie except the chinese water deer grow and shed new antler each year in this they differ from permanently horned antelope which are part of a different family bovidae within the same order of ungulate artiodactyla the musk deer moschidae of asia and chevrotain tragulidae of tropical african and asian forest are separate family within the ruminant clade ruminantia they are not especially closely related to deer among the ruminantia deer appear in art from paleolithic cave painting onwards and they have played a role in mythology religion and literature throughout history a well a in heraldry their economic importance includes the use of their meat a venison their skin a soft strong buckskin and their antler a handle for knife deer hunting ha been a popular activity since at least the middle age and remains a resource for many family today distribution deer live in a variety of biome ranging from tundra to the tropical rainforest while often associated with forest many deer are ecotone specie that live in transitional area between forest and thicket for cover and prairie and savanna open space the majority of large deer specie inhabit temperate mixed deciduous forest mountain mixed coniferous forest tropical forest and savanna habitat around the world clearing open area within forest to some extent may actually benefit deer population by exposing the understory and allowing the type of grass weed and herb to grow that deer like to eat additionally access to adjacent croplands may also benefit deer however adequate forest or brush cover must still be provided for population to grow and thrive deer are widely distributed with indigenous representative in all continent except antarctica and australia though africa ha only one native deer the barbary stag a subspecies of red deer that is confined to the atlas mountain in the northwest of the continent an additional extinct specie of deer megaceroides algericus wa present in north africa until year ago fallow deer have been introduced to south africa small specie of brocket deer and pudus of central and south america and muntjac of asia generally occupy dense forest and are le often seen in open space with the possible exception of the indian muntjac there are also several specie of deer that are highly specialized and live almost exclusively in mountain grassland swamp and wet savanna or riparian corridor surrounded by desert some deer have a circumpolar distribution in both north america and eurasia example include the caribou that live in arctic tundra and taiga boreal forest and moose that inhabit taiga and adjacent area huemul deer taruca and chilean huemul of south america andes fill the ecological niche of the ibex and wild goat with the fawn behaving more like goat kid the highest concentration of large deer specie in temperate north america lie in the canadian rocky mountain and columbia mountain region between alberta and british columbia where all five north american deer specie deer mule deer caribou elk and moose can be found this region ha several cluster of national park including mount revelstoke national park glacier national park canada yoho national park and kootenay national park on the british columbia side and banff national park jasper national park and glacier national park u on the alberta and montana side mountain slope habitat vary from moist forested habitat to dry forest with alpine meadow higher up the foothill and river valley between the mountain range provide a mosaic of cropland and deciduous parkland the rare woodland caribou have the most restricted range living at higher altitude in the subalpine meadow and alpine tundra area of some of the mountain range elk and mule deer both migrate between the alpine meadow and lower coniferous forest and tend to be most common in this region elk also inhabit river valley bottomland which they share with deer the deer have recently expanded their range within the foothill and river valley bottom of the canadian rockies owing to conversion of land to cropland and the clearing of coniferous forest allowing more deciduous vegetation to grow up the mountain slope they also live in the aspen parkland north of calgary and edmonton where they share habitat with the moose the adjacent great plain grassland habitat are left to herd of elk american bison and pronghorn the eurasian continent including the indian subcontinent boast the most specie of deer in the world with most specie being found in asia europe in comparison ha lower diversity in plant and animal specie however many national park and protected reserve in europe do have population of red deer roe deer and fallow deer these specie have long been associated with the continent of europe but also inhabit asia minor the caucasus mountain and northwestern iran european fallow deer historically lived over much of europe during the ice age but afterwards became restricted primarily to the anatolian peninsula in turkey fallow deer population in europe are a result of historic introduction of this specie first to the mediterranean region of europe then eventually to the rest of europe they were initially park animal that later escaped and reestablished themselves in the wild historically europe deer specie shared their deciduous forest habitat with other herbivore such a the extinct tarpan forest horse extinct aurochs forest ox and the endangered wisent european bison good place to see deer in europe include the scottish highland the austrian alp the wetland between austria hungary and the czech republic and some fine national park including donana national park in spain the veluwe in the netherlands the ardennes in belgium and bialowieza national park of poland spain eastern europe and the caucasus mountain still have virgin forest area that are not only home to sizable deer population but also for other animal that were once abundant such a the wisent eurasian lynx iberian lynx wolf and brown bear the highest concentration of large deer specie in temperate asia occurs in the mixed deciduous forest mountain coniferous forest and taiga bordering north korea manchuria northeastern china and the ussuri region russia these are among some of the richest deciduous and coniferous forest in the world where one can find siberian roe deer sika deer elk and moose asian caribou occupy the northern fringe of this region along the border deer such a the sika deer thorold deer central asian red deer and elk have historically been farmed for their antler by han chinese turkic people tungusic people mongolian and korean like the sami people of finland and scandinavia the tungusic people mongolian and turkic people of southern siberia northern mongolia and the ussuri region have also taken to raising herd of asian caribou the highest concentration of large deer specie in the tropic occurs in southern asia in india plain region and nepal terai region these fertile plain consist of tropical seasonal moist deciduous dry deciduous forest and both dry and wet savanna that are home to chital hog deer barasingha indian sambar and indian muntjac grazing specie such a the endangered barasingha and very common chital are gregarious and live in large herd indian sambar can be gregarious but are usually solitary or live in smaller herd hog deer are solitary and have lower density than indian muntjac deer can be seen in several national park in india nepal and sri lanka of which kanha national park dudhwa national park and chitwan national park are most famous sri lanka wilpattu national park and yala national park have large herd of indian sambar and chital the indian sambar are more gregarious in sri lanka than other part of their range and tend to form larger herd than elsewhere the chao praya river valley of thailand wa once primarily tropical seasonal moist deciduous forest and wet savanna that hosted population of hog deer the schomburgk deer eld deer indian sambar and indian muntjac both the hog deer and eld deer are rare whereas indian sambar and indian muntjac thrive in protected national park such a khao yai many of these south asian and southeast asian deer specie also share their habitat with other herbivore such a asian elephant the various asian rhinoceros specie various antelope specie such a nilgai antelope blackbuck and indian gazelle in india and wild ox such a wild asian water buffalo gaur banteng and kouprey one way that different herbivore can survive together in a given area is for each specie to have different food preference although there may be some overlap australia ha six introduced specie of deer that have established sustainable wild population from acclimatisation society release in the century these are the fallow deer red deer sambar hog deer rusa and chital red deer introduced into new zealand in from english and scottish stock were domesticated in deer farm by the late and are common farm animal there now seven other specie of deer were introduced into new zealand but none are a widespread a red deer description deer constitute the second most diverse family of artiodactyla after bovid though of a similar build deer are strongly distinguished from antelope by their antler which are temporary and regularly regrown unlike the permanent horn of bovid characteristic typical of deer include long powerful leg a diminutive tail and long ear deer exhibit a broad variation in physical proportion the largest extant deer is the moose which is nearly metre ft tall and weighs up to kilogram lb the elk stand metre ft at the shoulder and weighs kilogram lb the northern pudu is the smallest deer in the world it reach merely centimetre in at the shoulder and weighs kilogram lb the southern pudu is only slightly taller and heavier sexual dimorphism is quite pronounced in most specie male tend to be larger than female and except for the reindeer only male posse antlerscoat colour generally varies between red and brown though it can be a dark a chocolate brown in the tufted deer or have a grayish tinge a in elk different specie of brocket deer vary from gray to reddish brown in coat colour several specie such a the chital the fallow deer and the sika deer feature white spot on a brown coat coat of reindeer show notable geographical variation deer undergo two moult in a year for instance in red deer the red summer coat is gradually replaced by the dense greyish brown winter coat in autumn which in turn give way to the summer coat in the following spring moulting is affected by the photoperioddeer are also excellent jumper and swimmer deer are ruminant or and have a stomach some deer such a those on the island of rum do consume meat when it is available nearly all deer have a facial gland in front of each eye the gland contains a strongly scented pheromone used to mark it home range buck of a wide range of specie open these gland wide when angry or excited all deer have a liver without a gallbladder deer also have a tapetum lucidum which give them sufficiently good night vision antler all male deer posse antler with the exception of the water deer in which male have long canine that reach below the lower jaw female generally lack antler though female reindeer bear antler smaller and le branched than those of the male occasionally female in other specie may develop antler especially in telemetacarpal deer such a european roe deer red deer deer and mule deer and le often in plesiometacarpal deer a study of antlered female deer noted that antler tend to be small and malformed and are shed frequently around the time of parturitionthe fallow deer and the various subspecies of the reindeer have the largest a well a the heaviest antler both in absolute term a well a in proportion to body mass an average of gram oz per kilogram of body mass the tufted deer on the other hand ha the smallest antler of all deer while the pudu ha the lightest antler with respect to body mass gram oz per kilogram of body mass the structure of antler show considerable variation while fallow deer and elk antler are palmate with a broad central portion deer antler include a series of tine sprouting upward from a main beam and those of the pudu are mere spike antler development begin from the pedicel a bony structure that appears on the top of the skull by the time the animal is a year old the pedicel give rise to a spiky antler the following year that is replaced by a branched antler in the third year this process of losing a set of antler to develop a larger and more branched set continues for the rest of the life the antler emerge a soft tissue known a velvet antler and progressively harden into bony structure known a hard antler following mineralisation and blockage of blood vessel in the tissue from the tip to the baseantlers might be one of the most exaggerated male secondary sexual characteristic and are intended primarily for reproductive success through sexual selection and for combat the tine fork on the antler create groove that allow another male antler to lock into place this allows the male to wrestle without risking injury to the face antler are correlated to an individual position in the social hierarchy and it behaviour for instance the heavier the antler the higher the individual status in the social hierarchy and the greater the delay in shedding the antler male with larger antler tend to be more aggressive and dominant over others antler can be an honest signal of genetic quality male with larger antler relative to body size tend to have increased resistance to pathogen and higher reproductive capacityin elk in yellowstone national park antler also provide protection against predation by wolf teeth most deer bear teeth the corresponding dental formula is the elk and the reindeer may be exception a they may retain their upper canine and thus have teeth dental formula the chinese water deer tufted deer and muntjac have enlarged upper canine teeth forming sharp tusk while other specie often lack upper canine altogether the cheek teeth of deer have crescent ridge of enamel which enable them to grind a wide variety of vegetation the teeth of deer are adapted to feeding on vegetation and like other ruminant they lack upper incisor instead having a tough pad at the front of their upper jaw biology diet deer are browser and feed primarily on foliage of grass sedge forbs shrub and tree with additional consumption of lichen in northern latitude during winter they have small unspecialized stomach by ruminant standard and high nutrition requirement rather than eating and digesting vast quantity of fibrous food a for example sheep and cattle do deer select easily digestible shoot young leaf fresh grass soft twig fruit fungi and lichen the food after minimal fermentation and shredding pass rapidly through the alimentary canal the deer require a large amount of mineral such a calcium and phosphate in order to support antler growth and this further necessitates a diet there are however some report of deer engaging in carnivorous activity such a eating dead alewife along lakeshore or depredating the nest of northern bobwhite reproduction nearly all cervid are uniparental specie the fawn are only cared for by the mother known a a doe a doe generally ha one or two fawn at a time triplet while not unknown are uncommon mating season typically begin in later august and last until december some specie mate until early march the gestation period is anywhere up to ten month for the european roe deer most fawn are born with their fur covered with white spot though in many specie they lose these spot by the end of their first winter in the first twenty minute of a fawn life the fawn begin to take it first step it mother lick it clean until it is almost free of scent so predator will not find it it mother leaf often to graze and the fawn doe not like to be left behind sometimes it mother must gently push it down with her foot the fawn stay hidden in the grass for one week until it is strong enough to walk with it mother the fawn and it mother stay together for about one year a male usually leaf and never see his mother again but female sometimes come back with their own fawn and form small herd disease in some area of the uk deer especially fallow deer due to their gregarious behaviour have been implicated a a possible reservoir for transmission of bovine tuberculosis a disease which in the uk in cost million in attempt to eradicate in new zealand deer are thought to be important a vector picking up m bovis in area where brushtail possum trichosurus vulpecula are infected and transferring it to previously uninfected possum when their carcass are scavenged elsewhere the deer odocoileus virginianus ha been confirmed a the sole maintenance host in the michigan outbreak of bovine tuberculosis which remains a significant barrier to the u nationwide eradication of the disease in livestockmoose and deer can carry rabiesdocile moose may suffer from brain worm a helminth which drill hole through the brain in it search for a suitable place to lay it egg a government biologist state that they move around looking for the right spot and never really find it deer appear to be immune to this parasite it pass through the digestive system and is excreted in the feces the parasite is not screened by the moose intestine and pass into the brain where damage is done that is externally apparent both in behaviour and in gaitdeer elk and moose in north america may suffer from chronic wasting disease which wa identified at a colorado laboratory in the and is believed to be a prion disease out of an abundance of caution hunter are advised to avoid contact with specified risk material srm such a the brain spinal column or lymph node deboning the meat when butchering and sanitizing the knife and other tool used to butcher are amongst other government recommendation evolution deer are believed to have evolved from antlerless tusked ancestor that resembled modern duikers and diminutive deer in the early eocene and gradually developed into the first antlered cervoids the superfamily of cervid and related extinct family in the miocene eventually with the development of antler the tusk a well a the upper incisor disappeared thus evolution of deer took nearly million year biologist valerius geist suggests evolution to have occurred in stage there are not many prominent fossil to trace this evolution but only fragment of skeleton and antler that might be easily confused with false antler of specie eocene epoch the ruminant ancestor of the cervidae are believed to have evolved from diacodexis the earliest known artiodactyl ungulate mya in the eocene diacodexis nearly the size of a rabbit featured the talus bone characteristic of all modern ungulate this ancestor and it relative occurred throughout north america and eurasia but were on the decline by at least mya analysis of a nearly complete skeleton of diacodexis discovered in gave rise to speculation that this ancestor could be closer to the than the ruminant andromeryx is another prominent prehistoric ruminant but appears to be closer to the tragulids oligocene epoch the formation of the himalaya and the alp brought about significant geographic change this wa the chief reason behind the extensive diversification of form and the emergence of cervid from the oligocene to the early pliocene the latter half of the oligocene mya saw the appearance of the european eumeryx and the north american leptomeryx the latter resembled bovid and cervid in dental morphology for instance it had brachyodont molar while the former wa more advanced other form included the north american blastomeryx and the european dremotherium these animal are believed to have been the direct ancestor of all modern antlered deer though they themselves lacked antler another contemporaneous form wa the protoceratid protoceras that wa replaced by syndyoceras in the miocene these animal were unique in having a horn on the nose late eocene fossil dated approximately million year ago which were found in north america show that syndyoceras had bony skull outgrowth that resembled antler miocene epoch fossil evidence suggests that the earliest member of the superfamily cervoidea appeared in eurasia in the miocene dicrocerus euprox and heteroprox were probably the first antlered cervid dicrocerus featured antler that were shed regularly stephanocemas had more developed and diffuse crowned antler procervulus palaeomerycidae in addition to the tusk of dremotherium possessed antler that were not shed contemporary form such a the merycodontines eventually gave rise to the modern pronghornthe cervinae emerged a the first group of extant cervid around mya during the late miocene in central asia the tribe muntiacini made it appearance a muntiacus leilaoensis around mya the early muntjac varied in small a hare or a large a fallow deer they had tusk for fighting and antler for defence capreolinae followed soon after alceini appeared mya around this period the tethys ocean disappeared to give way to vast stretch of grassland these provided the deer with abundant vegetation that led to the development of ornamental antler and allowed population to flourish and colonise area a antler had become pronounced the canine were no more retained or were poorly represented a in elk probably because diet wa no more and antler were better display organ in muntjac and tufted deer the antler a well a the canine are small the tragulids however posse long canine to this day pliocene epoch with the onset of the pliocene the global climate became cooler a fall in the led to massive glaciation consequently grassland abounded in nutritious forage thus a new spurt in deer population ensued the oldest member of cervini cervocerus novorossiae appeared around the transition from miocene to pliocene mya in eurasia cervine fossil from early pliocene to a late a the pleistocene have been excavated in china and the himalaya while cervus and dama appeared nearly mya axis emerged during the late the tribe capreolini and rangiferini appeared around myaaround mya the rangiferines bretzia and eocoileus were the first cervid to reach north america this implies the bering strait could be crossed during the late this appears highly probable a the camelids migrated into asia from north america around the same time deer invaded south america in the late pliocene mya a part of the great american interchange thanks to the recently formed isthmus of panama and emerged successful due to the small number of competing ruminant in the continent pleistocene epoch large deer with impressive antler evolved during the early pleistocene probably a a result of abundant resource to drive evolution the early pleistocene cervid eucladoceros wa comparable in size to the modern elk megaloceros featured the irish elk m giganteus one of the largest known cervid the irish elk reached metre ft at the shoulder and had heavy antler that spanned metre ft from tip to tip these large animal are thought to have faced extinction due to conflict between sexual selection for large antler and body and natural selection for a smaller form meanwhile the moose and reindeer radiated into north america from siberia taxonomy and classification deer constitute the artiodactyl family cervidae this family wa first described by german zoologist georg august goldfuss in handbuch der zoologie three subfamily are recognised capreolinae first described by the english zoologist joshua brooke in cervinae described by goldfuss and hydropotinae first described by french zoologist edouard louis trouessart in other attempt at the classification of deer have been based on morphological and genetic difference the naturalist victor brooke suggested in that deer could be bifurcated into two class on the according to the feature of the second and fifth metacarpal bone of their forelimb plesiometacarpalia most old world deer and telemetacarpalia most new world deer he treated the musk deer a a cervid placing it under telemetacarpalia while the telemetacarpal deer showed only those element located far from the joint the plesiometacarpal deer retained the element closer to the joint a well differentiation on the basis of diploid number of chromosome in the late century ha been flawed by several inconsistenciesin the zoologist colin grove and peter grubb identified three subfamily cervinae hydropotinae and odocoileinae they noted that the hydropotines lack antler and the other two subfamily differ in their skeletal morphology however they reverted from this classification in external relationship until the beginning of the century it wa understood that the family moschidae musk deer is sister to cervidae however a phylogenetic study by alexandre hassanin of national museum of natural history france and colleague based on mitochondrial and nuclear analysis revealed that moschidae and bovidae form a clade sister to cervidae according to the study cervidae diverged from the clade to million year ago the following cladogram is based on the study internal relationship a phylogenetic study of the internal relationship in cervidae by clement gilbert and colleague divided the family into two major clade capreolinae telemetacarpal or new world deer and cervinae plesiometacarpal or old world deer study in the late century suggested a similar bifurcation in the family this a well a previous study support monophyly in cervinae while capreolinae appears paraphyletic the study identified two lineage in cervinae cervini comprising the genus axis cervus dama and rucervus and muntiacini muntiacus and elaphodus capreolinae featured three lineage alceini alces specie capreolini capreolus and the subfamily hydropotinae and rangiferini blastocerus hippocamelus mazama odocoileus pudu and rangifer specie the following cladogram is based on the study extant subfamily genus and specie the subfamily capreolinae consists of genus and specie while cervinae comprises genus and specie hydropotinae

of stag in history deer had a central role in the ancient art culture and mythology of the hittite the ancient egyptian the celt the ancient greek the asian and several others for instance the stag

borne by a famous hero of irish grandson of fionn mac cumhail the name wa popularised in the century by james macpherson creator of poetry in literature deer have been an integral part of fable and other literary work since the inception of writing stag were used a symbol in the latter sumerian writing for instance the boat of sumerian god enki is named the stag of azbu there are several mention of the animal in the rigveda a well a the bible in the indian epic ramayana sita is lured by a golden deer which rama try to catch in the absence of both rama and lakshman ravana kidnaps sita many of the allegorical aesop fable such a the stag at the pool the doe and the stag and a lion personify deer to give moral lesson for instance the sick stag give the message that uncaring friend can do more harm than good the yaqui deer song accompanies the deer dance which is performed by a pascola from the spanish easter dancer also known a a deer dancer pascolas would perform at religious and social
