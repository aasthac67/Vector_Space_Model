ant are eusocial insect of the family formicidae and along with the related wasp and bee belong to the order hymenoptera ant appear in the fossil record across the globe in considerable diversity during the latest early cretaceous and early late cretaceous suggesting an earlier origin ant evolved from vespoid wasp ancestor in the cretaceous period and diversified after the rise of flowering plant more than of an estimated total of specie have been classified they are easily identified by their elbowed antenna and the distinctive structure that form their slender waist ant form colony that range in size from a few dozen predatory individual living in small natural cavity to highly organised colony that may occupy large territory and consist of million of individual larger colony consist of various caste of sterile wingless female most of which are worker ergates a well a soldier dinergates and other specialised group nearly all ant colony also have some fertile male called drone aner and one or more fertile female called queen gynes the colony are described a superorganisms because the ant appear to operate a a unified entity collectively working together to support the colony ant have colonised almost every landmass on earth the only place lacking indigenous ant are antarctica and a few remote or inhospitable island ant thrive in most ecosystem and may form of the terrestrial animal biomass their success in so many environment ha been attributed to their social organisation and their ability to modify habitat tap resource and defend themselves their long with other specie ha led to mimetic commensal parasitic and mutualistic relationship ant society have division of labour communication between individual and an ability to solve complex problem these parallel with human society have long been an inspiration and subject of study many human culture make use of ant in cuisine medication and ritual some specie are valued in their role a biological pest control agent their ability to exploit resource may bring ant into conflict with human however a they can damage crop and invade building some specie such a the red imported fire ant solenopsis invicta are regarded a invasive specie establishing themselves in area where they have been introduced accidentally etymology the word ant and it chiefly dialectal form emmet come from ante emete of middle english which come from aemette of old english and these are all related to the dialectal dutch emt and the old high german ameiza from which come the modern german ameise all of these word come from west germanic aemaitjon and the original meaning of the word wa the biter from off away cut the family name formicidae is derived from the latin formica ant from which the word in other romance language such a the portuguese formiga italian formica spanish hormiga romanian furnica and french fourmi are derived it ha been hypothesised that a word wa used cf sanskrit vamrah greek murmex myrmex old church slavonic mraviji old irish moirb old norse maurr dutch mier swedish myra danish myre middle dutch miere crimean gothic miera taxonomy and evolution the family formicidae belongs to the order hymenoptera which also includes sawfly bee and wasp ant evolved from a lineage within the stinging wasp and a study suggests that they are a sister group of the apoidea in e o wilson and his colleague identified the fossil remains of an ant sphecomyrma that lived in the cretaceous period the specimen trapped in amber dating back to around million year ago ha feature found in some wasp but not found in modern ant sphecomyrma wa possibly a ground forager while haidomyrmex and haidomyrmodes related genus in subfamily sphecomyrminae are reconstructed a active arboreal predator older ant in the genus sphecomyrmodes have been found in million amber from myanmar a study suggested that ant arose ten of million of year earlier than previously thought up to million year ago after the rise of flowering plant about million year ago they diversified and assumed ecological dominance around million year ago some group such a the leptanillinae and martialinae are suggested to have diversified from early primitive ant that were likely to have been predator underneath the surface of the soil during the cretaceous period a few specie of primitive ant ranged widely on the laurasian supercontinent the northern hemisphere they were scarce in comparison to the population of other insect representing only about of the entire insect population ant became dominant after adaptive radiation at the beginning of the paleogene period by the oligocene and miocene ant had come to represent of all insect found in major fossil deposit of the specie that lived in the eocene epoch around one in genus survive to the present genus surviving today comprise of the genus in baltic amber fossil early oligocene and of the genus in dominican amber fossil apparently early miocene termite live in colony and are sometimes called white ant but termite are not ant they are the isoptera and together with cockroach they form the order blattodea blattodeans are related to mantid cricket and other winged insect that do not undergo full metamorphosis like ant termite are eusocial with sterile worker but they differ greatly in the genetics of reproduction the similarity of their social structure to that of ant is attributed to convergent evolution velvet ant look like large ant but are wingless female wasp distribution and diversity ant are found on all continent except antarctica and only a few large island such a greenland iceland part of polynesia and the hawaiian island lack native ant specie ant occupy a wide range of ecological niche and exploit many different food resource a direct or indirect herbivore predator and scavenger most ant specie are omnivorous generalist but a few are specialist feeder their ecological dominance is demonstrated by their biomass ant are estimated to contribute on average and nearly in the tropic of terrestrial animal biomass exceeding that of the vertebratesants range in size from to millimetre in the largest specie being the fossil titanomyrma giganteum the queen of which wa centimetre in long with a wingspan of centimetre in ant vary in colour most ant are red or black but a few specie are green and some tropical specie have a metallic lustre more than specie are currently known with upper estimate of the potential existence of about see the article list of ant genus with the greatest diversity in the tropic taxonomic study continue to resolve the classification and systematics of ant online database of ant specie including antbase and the hymenoptera name server help to keep track of the known and newly described specie the relative ease with which ant may be sampled and studied in ecosystem ha made them useful a indicator specie in biodiversity study morphology ant are distinct in their morphology from other insect in having elbowed antenna metapleural gland and a strong constriction of their second abdominal segment into a petiole the head mesosoma and metasoma are the three distinct body segment formally tagmata the petiole form a narrow waist between their mesosoma thorax plus the first abdominal segment which is fused to it and gaster abdomen le the abdominal segment in the petiole the petiole may be formed by one or two node the second alone or the second and third abdominal segment like other insect ant have an exoskeleton an external covering that provides a protective casing around the body and a point of attachment for muscle in contrast to the internal skeleton of human and other vertebrate insect do not have lung oxygen and other gas such a carbon dioxide pas through their exoskeleton via tiny valve called spiracle insect also lack closed blood vessel instead they have a long thin perforated tube along the top of the body called the dorsal aorta that function like a heart and pump haemolymph toward the head thus driving the circulation of the internal fluid the nervous system consists of a ventral nerve cord that run the length of the body with several ganglion and branch along the way reaching into the extremity of the appendage head an ant head contains many sensory organ like most insect ant have compound eye made from numerous tiny lens attached together ant eye are good for acute movement detection but do not offer a high resolution image they also have three small ocellus simple eye on the top of the head that detect light level and polarization compared to vertebrate ant tend to have blurrier eyesight particularly in smaller specie and a few subterranean taxon are completely blind however some ant such a australia bulldog ant have excellent vision and are capable of discriminating the distance and size of object moving nearly a metre awaytwo antenna feeler are attached to the head these organ detect chemical air current and vibration they also are used to transmit and receive signal through touch the head ha two strong jaw the mandible used to carry food manipulate object construct nest and for defence in some specie a small pocket infrabuccal chamber inside the mouth store food so it may be passed to other ant or their larva mesosoma both the leg and wing of the ant are attached to the mesosoma thorax the leg terminate in a hooked claw which allows them to hook on and climb surface only reproductive ant queen and male have wing queen shed their wing after the nuptial flight leaving visible stub a distinguishing feature of queen in a few specie wingless queen ergatoids and male occur metasoma the metasoma the abdomen of the ant house important internal organ including those of the reproductive respiratory trachea and excretory system worker of many specie have their structure modified into sting that are used for subduing prey and defending their nest polymorphism in the colony of a few ant specie there are physical in distinct called minor median and major ergates often the larger ant have disproportionately larger head and correspondingly stronger mandible these are known a macrergates while smaller worker are known a micrergates although formally known a dinergates such individual are sometimes called soldier ant because their stronger mandible make them more effective in fighting although they still are worker and their duty typically do not vary greatly from the minor or median worker in a few specie the median worker are absent creating a sharp divide between the minor and major weaver ant for example have a distinct bimodal size distribution some other specie show continuous variation in the size of worker the smallest and largest worker in pheidologeton diversus show nearly a difference in their can not mate however because of the haplodiploid system in ant worker of a number of specie can lay unfertilised egg that become fully fertile haploid male the role of worker may change with their age and in some specie such a honeypot ant young worker are fed until their gasters are distended and act a living food storage vessel these food storage worker are called repletes for instance these replete worker develop in the north american honeypot ant myrmecocystus mexicanus usually the largest worker in the colony develop into repletes and if repletes are removed from the colony other worker become repletes demonstrating the flexibility of this particular polymorphism this polymorphism in morphology and behaviour of worker initially wa thought to be determined by environmental factor such a nutrition and hormone that led to different developmental path however genetic difference between worker caste have been noted in acromyrmex sp these polymorphism are caused by relatively small genetic change difference in a single gene of solenopsis invicta can decide whether the colony will have single or multiple queen the australian jack jumper ant myrmecia pilosula ha only a single pair of chromosome with the male having just one chromosome a they are haploid the lowest number known for any animal making it an interesting subject for study in the genetics and developmental biology of social insect life cycle the life of an ant start from an egg if the egg is fertilised the progeny will be female diploid if not it will be male haploid ant develop by complete metamorphosis with the larva stage passing through a pupal stage before emerging a an adult the larva is largely immobile and is fed and cared for by worker food is given to the larva by trophallaxis a process in which an ant regurgitates liquid food held in it crop this is also how adult share food stored in the social stomach larva especially in the later stage may also be provided solid food such a trophic egg piece of prey and seed brought by workersthe larva grow through a series of four or five moult and enter the pupal stage the pupa ha the appendage free and not fused to the body a in a butterfly pupa the differentiation into queen and worker which are both female and different caste of worker is influenced in some specie by the nutrition the larva obtain genetic influence and the control of gene expression by the developmental environment are complex and the determination of caste continues to be a subject of research winged male ant called drone emerge from pupa along with the usually winged breeding female some specie such a army ant have wingless queen larva and pupa need to be kept at fairly constant temperature to ensure proper development and so often are moved around among the various brood chamber within the colonya new ergate spends the first few day of it adult life caring for the queen and young she then graduate to digging and other nest work and later to defending the nest and foraging these change are sometimes fairly sudden and define what are called temporal caste an explanation for the sequence is suggested by the high casualty involved in foraging making it an acceptable risk only for ant who are older and are likely to die soon of natural causesant colony can be the queen can live for up to year and worker live from to year male however are more transitory being quite and surviving for only a few week ant queen are estimated to live time a long a solitary insect of a similar sizeants are active all year long in the tropic but in cooler region they survive the winter in a state of dormancy known a hibernation the form of inactivity are varied and some temperate specie have larva going into the inactive state diapause while in others the adult alone pas the winter in a state of reduced activity reproduction a wide range of reproductive strategy have been noted in ant specie female of many specie are known to be capable of reproducing asexually through thelytokous parthenogenesis secretion from the male accessory gland in some specie can plug the female genital opening and prevent female from most ant specie have a system in which only the queen and breeding female have the ability to mate contrary to popular belief some ant nest have multiple queen while others may exist without queen worker with the ability to reproduce are called gamergates and colony that lack queen are then called gamergate colony colony with queen are said to be can also mate with existing queen by entering a foreign colony when the drone is initially attacked by the worker it release a mating pheromone if recognized a a mate it will be carried to the queen to mate male may also patrol the nest and fight others by grabbing them with their mandible piercing their exoskeleton and then marking them with a pheromone the marked male is interpreted a an invader by worker ant and is killed most ant are univoltine producing a new generation each year during the breeding period winged female and winged male known to entomologist a alates leave the colony in what is called a nuptial flight the nuptial flight usually take place in the late spring or early summer when the weather is hot and humid heat make flying easier and freshly fallen rain make the ground softer for mated queen to dig nest male typically take flight before the female male then use visual cue to find a common mating ground for example a landmark such a a pine tree to which other male in the area converge male secrete a mating pheromone that female follow male will mount female in the air but the actual mating process usually take place on the ground female of some specie mate with just one male but in others they may mate with a many a ten or more different male storing the sperm in their spermathecaemated female then seek a suitable place to begin a colony there they break off their wing and begin to lay and care for egg the female can selectively fertilise future egg with the sperm stored to produce diploid worker or lay unfertilized haploid egg to produce drone the first worker to hatch are known a nanitics and are weaker and smaller than later worker but they begin to serve the colony immediately they enlarge the nest forage for food and care for the other egg specie that have multiple queen may have a queen leaving the nest along with some worker to found a colony at a new site a process akin to swarming in honeybee behaviour and ecology communication ant communicate with each other using pheromone sound and touch the use of pheromone a chemical signal is more developed in ant such a the red harvester ant than in other hymenopteran group like other insect ant perceive smell with their long thin and mobile antenna the paired antenna provide information about the direction and intensity of scent since most ant live on the ground they use the soil surface to leave pheromone trail that may be followed by other ant in specie that forage in group a forager that find food mark a trail on the way back to the colony this trail is followed by other ant these ant then reinforce the trail when they head back with food to the colony when the food source is exhausted no new trail are marked by returning ant and the scent slowly dissipates this behaviour help ant deal with change in their environment for instance when an established path to a food source is blocked by an obstacle the forager leave the path to explore new route if an ant is successful it leaf a new trail marking the shortest route on it return successful trail are followed by more ant reinforcing better route and gradually identifying the best pathants use pheromone for more than just making trail a crushed ant emits an alarm pheromone that sends nearby ant into an attack frenzy and attracts more ant from farther away several ant specie even use propaganda pheromone to confuse enemy ant and make them fight among themselves pheromone are produced by a wide range of structure including dufour gland poison gland and gland on the hindgut pygidium rectum sternum and hind tibia pheromone also are exchanged mixed with food and passed by trophallaxis transferring information within the colony this allows other ant to detect what task group eg foraging or nest maintenance other colony member belong to in ant specie with queen caste when the dominant queen stop producing a specific pheromone worker begin to raise new queen in the colonysome ant produce sound by stridulation using the gaster segment and their mandible sound may be used to communicate with colony member or with other specie defence ant attack and defend themselves by biting and in many specie by stinging often injecting or spraying chemical such a formic acid in the case of formicine ant alkaloid and piperidines in fire ant and a variety of protein component in other ant bullet ant paraponera located in central and south america are considered to have the most painful sting of any insect although it is usually not fatal to human this sting is given the highest rating on the schmidt sting pain indexthe sting of jack jumper ant can be fatal and an antivenom ha been developed for itfire ant solenopsis spp are unique in having a venom sac containing piperidine alkaloid their sting are painful and can be dangerous to hypersensitive people ant of the genus odontomachus are equipped with mandible called which snap shut faster than any other predatory appendage within the animal kingdom one study of odontomachus bauri recorded peak speed of between and and mph with the jaw closing within microsecond on average the ant were also observed to use their jaw a a catapult to eject intruder or fling themselves backward to escape a threat before striking the ant open it mandible extremely widely and lock them in this position by an internal mechanism energy is stored in a thick band of muscle and explosively released when triggered by the stimulation of sensory organ resembling hair on the inside of the mandible the mandible also permit slow and fine movement for other task also are seen in the following genus anochetus orectognathus and strumigenys plus some member of the dacetini tribe which are viewed a example of convergent evolution a malaysian specie of ant in the camponotus cylindricus group ha enlarged mandibular gland that extend into their gaster if combat take a turn for the worse a worker may perform a final act of suicidal altruism by rupturing the membrane of it gaster causing the content of it mandibular gland to burst from the anterior region of it head spraying a poisonous corrosive secretion containing acetophenones and other chemical that immobilise small insect attacker the worker subsequently diessuicidal defence by worker are also noted in a brazilian ant forelius pusillus where a small group of ant leaf the security of the nest after sealing the entrance from the outside each evening in addition to defence against predator ant need to protect their colony from pathogen some worker ant maintain the hygiene of the colony and their activity include undertaking or necrophory the disposal of dead oleic acid ha been identified a the compound released from dead ant that trigger necrophoric behaviour in atta mexicana while worker of linepithema humile react to the absence of characteristic chemical dolichodial and iridomyrmecin present on the cuticle of their living nestmates to trigger similar behaviournests may be protected from physical threat such a flooding and overheating by elaborate nest architecture worker of cataulacus muticus an arboreal specie that life in plant hollow respond to flooding by drinking water inside the nest and excreting it outside camponotus anderseni which nest in the cavity of wood in mangrove habitat deal with submergence under water by switching to anaerobic respiration learning many animal can learn behaviour by imitation but ant may be the only group apart from mammal where interactive teaching ha been observed a knowledgeable forager of temnothorax albipennis can lead a naive to newly discovered food by the process of tandem running the follower obtains knowledge through it leading tutor the leader is acutely sensitive to the progress of the follower and slows down when the follower lag and speed up when the follower get too closecontrolled experiment with colony of cerapachys biroi suggest that an individual may choose nest role based on her previous experience an entire generation of identical worker wa divided into two group whose outcome in food foraging wa controlled one group wa continually rewarded with prey while it wa made certain that the other failed a a result member of the successful group intensified their foraging attempt while the unsuccessful group ventured out fewer and fewer time a month later the successful forager continued in their role while the others had moved to specialise in brood care nest construction complex nest are built by many ant specie but other specie are nomadic and do not build permanent structure ant may form subterranean nest or build them on tree these nest may be found in the ground under stone or log inside log hollow stem or even acorn the material used for construction include soil and plant matter and ant carefully select their nest site temnothorax albipennis will avoid site with dead ant a these may indicate the presence of pest or disease they are quick to abandon established nest at the first sign of threatsthe army ant of south america such a the eciton burchellii specie and the driver ant of africa do not build permanent nest but instead alternate between nomadism and stage where the worker form a temporary nest bivouac from their own body by holding each other togetherweaver ant oecophylla spp worker build nest in tree by attaching leaf together first pulling them together with bridge of worker and then inducing their larva to produce silk a they are moved along the leaf edge similar form of nest construction are seen in some specie of polyrhachisformica polyctena among other ant specie construct nest that maintain a relatively constant interior temperature that aid in the development of larva the ant maintain the nest temperature by choosing the location nest material controlling ventilation and maintaining the heat from solar radiation worker activity and metabolism and in some moist nest microbial activity in the nest materialssome ant specie such a those that use natural cavity can be opportunistic and make use of the controlled provided inside human dwelling and other artificial structure to house their colony and nest structure ant bridge cultivation of food most ant are generalist predator scavenger and indirect herbivore but a few have evolved specialised way of obtaining nutrition it is believed that many ant specie that engage in indirect herbivory rely on specialized symbiosis with their gut microbe to upgrade the nutritional value of the food they collect and allow them to survive in nitrogen poor region such a rainforest canopy leafcutter ant atta and acromyrmex feed exclusively on a fungus that grows only within their colony they continually collect leaf which are taken to the colony cut into tiny piece and placed in fungal garden ergates specialise in related task according to their size the largest ant cut stalk smaller worker chew the leaf and the smallest tend the fungus leafcutter ant are sensitive enough to recognise the reaction of the fungus to different plant material apparently detecting chemical signal from the fungus if a particular type of leaf is found to be toxic to the fungus the colony will no longer collect it the ant feed on structure produced by the fungi called gongylidia symbiotic bacteria on the exterior surface of the ant produce antibiotic that kill bacteria introduced into the nest that may harm the fungi navigation foraging ant travel distance of up to metre ft from their nest and scent trail allow them to find their way back even in the dark in hot and arid region ant face death by desiccation so the ability to find the shortest route back to the nest reduces that risk diurnal desert ant of the genus cataglyphis such a the sahara desert ant navigate by keeping track of direction a well a distance travelled distance travelled are measured using an internal pedometer that keep count of the step taken and also by evaluating the movement of object in their visual field optical flow direction are measured using the position of the sun they integrate this information to find the shortest route back to their nest like all ant they can also make use of visual landmark when available a well a olfactory and tactile cue to navigate some specie of ant are able to use the earth magnetic field for navigation the compound eye of ant have specialised cell that detect polarised light from the sun which is used to determine direction these polarization detector are sensitive in the ultraviolet region of the light spectrum in some army ant specie a group of forager who become separated from the main column may sometimes turn back on themselves and form a circular ant mill the worker may then run around continuously until they die of exhaustion locomotion the female worker ant do not have wing and reproductive female lose their wing after their mating flight in order to begin their colony therefore unlike their wasp ancestor most ant travel by walking some specie are capable of leaping for example jerdon jumping ant harpegnathos saltator is able to jump by synchronising the action of it mid and hind pair of leg there are several specie of gliding ant including cephalotes atratus this may be a common trait among arboreal ant with small colony ant with this ability are able to control their horizontal movement so a to catch tree trunk when they fall from atop the forest canopyother specie of ant can form chain to bridge gap over water underground or through space in vegetation some specie also form floating raft that help them survive flood these raft may also have a role in allowing ant to colonise island polyrhachis sokolova a specie of ant found in australian mangrove swamp can swim and live in underwater nest since they lack gill they go to trapped pocket of air in the submerged nest to breathe cooperation and competition not all ant have the same kind of society the australian bulldog ant are among the biggest and most basal of ant like virtually all ant they are eusocial but their social behaviour is poorly developed compared to other specie each individual hunt alone using her large eye instead of chemical sens to find preysome specie such a tetramorium caespitum attack and take over neighbouring ant colony others are le expansionist but just a aggressive they invade colony to steal egg or larva which they either eat or raise a worker or slave extreme specialist among these ant such a the amazon ant are incapable of feeding themselves and need captured worker to survive captured worker of enslaved temnothorax specie have evolved a counter strategy destroying just the female pupa of the temnothorax americanus but sparing the male who do take part in a adult ant identify kin and nestmates through their scent which come from secretion that coat their exoskeleton if an ant is separated from it original colony it will eventually lose the colony scent any ant that enters a colony without a matching scent will be attacked also the reason why two separate colony of ant will attack each other even if they are of the same specie is because the gene responsible for pheromone production are different between them the argentine ant however doe not have this characteristic due to lack of genetic diversity and ha become a global pest because of it parasitic ant specie enter the colony of host ant and establish themselves a social parasite specie such a strumigenys xenos are entirely parasitic and do not have worker but instead rely on the food gathered by their strumigenys perplexa host this form of parasitism is seen across many ant genus but the parasitic ant is usually a specie that is closely related to it host a variety of method are employed to enter the nest of the host ant a parasitic queen may enter the host nest before the first brood ha hatched establishing herself prior to development of a colony scent other specie use pheromone to confuse the host ant or to trick them into carrying the parasitic queen into the nest some simply fight their way into the nesta conflict between the sex of a specie is seen in some specie of ant with these reproducer apparently competing to produce offspring that are a closely related to them a possible the most extreme form involves the production of clonal offspring an extreme of sexual conflict is seen in wasmannia auropunctata where the queen produce diploid daughter by thelytokous parthenogenesis and male produce clone by a process whereby a diploid egg loses it maternal contribution to produce haploid male who are clone of the father relationship with other organism ant form symbiotic association with a range of specie including other ant specie other insect plant and fungi they also are preyed on by many animal and even certain fungi some arthropod specie spend part of their life within ant nest either preying on ant their larva and egg consuming the food store of the ant or avoiding predator these inquilines may bear a close resemblance to ant the nature of this ant mimicry myrmecomorphy varies with some case involving batesian mimicry where the mimic reduces the risk of predation others show wasmannian mimicry a form of mimicry seen only in inquilines aphid and other hemipteran insect secrete a sweet liquid called honeydew when they feed on plant sap the sugar in honeydew are a food source which many ant specie collect in some case the aphid secrete the honeydew in response to ant tapping them with their antenna the ant in turn keep predator away from the aphid and will move them from one feeding location to another when migrating to a new area many colony will take the aphid with them to ensure a continued supply of honeydew ant also tend mealybug to harvest their honeydew mealybug may become a serious pest of pineapple if ant are present to protect mealybug from their natural enemiesmyrmecophilous caterpillar of the butterfly family lycaenidae eg blue copper or hairstreak are herded by the ant led to feeding area in the daytime and brought inside the ant nest at night the caterpillar have a gland which secretes honeydew when the ant massage them some caterpillar produce vibration and sound that are perceived by the ant a similar adaptation can be seen in grizzled skipper butterfly that emit vibration by expanding their wing in order to communicate with ant which are natural predator of these butterfly other caterpillar have evolved from to these myrmecophagous caterpillar secrete a pheromone that make the ant act a if the caterpillar is one of their own larva the caterpillar is then taken into the ant nest where it feed on the ant larva a number of specialized bacteria have been found a endosymbionts in ant gut some of the dominant bacteria belong to the order rhizobiales whose member are known for being symbionts in legume but the specie found in ant lack the ability to fix nitrogen ant that make up the tribe attini including leafcutter ant cultivate certain specie of fungus in the genus leucoagaricus or leucocoprinus of the family agaricaceae in this mutualism both specie depend on each other for survival the ant allomerus decemarticulatus ha evolved a association with the host plant hirtella physophora chrysobalanaceae and a sticky fungus which is used to trap their insect prey lemon ant make devil garden by killing surrounding plant with their sting and leaving a pure patch of lemon ant tree duroia hirsuta this modification of the forest provides the ant with more nesting site inside the stem of the duroia tree although some ant obtain nectar from flower pollination by ant is somewhat rare one example being of the pollination of the orchid leporella fimbriata which induces male myrmecia urens to pseudocopulate with the flower transferring pollen in the process one theory that ha been proposed for the rarity of pollination is that the secretion of the metapleural gland inactivate and reduce the viability of pollen some plant have special nectar exuding structure extrafloral nectary that provide food for ant which in turn protect the plant from more damaging herbivorous insect specie such a the bullhorn acacia acacia cornigera in central america have hollow thorn that house colony of stinging ant pseudomyrmex ferruginea who defend the tree against insect browsing mammal and epiphytic vine isotopic labelling study suggest that plant also obtain nitrogen from the ant in return the ant obtain food from and beltian body in fiji philidris nagasau dolichoderinae are known to selectively grow specie of epiphytic squamellaria rubiaceae which produce large domatium inside which the ant colony nest the ant plant the seed and the domatium of young seedling are immediately occupied and the ant faeces in them contribute to rapid growth similar dispersal association are found with other dolichoderines in the region a well another example of this type of ectosymbiosis come from the macaranga tree which ha stem adapted to house colony of crematogaster antsmany plant specie have seed that are adapted for dispersal by ant seed dispersal by ant or myrmecochory is widespread and new estimate suggest that nearly of all plant specie may have such ant association often ant perform directed dispersal depositing the seed in location that increase the likelihood of seed survival to reproduction some plant in arid system are particularly dependent on ant for their survival and dispersal a the seed are transported to safety below the ground many seed have special external structure elaiosomes that are sought after by ant a fooda convergence possibly a form of mimicry is seen in the egg of stick insect they have an edible structure and are taken into the ant nest where the young hatch most ant are predatory and some prey on and obtain food from other social insect including other ant some specie specialise in preying on termite megaponera and termitopone while a few cerapachyinae prey on other ant some termite including nasutitermes corniger form association with certain ant specie to keep away predatory ant specie the tropical wasp mischocyttarus drewseni coat the pedicel of it nest with an chemical it is suggested that many tropical wasp may build their nest in tree and cover them to protect themselves from ant other wasp such a a multipicta defend against ant by blasting them off the nest with burst of wing buzzing stingless bee trigona and melipona use chemical defence against antsflies in the old world genus bengalia calliphoridae prey on ant and are kleptoparasites snatching prey or brood from the mandible of adult ant wingless and legless female of the malaysian phorid fly vestigipoda myrmolarvoidea live in the nest of ant of the genus aenictus and are cared for by the antsfungi in the genus cordyceps and ophiocordyceps infect ant ant react to their infection by climbing up plant and sinking their mandible into plant tissue the fungus kill the ant grows on their remains and produce a fruiting body it appears that the fungus alters the behaviour of the ant to help disperse it spore in a microhabitat that best suit the fungus strepsipteran parasite also manipulate their ant host to climb grass stem to help the parasite find matesa nematode myrmeconema neotropicum that infects canopy ant cephalotes atratus cause the gasters of worker to turn red the parasite also alters the behaviour of the ant causing them to carry their gasters high the conspicuous red gasters are mistaken by bird for ripe fruit such a hyeronima alchorneoides and eaten the droppings of the bird are collected by other ant and fed to their young leading to further spread of the nematode south american poison dart frog in the genus dendrobates feed mainly on ant and the toxin in their skin may come from the antsarmy ant forage in a wide roving column attacking any animal in that path that are unable to escape in central and south america eciton burchellii is the swarming ant most commonly attended by bird such a antbird and woodcreeper this behaviour wa once considered mutualistic but later study found the bird to be parasitic direct kleptoparasitism bird stealing food from the ant grasp is rare and ha been noted in inca dove which pick seed at nest entrance a they are being transported by specie of pogonomyrmex bird that follow ant eat many prey insect and thus decrease the foraging success of ant bird indulge in a peculiar behaviour called anting that a yet is not fully understood here bird rest on ant nest or pick and drop ant onto their wing and feather this may be a mean to remove ectoparasite from the bird anteater aardvark pangolin echidna and numbat have special adaptation for living on a diet of ant these adaptation include long sticky tongue to capture ant and strong claw to break into ant nest brown bear ursus arctos have been found to feed on ant about and of their faecal volume in spring summer and autumn respectively is composed of ant relationship with human ant perform many ecological role that are beneficial to human including the suppression of pest population and aeration of the soil the use of weaver ant in citrus cultivation in southern china is considered one of the oldest known application of biological control on the other hand ant may become nuisance when they invade building or cause economic loss in some part of the world mainly africa and south america large ant especially army ant are used a surgical suture the wound is pressed together and ant are applied along it the ant seizes the edge of the wound in it mandible and lock in place the body is then cut off and the head and mandible remain in place to close the wound the large head of the dinergates
