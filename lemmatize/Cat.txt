the cat felis catus is a domestic specie of small carnivorous mammal it is the only domesticated specie in the family felidae and is often referred to a the domestic cat to distinguish it from the wild member of the family a cat can either be a house cat a farm cat or a feral cat the latter range freely and avoids human contact domestic cat are valued by human for companionship and their ability to hunt rodent about cat breed are recognized by various cat registriesthe cat is similar in anatomy to the other felid specie it ha a strong flexible body quick reflex sharp teeth and retractable claw adapted to killing small prey it night vision and sense of smell are well developed cat communication includes vocalization like meowing purring trilling hissing growling and grunting a well a body language it is a solitary hunter but a social specie it can hear sound too faint or too high in frequency for human ear such a those made by mouse and other small mammal it is a predator that is most active at dawn and dusk it secretes and perceives pheromonesfemale domestic cat can have kitten from spring to late autumn with litter size often ranging from two to five kitten domestic cat are bred and shown at event a registered pedigreed cat a hobby known a cat fancy failure to control breeding of pet cat by spaying and neutering a well a abandonment of pet resulted in large number of feral cat worldwide contributing to the extinction of entire bird mammal and reptile specie and evoking population controlcats were first domesticated in the near east around bce it wa long thought that cat domestication wa initiated in ancient egypt a since around bce veneration wa given to cat in ancient egypt a of the domestic cat wa the popular pet in the united state with million cat owned in the united kingdom around million cat lived in more than million household a of etymology and naming the origin of the english word old english catt is thought to be the late latin word cattus which wa first used at the beginning of the century it wa suggested that the word is derived from an egyptian precursor of coptic sh sau tomcat or it feminine form suffixed with the late latin word is also thought to be derived from language the nubian word kaddiska wildcat and nobiin kadis are possible source or cognate the nubian word may be a loan from arabic qatt qitt it is equally likely that the form might derive from an ancient germanic word imported into latin and thence to greek and to syriac and arabic the word may be derived from germanic and northern european language and ultimately be borrowed from uralic cf northern sami gadfi female stoat and hungarian holgy stoat from kadwa female of a furred animal the english pus extended a pussy and pussycat is attested from the century and may have been introduced from dutch poe or from low german puuskatte related to swedish kattepus or norwegian pu pusekatt similar form exist in lithuanian puize and irish puisin or puiscin the etymology of this word is unknown but it may have simply arisen from a sound used to attract a cata male cat is called a tom or tomcat or a gib if neutered an unspayed female is called a queen especially in a context a juvenile cat is referred to a a kitten in early modern english the word kitten wa interchangeable with the word catling a group of cat can be referred to a a clowder or a glaring taxonomy the scientific name felis catus wa proposed by carl linnaeus in for a domestic catfelis catus domesticus wa proposed by johann christian polycarp erxleben in daemon proposed by konstantin alekseevich satunin in wa a black cat from the transcaucasus later identified a a domestic catin the international commission on zoological nomenclature ruled that the domestic cat is a distinct specie namely felis catus in it wa considered a subspecies of the european wildcat f silvestris catus following result of phylogenetic research in the iucn cat classification taskforce followed the recommendation of the iczn in regarding the domestic cat a a distinct specie felis catus evolution the domestic cat is a member of the felidae a family that had a common ancestor about million year ago the genus felis diverged from the felidae around million year ago result of phylogenetic research confirm that the wild felis specie evolved through sympatric or parapatric speciation whereas the domestic cat evolved through artificial selection the domesticated cat and it closest wild ancestor are both diploid organism that posse chromosome and roughly gene the leopard cat prionailurus bengalensis wa tamed independently in china around bce this line of partially domesticated cat leaf no trace in the domestic cat population of today domestication the earliest known indication for the taming of an african wildcat f lybica wa excavated close by a human neolithic grave in shillourokambos southern cyprus dating to about to year before present since there is no evidence of native mammalian fauna on cyprus the inhabitant of this neolithic village most likely brought the cat and other wild mammal to the island from the middle eastern mainland scientist therefore assume that african wildcat were attracted to early human settlement in the fertile crescent by rodent in particular the house mouse mu musculus and were tamed by neolithic farmer this commensal relationship between early farmer and tamed cat lasted thousand of year a agricultural practice spread so did tame and domesticated cat wildcat of egypt contributed to the maternal gene pool of the domestic cat at a later time the earliest known evidence for the occurrence of the domestic cat in greece date to around bce greek phoenician carthaginian and etruscan trader introduced domestic cat to southern europe during the roman empire they were introduced to corsica and sardinia before the beginning of the millennium by the century bce they were familiar animal around settlement in magna graecia and etruria by the end of the roman empire in the century the egyptian domestic cat lineage had arrived in a baltic sea port in northern germanyduring domestication cat have undergone only minor change in anatomy and behavior and they are still capable of surviving in the wild several natural behavior and characteristic of wildcat may have them for domestication a pet these trait include their small size social nature obvious body language love of play and relatively high intelligence captive leopardus cat may also display affectionate behavior toward human but were not domesticated house cat often mate with feral cat producing hybrid such a the kellas cat in scotland hybridisation between domestic and other felinae specie is also possibledevelopment of cat breed started in the mid century an analysis of the domestic cat genome revealed that the ancestral wildcat genome wa significantly altered in the process of domestication a specific mutation were selected to develop cat breed most breed are founded on domestic cat genetic diversity of these breed varies between region and is lowest in purebred population which show more than deleterious genetic disorder characteristic size the domestic cat ha a smaller skull and shorter bone than the european wildcat it average about cm in in length and cm in in height with about cm in long tail male are larger than female adult domestic cat typically weigh between and kg and lb skeleton cat have seven cervical vertebra a do most mammal thoracic vertebra human have seven lumbar vertebra human have five three sacral vertebra a do most mammal but human have five and a variable number of caudal vertebra in the tail human have only vestigial caudal vertebra fused into an internal coccyx the extra lumbar and thoracic vertebra account for the cat spinal mobility and flexibility attached to the spine are rib the shoulder and the pelvis unlike human arm cat forelimb are attached to the shoulder by clavicle bone which allow them to pas their body through any space into which they can fit their head skull the cat skull is unusual among mammal in having very large eye socket and a powerful specialized jaw within the jaw cat have teeth adapted for killing prey and tearing meat when it overpowers it prey a cat delivers a lethal neck bite with it two long canine teeth inserting them between two of the prey vertebra and severing it spinal cord causing irreversible paralysis and death compared to other feline domestic cat have narrowly spaced canine teeth relative to the size of their jaw which is an adaptation to their preferred prey of small rodent which have small vertebra the premolar and first molar together compose the carnassial pair on each side of the mouth which efficiently shear meat into small piece like a pair of scissors these are vital in feeding since cat small molar can not chew food effectively and cat are largely incapable of mastication although cat tend to have better teeth than most human with decay generally le likely because of a thicker protective layer of enamel a le damaging saliva le retention of food particle between teeth and a diet mostly devoid of sugar they are nonetheless subject to occasional tooth loss and infection ambulation the cat is digitigrade it walk on the toe with the bone of the foot making up the lower part of the visible leg unlike most mammal it us a pacing gait and move both leg on one side of the body before the leg on the other side it register directly by placing each hind paw close to the track of the corresponding fore paw minimizing noise and visible track this also provides sure footing for hind paw when navigating rough terrain a it speed up walking to trotting it gait change to a diagonal gait the diagonally opposite hind and fore leg move simultaneously claw cat have protractable and retractable claw in their normal relaxed position the claw are sheathed with the skin and fur around the paw toe pad this keep the claw sharp by preventing wear from contact with the ground and allows the silent stalking of prey the claw on the fore foot are typically sharper than those on the hind foot cat can voluntarily extend their claw on one or more paw they may extend their claw in hunting or climbing kneading or for extra traction on soft surface cat shed the outside layer of their claw sheath when scratching rough surfacesmost cat have five claw on their front paw and four on their rear paw the dewclaw is proximal to the other claw more proximally is a protrusion which appears to be a sixth finger this special feature of the front paw on the inside of the wrist ha no function in normal walking but is thought to be an antiskidding device used while jumping some cat breed are prone to having extra digit polydactyly polydactylous cat occur along north america northeast coast and in great britain sens vision cat have excellent night vision and can see at only the light level required for human vision this is partly the result of cat eye having a tapetum lucidum which reflects any light that pass through the retina back into the eye thereby increasing the eye sensitivity to dim light large pupil are an adaptation to dim light the domestic cat ha slit pupil which allow it to focus bright light without chromatic aberration at low light a cat pupil expand to cover most of the exposed surface of it eye however the domestic cat ha rather poor color vision and only two type of cone cell optimized for sensitivity to blue and yellowish green it ability to distinguish between red and green is limited a response to middle wavelength from a system other than the rod cell might be due to a third type of cone however this appears to be an adaptation to low light level rather than representing true trichromatic vision hearing the domestic cat hearing is most acute in the range of hz to khz it can detect an extremely broad range of frequency ranging from hz to hz it can hear a range of octave while human and dog can hear range of about octave it hearing sensitivity is enhanced by it large movable outer ear the pinna which amplify sound and help detect the location of a noise it can detect ultrasound which enables it to detect ultrasonic call made by rodent prey smell cat have an acute sense of smell due in part to their olfactory bulb and a large surface of olfactory mucosa about square centimetre square inch in area which is about twice that of human cat and many other animal have a jacobson organ in their mouth that is used in the behavioral process of flehmening it allows them to sense certain aroma in a way that human can not cat are sensitive to pheromone such a which they use to communicate through urine spraying and marking with scent gland many cat also respond strongly to plant that contain nepetalactone especially catnip a they can detect that substance at le than one part per billion about of cat are affected by nepetalactone this response is also produced by other plant such a silver vine actinidia polygama and the herb valerian it may be caused by the smell of these plant mimicking a pheromone and stimulating cat social or sexual behavior taste cat have relatively few taste bud compared to human or so versus more than on the human tongue domestic and wild cat share a taste receptor gene mutation that keep their sweet taste bud from binding to sugary molecule leaving them with no ability to taste sweetness their taste bud instead respond to acid amino acid like protein and bitter taste cat also have a distinct temperature preference for their food preferring food with a temperature around which is similar to that of a fresh kill and routinely rejecting food presented cold or refrigerated which would signal to the cat that the prey item is long dead and therefore possibly toxic or decomposing whisker to aid with navigation and sensation cat have dozen of movable whisker vibrissa over their body especially their face these provide information on the width of gap and on the location of object in the dark both by touching object directly and by sensing air current they also trigger protective blink reflex to protect the eye from damage balance most breed of cat have a noted fondness for sitting in high place or perching a higher place may serve a a concealed site from which to hunt domestic cat strike prey by pouncing from a perch such a a tree branch another possible explanation is that height give the cat a better observation point allowing it to survey it territory a cat falling from height of up to meter can right itself and land on it paw during a fall from a high place a cat reflexively twist it body and right itself to land on it foot using it acute sense of balance and flexibility this reflex is known a the cat righting reflex a cat always right itself in the same way during a fall if it ha enough time to do so which is the case in fall of cm ft in or more how cat are able to right themselves when falling ha been investigated a the falling cat problem behavior outdoor cat are active both day and night although they tend to be slightly more active at night domestic cat spend the majority of their time in the vicinity of their home but can range many hundred of meter from this central point they establish territory that vary considerably in size in one study ranging from to hectare acre the timing of cat activity is quite flexible and varied which mean house cat may be more active in the morning and evening a a response to greater human activity at these timescats conserve energy by sleeping more than most animal especially a they grow older the daily duration of sleep varies usually between and hour with and being the average some cat can sleep a much a hour the term cat nap for a short rest refers to the cat tendency to fall asleep lightly for a brief period while asleep cat experience short period of rapid eye movement sleep often accompanied by muscle twitch which suggests they are dreaming sociability the social behavior of the domestic cat range from widely dispersed individual to feral cat colony that gather around a food source based on group of female within such group one cat is usually dominant over the others each cat in a colony hold a distinct territory with sexually active male having the largest territory which are about time larger than those of female cat and may overlap with several female territory these territory are marked by urine spraying by rubbing object at head height with secretion from facial gland and by defecation between these territory are neutral area where cat watch and greet one another without territorial conflict outside these neutral area territory holder usually chase away stranger cat at first by staring hissing and growling and if that doe not work by short but noisy and violent attack despite some cat cohabiting in colony they do not have a social survival strategy or a pack mentality and always hunt alonehowever some pet cat are poorly socialized in particular older cat show aggressiveness towards newly arrived kitten which include biting and scratching this type of behavior is known a feline asocial aggressionlife in proximity to human and other domestic animal ha led to a symbiotic social adaptation in cat and cat may express great affection toward human or other animal ethologically the human keeper of a cat function a a sort of surrogate for the cat mother adult cat live their life in a kind of extended kittenhood a form of behavioral neoteny their sound may mimic the cry of a hungry human infant making them particularly difficult for human to ignoredomestic cat scent rubbing behavior towards human or other cat is thought to be a feline mean for social bonding communication domestic cat use many vocalization for communication including purring trilling hissing grunting and several different form of meowing their body language including position of ear and tail relaxation of the whole body and kneading of the paw are all indicator of mood the tail and ear are particularly important social signal mechanism in cat a raised tail indicates a friendly greeting and flattened ear indicates hostility also indicates the cat position in the group social hierarchy with dominant individual raising their tail le often than subordinate one feral cat are generally silent touching is also a common greeting and may be followed by social grooming which is solicited by one of the cat raising and tilting it headpurring may have developed a an evolutionary advantage a a signalling mechanism of reassurance between mother cat and nursing kitten cat often purr a a sign of contentment when being petted becoming relaxed or eating the mechanism by which cat purr is elusive the cat ha no unique anatomical feature that is clearly responsible for the sound grooming cat are known for spending considerable amount of time licking their coat to keep them clean the cat tongue ha spine about mm long which are called papilla these contain keratin which make them rigid so the papilla act like a hairbrush some cat particularly longhaired cat occasionally regurgitate hairball of fur that have collected in their stomach from grooming these clump of fur are usually and about cm in long hairball can be prevented with remedy that ease elimination of the hair through the gut a well a regular grooming of the coat with a comb or stiff brush fighting among domestic cat male are more likely to fight than female among feral cat the most common reason for cat fighting is competition between two male to mate with a female in such case most fight are won by the heavier male another common reason for fighting in domestic cat is the difficulty of establishing territory within a small home female cat also fight over territory or to defend their kitten neutering will decrease or eliminate this behavior in many case suggesting that the behavior is linked to sex hormoneswhen cat become aggressive they try to make themselves appear larger and more threatening by raising their fur arching their back turning sideways and hissing or spitting often the ear are pointed down and back to avoid damage to the inner ear and potentially listen for any change behind them while focused forward they may also vocalize loudly and bare their teeth in an effort to further intimidate their opponent fight usually consist of grappling and delivering powerful slap to the face and body with the forepaw a well a bite cat also throw themselves to the ground in a defensive posture to rake their opponent belly with their powerful hind legsserious damage is rare a the fight are usually short in duration with the loser running away with little more than a few scratch to the face and ear however fight for mating right are typically more severe and injury may include deep puncture wound and laceration normally serious injury from fighting are limited to infection of scratch and bite though these can occasionally kill cat if untreated in addition bite are probably the main route of transmission of feline immunodeficiency virus sexually active male are usually involved in many fight during their life and often have decidedly battered face with obvious scar and cut to their ear and nose hunting and feeding the shape and structure of cat cheek is insufficient to suck they lap with the tongue to draw liquid upwards into their mouth lapping at a rate of four time a second the cat touch the smooth tip of it tongue to the surface of the water and quickly retracts it like a corkscrew drawing water upwardsferal cat and house cat consume several small meal in a day the frequency and size of meal varies between individual they select food based on it temperature smell and texture they dislike chilled food and respond most strongly to moist food rich in amino acid which are similar to meat cat reject novel flavor a response termed neophobia and learn quickly to avoid food that have tasted unpleasant in the past they also avoid sweet food and milk most adult cat are lactose intolerant the sugar in milk is not easily digested and may cause soft stool or diarrhea some also develop odd eating habit and like to eat or chew on thing like wool plastic cable paper string aluminum foil or even coal this condition pica can threaten their health depending on the amount and toxicity of the item eatencats hunt small prey primarily bird and rodent and are often used a a form of pest control cat use two hunting strategy either stalking prey actively or waiting in ambush until an animal come close enough to be captured the strategy used depends on the prey specie in the area with cat waiting in ambush outside burrow but tending to actively stalk bird domestic cat are a major predator of wildlife in the united state killing an estimated to billion bird and to billion mammal annually certain specie appear more susceptible than others for example of house sparrow mortality is linked to the domestic cat in the recovery of ringed robin erithacus rubecula and dunnock prunella modularis of death were a result of cat predation in part of north america the presence of larger carnivore such a coyote which prey on cat and other small predator reduces the effect of predation by cat and other small predator such a opossum and raccoon on bird number and variety perhaps the element of cat hunting behavior which is commonly misunderstood and often appalls cat owner because it look like torture is that cat often appear to play with prey by releasing it after capture this cat and mouse behavior is due to an instinctive imperative to ensure that the prey is weak enough to be killed without endangering the cat another poorly understood element of cat hunting behavior is the presentation of prey to human guardian one explanation is that cat adopt human into their social group and share excess kill with others in the group according to the dominance hierarchy in which human are reacted to a if they are at or near the top another explanation is that they attempt to teach their guardian to hunt or to help their human a if feeding an elderly cat or an inept kitten this hypothesis is inconsistent with the fact that male cat also bring home prey despite male having negligible involvement in raising kitten impact on wildlife on island bird can contribute a much a of a cat diet in nearly all case however the cat can not be identified a the sole cause for reducing the number of island bird and in some instance eradication of cat ha caused a mesopredator release effect where the suppression of top carnivore creates an abundance of smaller predator that cause a severe decline in their shared prey domestic cat are however known to be a contributing factor to the decline of many specie a factor that ha ultimately led in some case to extinction the south island piopio chatham rail and the new zealand merganser are a few from a long list with the most extreme case being the flightless lyall wren which wa driven to extinction only a few year after it discovery one feral cat in new zealand killed new zealand lesser bat in seven day in the u feral and domestic cat kill an estimated billion mammal annuallyin australia the impact of cat on mammal population is even greater than the impact of habitat loss more than one million reptile are killed by feral cat each day representing specie cat have contributed to the extinction of the navassa lizard and chioninia coctei play domestic cat especially young kitten are known for their love of play this behavior mimic hunting and is important in helping kitten learn to stalk capture and kill prey cat also engage in play fighting with each other and with human this behavior may be a way for cat to practice the skill needed for real combat and might also reduce any fear they associate with launching attack on other animalscats also tend to play with toy more when they are hungry owing to the close similarity between play and hunting cat prefer to play with object that resemble prey such a small furry toy that move rapidly but rapidly lose interest they become habituated to a toy they have played with before string is often used a a toy but if it is eaten it can become caught at the base of the cat tongue and then move into the intestine a medical emergency which can cause serious illness even death owing to the risk posed by cat eating string it is sometimes replaced with a laser pointer dot which cat may chase reproduction female cat called queen are polyestrous with several estrus cycle during a year lasting usually day they are usually ready to mate between early february and augustseveral male called tomcat are attracted to a female in heat they fight over her and the victor win the right to mate at first the female reject the male but eventually the female allows the male to mate the female utters a loud yowl a the male pull out of her because a male cat penis ha a band of about penile spine which are about mm in long upon withdrawal of the penis the spine rake the wall of the female vagina which act to induce ovulation this act also occurs to clear the vagina of other sperm in the context of a second or more mating thus giving the later male a larger chance of conceptionafter mating the female clean her vulva thoroughly if a male attempt to mate with her at this point the female attack him after about to minute once the female is finished grooming the cycle will repeat because ovulation is not always triggered by a single mating female may not be impregnated by the first male with which they mate furthermore cat are superfecund that is a female may mate with more than one male when she is in heat with the result that different kitten in a litter may have different fathersthe morula form hour after conception at hour early blastocyst form at day implantation occurs the gestation of queen last between and day with an average of day data on the reproductive capacity of more than queen were collected during a study between may and october they had one to six kitten per litter with an average of three kitten they produced a mean of litter per year but a maximum of three litter in a year of kitten died before they were six month old due to a trauma caused in most case by dog attack and road accident the first litter is usually smaller than subsequent litter kitten are weaned between six and seven week of age queen normally reach sexual maturity at month and male at month this varies depending on breed kitten reach puberty at the age of monthscats are ready to go to new home at about week of age when they are ready to leave their mother they can be surgically sterilized spayed or castrated a early a seven week to limit unwanted reproduction this surgery also prevents undesirable behavior such a aggression territory marking spraying urine in male and yowling calling in female traditionally this surgery wa performed at around six to nine month of age but it is increasingly being performed before puberty at about three to six month in the united state about of household cat are neutered lifespan and health the average lifespan of pet cat ha risen in recent decade in the early it wa about seven year rising to year in and year in some cat have been reported a surviving into their with the oldest known cat creme puff dying at a verified age of or neutering increase life expectancy one study found neutered male cat live twice a long a intact male while spayed female cat live longer than intact female having a cat neutered confers health benefit because castrated male can not develop testicular cancer spayed female can not develop uterine or ovarian cancer and both have a reduced risk of mammary cancerdespite widespread concern about the welfare of cat the lifespan of neutered feral cat in managed colony compare favorably with those of pet cat disease about two hundred fifty heritable genetic disorder have been identified in cat many similar to human inborn error of metabolism the high level of similarity among the metabolism of mammal allows many of these feline disease to be diagnosed using genetic test that were originally developed for use in human a well a the use of cat a animal model in the study of the human disease disease affecting domestic cat include acute infection parasitic infestation injury and chronic disease such a kidney disease thyroid disease and arthritis vaccination are available for many infectious disease a are treatment to eliminate parasite such a worm and flea ecology habitat the domestic cat is a cosmopolitan specie and occurs across much of the world it is adaptable and now present on all continent except antarctica and on of the main group of on isolated island such a the kerguelen island due to it ability to thrive in almost any terrestrial habitat it is among the world most invasive specie a it is little altered from the wildcat it can readily interbreed with the wildcat this hybridization pose a danger to the genetic distinctiveness of some wildcat population particularly in scotland and hungary and possibly also the iberian peninsula it life on small island with no human inhabitant feral cat can live in forest grassland tundra coastal area agricultural land scrubland urban area and wetland feral cat feral cat are domestic cat that were born in or have reverted to a wild state they are unfamiliar with and wary of human and roam freely in urban and rural area the number of feral cat is not known but estimate of the united state feral population range from to sixty million feral cat may live alone but most are found in large colony which occupy a specific territory and are usually associated with a source of food famous feral cat colony are found in rome around the colosseum and forum romanum with cat at some of these site being fed and given medical attention by volunteerspublic attitude towards feral cat vary widely ranging from seeing them a pet to regarding them a vermin one common approach to reducing the feral cat population is termed where the cat are trapped neutered immunized against disease such a rabies and the feline panleukopenia and leukemia virus and then released before releasing them back into their feral colony the attending veterinarian often nip the tip off one ear to mark it a neutered and inoculated since these cat may be trapped again volunteer continue to feed and give care to these cat throughout their life given this support their lifespan are increased and behavior and nuisance problem caused by competition for food are reducedsome feral cat can be successfully socialised and for adoption young cat especially kitten and cat that have had prior experience and contact with human are the most receptive to these effort interaction with human cat are common pet throughout the world and their worldwide population exceeds million a of cat have been used for millennium to control rodent notably around grain store and aboard ship and both us extend to the present dayas well a being kept a pet cat are also used in the international fur and leather industry for making coat hat blanket and stuffed toy and shoe glove and musical instrument respectively about cat are needed to make a coat this use ha been outlawed in the united state australia and the european union in cat pelt have been used for superstitious purpose a part of the practise of witchcraft and are still made into blanket in switzerland a folk remedy believed to help rheumatism in the western intellectual tradition the idea of cat a everyday object have served to illustrate problem of quantum mechanic in the schrodinger cat thought experiment a few attempt to build a cat census have been made over the year both through association or national and international organization such a the canadian federation of humane society one and over the internet but such a task doe not seem simple to achieve general estimate for the global population of domestic cat range widely from anywhere between million to millionwalter chandoha made his career photographing cat after his image of loco an especially charming stray taken in were published around the world he is reported to have photographed cat during his career and maintained an archive of image that he drew from for publication during his lifetime cat show a cat show is a judged event in which the owner of cat compete to win title in various organization by entering their cat to be judged after a breed standard both pedigreed and companion moggy cat are admissible although the rule differ from organization to organization competing cat are compared to the applicable breed standard and assessed for temperament and apparent health the owner of those judged to be most ideal awarded a prize moggies are judged based on their temperament and healthy appearance some event also include activity judging such a trained navigation of obstacle course often at the end of the year all of the point accrued at various show are added up and more national and regional title are awarded to champion cat infection transmitted from cat to human cat can be infected or infested with virus bacteria fungus protozoan arthropod or worm that can transmit disease to human in some case the cat exhibit no symptom of the disease however the same disease can then become evident in a human the likelihood that a person will become diseased depends on the age and immune status of the person human who have cat living in their home or in close association are more likely to become infected however those who do not keep cat a pet might also acquire infection from cat feces and parasite exiting the cat body some of the infection of most concern include salmonella disease and toxoplasmosis history and mythology in ancient egypt cat were worshipped and the goddess bastet often depicted in cat form sometimes taking on the aspect of a lioness the greek historian herodotus reported that killing a cat wa forbidden and when a household cat died the entire family mourned and shaved their eyebrow family took their dead cat to the sacred city of bubastis where they were embalmed and buried in sacred repository herodotus expressed astonishment at the domestic cat in egypt because he had only ever seen wildcat ancient greek and roman kept weasel a pet which were seen a the ideal the earliest unmistakable evidence of the greek having domestic cat come from two coin from magna graecia dating to the century bc showing iokastos and phalanthos the legendary founder of rhegion and tara respectively playing with their pet cat the usual ancient greek word for wa ailouros meaning with the waving tail cat are rarely mentioned in ancient greek literature aristotle remarked in his history of animal that female cat are naturally lecherous the greek later syncretized their own goddess artemis with the egyptian goddess bastet adopting bastet association with cat and ascribing them to artemis in ovid metamorphosis when the deity flee to egypt and take animal form the goddess diana turn into a cat cat eventually displaced ferret a the pest control of choice because they were more pleasant to have around the house and were more enthusiastic hunter of mouse during the middle age many of artemis association with cat were grafted onto the virgin mary cat are often shown in icon of annunciation and of the holy family and according to italian folklore on the same night that mary gave birth to jesus a cat in bethlehem gave birth to a kitten domestic cat were spread throughout much of the rest of the world during the age of discovery a ship cat were carried on sailing ship to control shipboard rodent and a charmsseveral ancient religion believed cat are exalted soul companion or guide for human that are but mute so they can not influence decision made by human in japan the maneki neko cat is a symbol of good fortune in norse mythology freyja the goddess of love beauty and fertility is depicted a riding a chariot drawn by cat in jewish legend the first cat wa living in the house of the first man adam a a pet that got rid of mouse the cat wa once partnering with the first dog before the latter broke an oath they had made which resulted in enmity between the descendant of these two animal it is also written that neither cat nor fox are represented in the water while every other animal ha an incarnation specie in the water although no specie are sacred in islam cat are revered by muslim some western writer have stated muhammad had a favorite cat muezza he is reported to have loved cat so much he would do without his cloak rather than disturb one that wa sleeping on it the story ha no origin in early muslim writer and seems to confuse a story of a later sufi saint ahmed i century after muhammad one of the companion of muhammad wa known a abu hurayrah father of the kitten in reference to his documented affection to cat superstition and ritual many culture have negative superstition about cat an example would be the belief that a black cat crossing one path lead to bad luck or that cat are witch familiar used to augment a witch power and skill the killing of cat in medieval ypres belgium is commemorated in the innocuous kattenstoet cat parade in medieval france cat would be burnt alive a a form of entertainment according to norman davy the assembled people shrieked with laughter a the animal howling with pain were singed roasted and finally carbonized james frazer wrote that it wa the custom to burn a basket barrel or sack full of live cat which wa hung from a tall mast in the midst of the bonfire sometimes a fox wa burned the people collected the ember and ash of the fire and took them home believing that they brought good luck the french king often witnessed these spectacle and even lit the bonfire with their own hand in louis xiv crowned with a wreath of rose and carrying a bunch of rose in his hand kindled the fire danced at it and partook of the banquet afterwards in the town hall but this wa the last occasion when a monarch presided at the midsummer bonfire in paris at metz midsummer fire were lighted with great pomp on the esplanade and a dozen cat enclosed in wicker cage were burned alive in them to the amusement of the people similarly at gap in the department of the cat used to be roasted over the midsummer bonfire according to a myth in many culture cat have multiple life in many country they are believed to have nine life but in italy germany greece brazil and some region they are said to have seven life while in turkish and arabic tradition the number of life is six the myth is attributed to the natural suppleness and swiftness cat exhibit to escape situation also lending credence to this myth is the fact that falling cat often land on their foot using an instinctive righting reflex to twist their body around nonetheless cat can still be injured or killed by a high fall see also cat by
