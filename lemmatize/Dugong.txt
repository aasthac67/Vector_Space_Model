the dugong dugong dugon is a marine mammal it is one of four living specie of the order sirenia which also includes three specie of manatee it is the only living representative of the family dugongidae it closest modern relative steller sea cow hydrodamalis gigas wa hunted to extinction in the century the dugong is the only strictly herbivorous marine mammal the dugong is the only sirenian in it range which span the water of some country and territory throughout the pacific the dugong is largely dependent on seagrass community for subsistence and is thus restricted to the coastal habitat which support seagrass meadow with the largest dugong concentration typically occurring in wide shallow protected area such a bay mangrove channel the water of large inshore island and water the northern water of australia between shark bay and moreton bay are believed to be the dugong contemporary stronghold like all modern sirenian the dugong ha a fusiform body with no dorsal fin or hind limb the forelimb or flipper are the dugong is easily distinguished from the manatee by it fluked tail but also posse a unique skull and teeth it snout is sharply downturned an adaptation for feeding in benthic seagrass community the molar teeth are simple and unlike the more elaborate molar dentition of manatee the dugong ha been hunted for thousand of year for it meat and oil traditional hunting still ha great cultural significance in several country in it modern range particularly northern australia and the pacific island the dugong current distribution is fragmented and many population are believed to be close to extinction the iucn list the dugong a a specie vulnerable to extinction while the convention on international trade in endangered specie limit or ban the trade of derived product despite being legally protected in many country the main cause of population decline remain anthropogenic and include fatality habitat degradation and hunting with it long lifespan of year or more and slow rate of reproduction the dugong is especially vulnerable to extinction evolution dugong are part of the sirenia order of placental mammal which comprises modern sea cow manatee a well a dugong and their extinct relative sirenia are the only extant herbivorous marine mammal and the only group of herbivorous mammal to have become completely aquatic sirenian are thought to have a fossil record early they attained modest diversity during the oligocene and miocene but subsequently declined a a result of climatic cooling oceanographic change and human interference etymology and taxonomy the word dugong derives from the visayan probably cebuano dugung the name wa first adopted and popularized by the french naturalist leclerc comte de buffon a dugon in histoire naturelle after description of the animal from the island of leyte in the philippine other common local name include sea cow sea pig and sea camel dugong dugon is the only extant specie of the family dugongidae and one of only four extant specie of the sirenia order the others forming the manatee family it wa first classified by muller in a trichechus dugon a member of the manatee genus previously defined by linnaeus it wa later assigned a the type specie of dugong by lacepede and further classified within it own family by gray and subfamily by simpsondugongs and other sirenian are not closely related to other marine mammal being more related to elephant dugong and elephant share a monophyletic group with hyrax and the aardvark one of the earliest offshoot of eutherian the fossil record show sirenian appearing in the eocene where they most likely lived in the tethys ocean the two extant family of sirenian are thought to have diverged in the after which the dugong and their closest relative the steller sea cow split off from a common ancestor in the miocene the steller sea cow became extinct in the century no fossil exist of other member of the dugongidaemolecular study have been made on dugong population using mitochondrial dna the result have suggested that the population of southeast asia is distinct from the others australia ha two distinct maternal lineage one of which also contains the dugong from africa and arabia limited genetic mixing ha taken place between those in southeast asia and those in australia mostly around timor one of the lineage stretch all the way from moreton bay to western australia while the other only stretch from moreton bay to the northern territory there is not yet sufficient genetic data to make clear boundary between distinct group anatomy and morphology the dugong body is large with a cylindrical shape that taper at both end it ha thick smooth skin that is a pale cream colour at birth but darkens dorsally and laterally to with age the colour of a dugong can change due to the growth of algae on the skin the body is sparsely covered in short hair a common feature among sirenian which may allow for tactile interpretation of their environment these hair are most developed around the mouth which ha a large upper lip forming a highly mobile muzzle this muscular upper lip aid the dugong in foraging the dugong tail fluke and flipper are similar to those of dolphin these fluke are raised up and down in long stroke to move the animal forward and can be twisted to turn the forelimb are flipper which aid in turning and slowing the dugong lack nail on it flipper which are only of a dugong body length the tail ha deep notchesa dugong brain weighs a maximum of g oz about of the animal body weight with very small eye dugong have limited vision but acute hearing within narrow sound threshold their ear which lack pinna are located on the side of their head the nostril are located on top of the head and can be closed using valve dugong have two teat one located behind each flipper there are few difference between sex the body structure are almost the same a male testis are not externally located and the main difference between male and female is the location of the genital aperture in relation to the umbilicus and the anus the lung in a dugong are very long extending almost a far a the kidney which are also highly elongated in order to cope with the saltwater environment if the dugong is wounded it blood will clot rapidly the skull of a dugong is unique the skull is enlarged with sharply premaxilla which are stronger in male the spine ha between and vertebra unlike in manatee the dugong teeth do not continually grow back via horizontal tooth replacement the dugong ha two incisor tusk which emerge in male during puberty the female tusk continue to grow without emerging during puberty sometimes erupting later in life after reaching the base of the premaxilla the number of growth layer group in a tusk indicates the age of a dugong and the cheekteeth move forward with age the full dental formula of dugong is meaning they have two incisor three premolar and three molar on each side of their upper jaw and three incisor one canine three premolar and three molar on each side of their lower jaw like other sirenian the dugong experience pachyostosis a condition in which the rib and other long bone are unusually solid and contain little or no marrow these heavy bone which are among the densest in the animal kingdom may act a a ballast to help keep sirenian suspended slightly below the water surfacean adult length rarely exceeds metre ft an individual this long is expected to weigh around kilogram lb weight in adult is typically more than kilogram lb and le than kilogram lb the largest individual recorded wa metre ft long and weighed kilogram lb and wa found off the saurashtra coast of west india female tend to be larger than male distribution and habitat dugong are found in warm coastal water from the western pacific ocean to the eastern coast of africa along an estimated kilometre mi of coastline between and degree to the north and south of the equator their historic range is believed to correspond to that of seagrass from the potamogetonaceae and hydrocharitaceae family the full size of the former range is unknown although it is believed that the current population represent the historical limit of the range which is highly fractured today population of dugong are found in the water of country and territory recorded number of dugong are generally believed to be lower than actual number due to a lack of accurate survey despite this the dugong population is thought to be shrinking with a worldwide decline of percent in the last year they have disappeared from the water of hong kong mauritius and taiwan a well a part of cambodia japan the philippine and vietnam further disappearance are likelydugongs are generally found in warm water around the coast with large number concentrated in wide and shallow protected bay the dugong is the only strictly marine herbivorous mammal a all specie of manatee utilise fresh water to some degree nonetheless they can tolerate the brackish water found in coastal wetland and large number are also found in wide and shallow mangrove channel and around leeward side of large inshore island where seagrass bed are common they are usually located at a depth of around m ft although in area where the continental shelf remains shallow dugong have been known to travel more than kilometre mi from the shore descending to a far a metre ft where deepwater seagrass such a halophila spinulosa are found special habitat are used for different activity it ha been observed that shallow water are used a site for calving minimizing the risk of predation deep water may provide a thermal refuge from cooler water closer to the shore during winter australia australia is home to the largest population stretching from shark bay in western australia to moreton bay in queensland the population of shark bay is thought to be stable with over dugong smaller population exist up the coast including one in ashmore reef large number of dugong live to the north of the northern territory with a population of over in the gulf of carpentaria alone a population of over exists in the torres strait such a off thursday island although there is significant migration between the strait and the water of new guinea the great barrier reef provides important feeding area for the specie this reef area house a stable population of around although the population concentration ha shifted over time large bay facing north on the queensland coast provide significant habitat for dugong with the southernmost of these being hervey bay and moreton bay dugong had been occasional visitor along the gold coast where a of a local population through range expansion ha started recently persian gulf the persian gulf ha the dugong population in the world inhabiting most of the southern coast and the current population is believed to range from to in the course of a study being carried out in and on the persian gulf the largest reported group sighting wa made of more than individual to the west of qatar however recent study revealed severe decline both in population size and distribution among the region a study for instance found a nearly drop in population since reason for this drastic population loss include illegal poaching oil spill and net entanglement east africa and south asia in the late herd of up to dugong were observed off the coast of east africa and nearby island current population in this area are extremely small numbering and below and it is thought likely they will become extinct the eastern side of the red sea is home to large population numbering in the hundred and similar population are thought to exist on the western side in the it wa estimated there could be a many a dugong in the red sea dugong population in madagascar are poorly studied but due to widespread exploitation it is thought they may have severely declined with few surviving individual in mozambique most of the remaining local population are very small and the largest about individual occurs at bazaruto island but they have become rare in historical habitat such a in maputo bay and on inhaca island in tanzania observation have recently been increased around the mafia island marine park where a hunt wa intended by fisherman but failed in in the seychelles dugong had been regarded a extinct in century until a small number wa discovered around the aldabra atoll this population may belong to a different group than that distributed among the inner isle dugong once thrived among the chagos archipelago and sea cow island wa named after the specie although the specie no longer occurs in the regiona highly isolated breeding population exists in the marine national park gulf of kutch the only remaining population in western india it is kilometre mi from the population in the persian gulf and kilometre mi from the nearest population in india former population in this area centered on the maldives and the laccadive island are presumed to be extinct a population exists in the gulf of mannar marine national park and the palk strait between india and sri lanka but it is seriously depleted recovery of seagrass bed along former range of dugong such a the chilika lake have been confirmed in recent year raising hope for of the specie the population around the andaman and nicobar island are known only from a few record and although the population wa large during british rule it is now believed to be small and scattered once distributed throughout the coastal belt in sri lanka the dugong number have declined in last two decade southern pacific outside of australia a small population exists today along the southern coast of china where effort are being made to protect it including the establishment of a seagrass sanctuary for dugong and other endangered marine fauna ranging in guangxi despite these effort number continue to decrease and in it wa reported that no more dugong could be found on the west coast of the island of hainan historically dugong were also present in the southern part of the yellow seain vietnam dugong have been restricted mostly to the province of kien giang and ba tau including phu quoc island and con dao island which hosted large population in the past con dao is now the only site in vietnam where dugong are regularly seen protected within the con dao national park nonetheless dangerously low level of awareness for conservation of marine organism in vietnam and cambodia may result in increased intentional or unintentional catch and illegal trade is a potential danger for local dugong on phu quoc the first festival wa held in aiming to raise awareness of these issuesin thailand the present distribution of dugong is restricted to six province along the andaman sea and very few dugong are present in the gulf of thailand the gulf of thailand wa historically home to large number of the animal but none have been sighted in the west of the gulf in recent year and the remaining population in the east is thought to be very small and possibly declining dugong are believed to exist in the strait of johor in very small number the water around borneo support a small population with more scattered throughout the malay archipelagoall the island of the philippine once provided habitat for sizeable herd of dugong they were common until the when their number declined sharply due to accidental drownings in fishing gear and habitat destruction of seagrass meadow today only isolated population survive most notably in the water off the calamian island in palawan isabela in luzon guimaras and mindanao the dugong became the first marine animal protected by philippine law with harsh penalty for harming them recently local marine trash problem in the archipelago remained unabated and became the biggest threat to the already dwindling population of dugong in the country litter of plastic waste sachet plastic bottle jollibee container etc and other material abound in the coastal area a these material may be mistaken a food by dugong these may lead to death due to plastic ingestion overpopulation and lack of education of all coastal fisherfolk in the philippine regarding marine trash are clearly harming the coastal environment not only in palawan but also across the island of the philippinespopulations also exist around the solomon island archipelago and new caledonia stretching to an easternmost population in vanuatu a highly isolated population life around the island of palaua single dugong life at coco keeling island although the animal is thought to be a vagrant northern pacific today possibly the smallest and northernmost population of dugong exists around the ryukyu island and a population formerly existed off taiwan an endangered population of or fewer dugong possibly a few a three individual survives around okinawa new sighting of a pair have been reported in indicating a possible breeding had occurred in these water a single individual wa recorded at amami oshima at the northernmost edge of the dugong historic range more than year after the last previous recorded sighting a vagrant strayed into port near ushibuka kumamoto and died due to poor health historically the yaeyama island held a large concentration of dugong with more than individual on aragusuku island large quantity of skull are preserved at an utaki that outsider are strictly forbidden to enter dugong population in these area were reduced by historical hunt a payment to the ryukyu kingdom before being wiped out because of illegal hunting and fishing using destructive method such a dynamite fishing after the second world war population around taiwan appear to be almost extinct although remnant individual may visit area with rich seagrass bed such a dongsha atoll some of the last reported sighting were made in kenting national park in the and there had been occasional record of vagrant at the northern mariana island prior to it is unknown how much mixing there wa between these population historically some theorize that population existed independently for example that the okinawan population were isolated member derived from the migration of a philippine subspecies others postulate that the population formed part of a where migration between ryukyu taiwan and the philippine wa common extinct mediterranean population it ha been confirmed that dugong once inhabited the water of the mediterranean possibly until after the rise of civilization along the inland sea this population possibly shared ancestry with the red sea population and the mediterranean population had never been large due to geographical factor and climate change the mediterranean is the region where the dugongidae originated in the eocene along with caribbean sea ecology and life history dugong are and the oldest recorded specimen reached age they have few natural predator although animal such a crocodile killer whale and shark pose a threat to the young and a dugong ha also been recorded to have died from trauma after being impaled by a stingray barb a large number of infection and parasitic disease affect dugong detected pathogen include helminth cryptosporidium different type of bacterial infection and other unidentified parasite of dugong death in queensland since are thought to be because of diseasealthough they are social animal they are usually solitary or found in pair due to the inability of seagrass bed to support large population gathering of hundred of dugong sometimes happen but they last only for a short time because they are shy and do not approach human little is known about dugong behavior they can go six minute without breathing though about two and a half minute is more typical and have been known to rest on their tail to breathe with their head above water they can dive to a maximum depth of metre ft they spend most of their life no deeper than metre ft communication between individual is through chirp whistle bark and other sound that echo underwater different sound have been observed with different amplitude and frequency implying different purpose visual communication is limited due to poor eyesight and is mainly used for activity such a lekking for courtship purpose mother and calf are in almost constant physical contact and calf have been known to reach out and touch their mother with their flipper for reassurancedugongs are often traveling long distance in search of food but staying within a certain range their entire life large number often move together from one area to another it is thought that these movement are caused by change in seagrass availability their memory allows them to return to specific point after long travel dugong movement mostly occur within a localized area of seagrass bed and animal in the same region show individualistic pattern of movement daily movement is affected by the tide in area where there is a large tidal range dugong travel with the tide in order to access shallower feeding area in moreton bay dugong often travel between foraging ground inside the bay and warmer oceanic water at higher latitude dugong make seasonal travel to reach warmer water during the winter occasionally individual dugong make travel over many day and can travel over deep ocean water one animal wa seen a far south a sydney although they are marine creature dugong have been known to travel up creek and in one case a dugong wa caught kilometre mi up a creek near cooktown feeding dugong along with other sirenian are referred to a sea cow because their diet consists mainly of when eating they ingest the whole plant including the root although when this is impossible they will feed on just the leaf a wide variety of seagrass ha been found in dugong stomach content and evidence exists they will eat algae when seagrass is scarce although almost completely herbivorous they will occasionally eat invertebrate such a jellyfish sea squirt and shellfish dugong in moreton bay australia are omnivorous feeding on invertebrate such a polychaete or marine algae when the supply of their choice grass decrease in other southern area of both western and eastern australia there is evidence that dugong actively seek out large invertebrate this doe not apply to dugong in tropical area in which fecal evidence indicates that invertebrate are not eatenmost dugong do not feed on lush area but where the seagrass is more sparse additional factor such a protein concentration and regenerative ability also affect the value of a seagrass bed the chemical structure and composition of the seagrass is important and the grass specie most often eaten are low in fiber high in nitrogen and easily digestible in the great barrier reef dugong feed on seagrass such a halophila and halodule so a to maximize nutrient intake instead of bulk eating seagrass of a lower seral are preferred where the area ha not fully vegetated only certain seagrass meadow are suitable for dugong consumption due to the dugong highly specialized diet there is evidence that dugong actively alter seagrass specie composition at local level dugong may search out deeper seagrass feeding trail have been observed a deep a metre ft and dugong have been seen feeding a deep a metre ft dugong are relatively swimming at around kilometre per hour mph when moving along the seabed to feed they walk on their pectoral finsdugong feeding may favor the subsequent growth seagrass such a halophilia and halodule specie such a zosteria capricorni are more dominant in established seagrass bed but grow slowly while halophilia and halodule grow quickly in the open space left by dugong feeding this behavior is known a cultivation grazing and favor the rapidly growing higher nutrient seagrass that dugong prefer dugong may also prefer to feed on younger le fibrous strand of seagrass and cycle of cultivation feeding at different seagrass meadow may provide them with a greater number of younger plant due to their poor eyesight dugong often use smell to locate edible plant they also have a strong tactile sense and feel their surroundings with their long sensitive bristle they will dig up an entire plant and then shake it to remove the sand before eating it they have been known to collect a pile of plant in one area before eating them the flexible and muscular upper lip is used to dig out the plant this leaf furrow in the sand in their path reproduction and parental care a dugong reach sexual maturity between the age of eight and eighteen older than in most other mammal the way that female know how a male ha reached sexual maturity is by the eruption of tusk in the male since tusk erupt in male when testosterone level reach a high enough level the age when a female first give birth is disputed with some study placing the age between ten and seventeen year while others place it a early a six year there is evidence that male dugong lose fertility at older age despite the longevity of the dugong which may live for year or more female give birth only a few time during their life and invest considerable parental care in their young the time between birth is unclear with estimate ranging from to yearsmating behaviour varies between population located in different area in some population male will establish a territory which female in estrus will visit in these area a male will try to impress the female while defending the area from other male a practice known a lekking in other area many male will attempt to mate with the same female sometimes inflicting injury to the female or each other during this the female will have copulated with multiple male who will have fought to mount her from below this greatly increase the chance of conceptionfemales give birth after a month gestation usually to just one calf birth occurs in very shallow water with occasion known where the mother were almost on the shore a soon a the young is born the mother push it to the surface to take a breath newborn are already metre ft long and weigh around kilogram lb once born they stay close to their mother possibly to make swimming easier the calf nurse for month although it begin to eat seagrass soon after birth a calf will only leave it mother once it ha matured when need to be nursed calf would suck their flipper in a sucking fashion a observed in calf under human care importance to human dugong have historically provided easy target for hunter who killed them for their meat oil skin and bone a the anthropologist a asbjorn jon ha noted they are often considered a the inspiration for mermaid and people around the world developed culture around dugong hunting in some area it remains an animal of great significance and a growing ecotourism industry around dugong ha had an economic benefit in some countriesthere is a wall painting of a dugong apparently drawn by neolithic people in tambun cave ipoh malaysia this wa discovered by lieutenant rl rawlings in while on a routine patrol during the renaissance and the baroque era dugong were often exhibited in wunderkammers they were also presented a fiji mermaid in sideshow dugong meat and oil have traditionally been some of the most valuable food of australian aborigine and torres strait islander some aborigine regard dugong a part of their aboriginality dugong have also played a role in legend in kenya and the animal is known there a the queen of the sea body part are used a food medicine and decoration in the gulf state dugong served not only a a source of food but their tusk were used a sword handle dugong oil is important a a preservative and conditioner for wooden boat to people around the gulf of kutch in india who also believe the meat to be an aphrodisiac dugong rib were used to make carving in japan in southern china dugong were traditionally regarded a a miraculous fish and it wa bad luck to catch them a wave of immigration beginning at the end of the resulted in dugong being hunted for food in the philippine dugong are thought to bring bad luck and part of them are used to ward against evil spirit in area of thailand it is believed that the dugong tear form a powerful love potion while in part of indonesia they are considered reincarnation of woman in papua new guinea they are seen a a symbol of strength conservation dugong number have decreased in recent time for a population to remain stable percent of adult must survive the span of one year the estimated percentage of female human can kill without depleting the population is this number is reduced in area where calving is minimal due to food shortage even in the best condition a population is unlikely to increase more than a year leaving dugong vulnerable to the fact that they live in shallow water put them under great pressure from human activity research on dugong and the effect of human activity on them ha been limited mostly taking place in australia in many country dugong number have never been surveyed a such trend are uncertain with more data needed for comprehensive management the only data stretching back far enough to mention population trend come from the urban coast of queensland australia the last major worldwide study made in concluded that the dugong wa declining and possibly extinct in a third of it range with unknown status in another halfthe iucn red list list the dugong a vulnerable and the convention on international trade in endangered specie of wild fauna and flora regulates and in some area ha banned international trade regional cooperation is important due to the widespread distribution of the animal and in there wa strong support for southeast asian cooperation to protect dugong kenya ha passed legislation banning the hunting of dugong and restricting trawling but the dugong is not yet listed under kenya wildlife act for endangered specie mozambique ha had legislation to protect dugong since but this ha not been effectively enforced many marine park have been established on the african coast of the red sea and the egyptian gulf of aqaba is fully protected the united arab emirate ha banned all hunting of dugong within it water a ha bahrain the uae ha additionally banned drift net fishing india and sri lanka ban the hunting and selling of dugong and their product japan ha listed dugong a endangered and ha banned intentional kill and harassment hunting catching and harassment are banned by the people republic of china the first marine mammal to be protected in the philippine wa the dugong although monitoring this is difficult palau ha legislated to protect dugong although this is not well enforced and poaching persists indonesia list dugong a a protected specie however protection is not always enforced and souvenir product made from dugong part can be openly found in market in bali the dugong is a national animal of papua new guinea which ban all except traditional hunting vanuatu and new caledonia ban hunting of dugong dugong are protected throughout australia although the rule vary by state in some area indigenous hunting is allowed dugong are listed under the nature conservation act in the australian state of queensland a vulnerable most currently live in established marine park where boat must travel at a restricted speed and mesh net fishing is restricted in vietnam an illegal network targeting dugong had been detected and wa shut down in potential hunt along tanzanian coast by fisherman have raised concern a well human activity despite being legally protected in many country the main cause of population decline remain anthropogenic and include hunting habitat degradation and fatality entanglement in fishing net ha caused many death although there are no precise statistic most issue with industrial fishing occur in deeper water where dugong population are low with local fishing being the main risk in shallower water a dugong can not stay underwater for a very long period they are highly prone to death due to entanglement the use of shark net ha historically caused large number of death and they have been eliminated in most area and replaced with baited hook hunting ha historically been a problem too although in most area they are no longer hunted with the exception of certain indigenous community in area such a northern australia hunting remains the greatest impact on the dugong populationvessel strike have proved a problem for manatee but the relevance of this to dugong is unknown increasing boat traffic ha increased danger especially in shallow water ecotourism ha increased in some country although the effect remain undocumented it ha been seen to cause issue in area such a hainan due to environmental degradation modern farming practice and increased land clearing have also had an impact and much of the coastline of dugong habitat are undergoing industrialization with increasing human population dugong accumulate heavy metal ion in their tissue throughout their life more so than other marine mammal the effect are unknown while international cooperation to form a conservative unit ha been undertaken need are an impediment to dugong conservation in many developing country the shallow water are often used a a source of food and income problem exacerbated by aid used to improve fishing in many country the legislation doe not exist to protect dugong and if it doe it is not enforcedoil spill are a danger to dugong in some area a is land reclamation in okinawa the small dugong population is threatened by united state military activity plan exist to build a military base close to the henoko reef and military activity also add the threat of noise pollution chemical pollution soil erosion and exposure to depleted uranium the military base plan have been fought in u court by some okinawans whose concern include the impact on the local environment and dugong habitat it wa later revealed that the government of japan wa hiding evidence of the negative effect of ship lane and human activity on dugong observed during survey carried out off henoko reef one of the three individual ha not been observed since june corresponding to the start of the excavation operation environmental degradation if dugong do not get enough to eat they may calve later and produce fewer young food shortage can be caused by many factor such a a loss of habitat death and decline in quality of seagrass and a disturbance of feeding caused by human activity sewage detergent heavy metal hypersaline water herbicide and other waste product all negatively affect seagrass meadow human activity such a mining trawling dredging land reclamation and boat propeller scarring also cause an increase in sedimentation which smother seagrass and prevents light from reaching it this is the most significant negative factor affecting seagrasshalophila of the dugong preferred specie of rapidly due to lack of light dying completely after day extreme weather such a cyclone and flood can destroy hundred of square kilometer of seagrass meadow a well a washing dugong ashore the recovery of seagrass meadow and the spread of seagrass into new area or area where it ha been destroyed can take over a decade most measure for protection involve restricting activity such a trawling in area containing seagrass meadow with little to no action on pollutant originating from land in some area water salinity is increased due to wastewater and it is unknown how much salinity seagrass can withstanddugong habitat in the oura bay area of henoko okinawa japan is currently under threat from land reclamation conducted by japanese government in order to build a u marine base in the area in august preliminary drilling survey were conducted around the seagrass bed there the construction is expected to seriously damage the dugong population habitat possibly leading to local extinction capture and captivity the australian state of queensland ha sixteen dugong protection park and some preservation zone have been established where even aboriginal people are not allowed to hunt capturing animal for research ha caused only one or two death dugong are expensive to keep in captivity due to the long time mother and calf spend together and the inability to grow the seagrass that dugong eat in an aquarium only one orphaned calf ha ever been successfully kept in captivityworldwide only three dugong are held in captivity a female from the philippine life at toba aquarium in toba mie japan a male also lived there until he died on february the second resides in sea world indonesia after having been rescued from a fisherman net and treated the last one a male is kept at sydney aquarium where he ha resided since he wa a juvenile sydney aquarium had a second dugong for many year until she died in a captive dugong at underwater world singapore wa reported to have died in at the age of from complication arising from an acute digestive disorder reference
