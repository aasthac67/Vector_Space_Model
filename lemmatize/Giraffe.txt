the giraffe giraffa is an african artiodactyl mammal the tallest living terrestrial animal and the largest ruminant it is traditionally considered to be one specie giraffa camelopardalis with nine subspecies however the existence of up to eight extant giraffe specie ha been described based upon research into the mitochondrial and nuclear dna a well a morphological measurement of giraffa seven other specie are extinct prehistoric specie known from fossil the giraffe chief distinguishing characteristic are it extremely long neck and leg it ossicones and it distinctive coat pattern it is classified under the family giraffidae along with it closest extant relative the okapi it scattered range extends from chad in the north to south africa in the south and from niger in the west to somalia in the east giraffe usually inhabit savannah and woodland their food source is leaf fruit and flower of woody plant primarily acacia specie which they browse at height most other herbivore can not reach giraffe may be preyed on by lion leopard spotted hyena and african wild dog giraffe live in herd of related female and their offspring or bachelor herd of unrelated adult male but are gregarious and may gather in large aggregation male establish social hierarchy through necking which are combat bout where the neck is used a a weapon dominant male gain mating access to female which bear the sole responsibility for raising the young the giraffe ha intrigued various culture both ancient and modern for it peculiar appearance and ha often been featured in painting book and cartoon it is classified by the international union for conservation of nature a vulnerable to extinction and ha been extirpated from many part of it former range giraffe are still found in numerous national park and game reserve but estimate a of indicate that there are approximately member of giraffa in the wild more than were kept in zoo in etymology the name giraffe ha it earliest known origin in the arabic word zarafah zrf@ perhaps borrowed from the animal somali name geri the arab name is translated a there were several middle english spelling such a jarraf ziraph and gerfauntz the italian form giraffa arose in the the modern english form developed around from the french girafe camelopard is an archaic english name for the giraffe deriving from the ancient greek for camel and leopard referring to it shape and it colouring taxonomy living giraffe were originally classified a one specie by carl linnaeus in he gave it the binomial name cervus camelopardalis morten thrane brunnich classified the genus giraffa in the specie name camelopardalis is from latin evolution the giraffe is one of only two living genus of the family giraffidae in the order artiodactyla the other being the okapi the family wa once much more extensive with over fossil genus described their closest known relative may have been the extinct climacocerids they together with the family antilocapridae whose only extant specie is the pronghorn have been placed in the superfamily giraffoidea these animal may have evolved from the extinct family palaeomerycidae which might also have been the ancestor of deerthe elongation of the neck appears to have started early in the giraffe lineage comparison between giraffe and their ancient relative suggest that vertebra close to the skull lengthened earlier followed by lengthening of vertebra further down one early giraffid ancestor wa canthumeryx which ha been dated variously to have lived million year ago mya mya or mya and whose deposit have been found in libya this animal wa slender and giraffokeryx appeared mya in the indian subcontinent and resembled an okapi or a small giraffe and had a longer neck and similar ossicones giraffokeryx may have shared a clade with more massively built giraffids like sivatherium and bramatherium giraffids like palaeotragus shansitherium and samotherium appeared mya and lived throughout africa and eurasia these animal had bare ossicones and small cranial sinus and were longer with broader skull paleotragus resembled the okapi and may have been it ancestor others find that the okapi lineage diverged earlier before giraffokeryx samotherium wa a particularly important transitional fossil in the giraffe lineage a it cervical vertebra wa intermediate in length and structure between a modern giraffe and an okapi and wa more vertical than the okapi bohlinia which first appeared in southeastern europe and lived mya wa likely a direct ancestor of the giraffe bohlinia closely resembled modern giraffe having a long neck and leg and similar ossicones and dentitionbohlinia entered china and northern india in response to climate change from there the genus giraffa evolved and around mya entered africa further climate change caused the extinction of the asian giraffe while the african giraffe survived and radiated into several new specie living giraffe appear to have arisen around mya in eastern africa during the pleistocene some biologist suggest the modern giraffe descended from g jumae others find g gracilis a more likely candidate g jumae wa larger and more heavily built while g gracilis wa smaller and more lightly built the main driver for the evolution of the giraffe is believed to have been the change from extensive forest to more open habitat which began mya during this time tropical plant disappeared and were replaced by arid plant and a dry savannah emerged across eastern and northern africa and western india some researcher have hypothesised that this new habitat coupled with a different diet including acacia specie may have exposed giraffe ancestor to toxin that caused higher mutation rate and a higher rate of evolution the coat pattern of modern giraffe may also have coincided with these habitat change asian giraffe are hypothesised to have had more colourationsthe giraffe genome is around billion base pair in length compared to the billion base pair of the okapi of the protein in giraffe and okapi gene are identical the two specie are equally distantly related to cattle suggesting the giraffe unique characteristic are not because of faster evolution the divergence of giraffe and okapi lineage date to around mya a small group of regulatory gene in the giraffe appear to be responsible for the animal stature and associated circulatory adaptation specie and subspecies the iucn currently recognises only one specie of giraffe with nine subspecies in a taxonomy wa proposed a study on the genetics of giraffe suggested they were six specie the west african rothschild reticulated masai angolan and south african giraffe the study deduced from genetic difference in nuclear and mitochondrial dna mtdna that giraffe from these population are reproductively isolated and rarely interbreed though no natural obstacle block their mutual access this includes adjacent population of rothschild reticulated and masai giraffe the masai giraffe wa also suggested to consist of possibly two specie separated by the rift valley reticulated and masai giraffe were found to have the highest mtdna diversity which is consistent with giraffe originating in eastern africa population further north are more closely related to the former while those to the south are more related to the latter giraffe appear to select mate of the same coat type which are imprinted on them a calvesa study using detailed analysis of the morphology of giraffe and application of the phylogenetic specie concept described eight specie of living giraffe a study also concluded that living giraffe consist of multiple specie the researcher suggested the existence of four specie which have not exchanged genetic information between each other for to million year since then a response to this publication ha been published highlighting seven problem in data interpretation and concludes the conclusion should not be accepted unconditionally a study showed that depending on the method chosen different taxonomic hypothesis recognizing from two to six specie can be considered for the genus giraffa that study also found that multi specie coalescent method can lead to taxonomic a those method delimit geographic structure rather than specie the hypothesis which recognises g camelopardalis g giraffa and g tippelskirchi is highly supported by phylogenetic analysis and also corroborated by most population genetic and multi specie coalescent analysesthere are also seven extinct specie of giraffe listed a the following gracilis jumae priscilla punjabiensis pygmaea sivalensis stilleig attica also extinct wa formerly considered part of giraffa but wa reclassified a bohlinia attica in appearance and anatomy fully grown giraffe stand m ft tall with male taller than female the tallest recorded male wa m ft and the tallest recorded female wa m ft tall the average weight is kg lb for an adult male and kg lb for an adult female with maximum weight of kg lb and kg lb having been recorded for male and female respectively despite it long neck and leg the giraffe body is relatively short located at both side of the head the giraffe large bulging eye give it good vision from it great height giraffe see in colour and their sens of hearing and smell are also sharp the animal can close it muscular nostril to protect against sandstorm and antsthe giraffe prehensile tongue is about cm in long it is in colour perhaps to protect against sunburn and is useful for grasping foliage a well a for grooming and cleaning the animal nose the upper lip of the giraffe is also prehensile and useful when foraging and is covered in hair to protect against thorn the tongue and inside of the mouth are covered in papillaethe coat ha dark blotch or patch which can be orange chestnut brown or nearly black in colour separated by light hair usually white or cream in colour male giraffe become darker a they age the coat pattern ha been claimed to serve a camouflage in the light and shade pattern of savannah woodland when standing among tree and bush they are hard to see at even a few metre distance however adult giraffe move about to gain the best view of an approaching predator relying on their size and ability to defend themselves rather than on camouflage which may be more important for calf each individual giraffe ha a unique coat pattern giraffe calf inherit some coat pattern trait from their mother and variation in some spot trait are correlated with neonatal survival the skin underneath the blotch may serve a window for thermoregulation being site for complex blood vessel system and large sweat glandsthe skin of a giraffe is mostly gray or tan it thickness allows the animal to run through thorn bush without being punctured the fur may serve a a chemical defence a it parasite repellent give the animal a characteristic scent at least main aromatic chemical are in the fur although indole and are responsible for most of the smell because the male have a stronger odour than the female the odour may also have sexual function along the animal neck is a mane made of short erect hair the tail end in a long dark tuft of hair and is used a a defense against insect skull and ossicones both sex have prominent structure called ossicones which are formed from ossified cartilage covered in skin and fused to the skull at the parietal bone being vascularized the ossicones may have a role in thermoregulation and are also used in combat between male appearance is a reliable guide to the sex or age of a giraffe the ossicones of female and young are thin and display tuft of hair on top whereas those of adult male end in knob and tend to be bald on top also a median lump which is more prominent in male emerges at the front of the skull male develop calcium deposit that form bump on their skull a they age a giraffe skull is lightened by multiple sinus however a male age their skull become heavier and more helping them become more dominant in combat the upper jaw ha a grooved palate and lack front teeth the giraffe molar have a rough surface leg locomotion and posture the front and back leg of a giraffe are about the same length the radius and ulna of the front leg are articulated by the carpus which while structurally equivalent to the human wrist function a a knee it appears that a suspensory ligament allows the lanky leg to support the animal great weight the foot of the giraffe reach a diameter of cm in and the hoof is cm in high in male and cm in in female the rear of each hoof is low and the fetlock is close to the ground allowing the foot to provide additional support to the animal weight giraffe lack dewclaws and interdigital gland the giraffe pelvis though relatively short ha an ilium that is outspread at the upper endsa giraffe ha only two gait walking and galloping walking is done by moving the leg on one side of the body at the same time then doing the same on the other side when galloping the hind leg move around the front leg before the latter move forward and the tail will curl up the animal relies on the forward and backward motion of it head and neck to maintain balance and the counter momentum while galloping the giraffe can reach a sprint speed of up to mph and can sustain mph for several kilometresa giraffe rest by lying with it body on top of it folded leg to lie down the animal kneel on it front leg and then lower the rest of it body to get back up it first get on it knee and spread it hind leg to raise it hindquarter it then straightens it front leg with each step the animal swing it head in captivity the giraffe sleep intermittently around hour per day mostly at night it usually sleep lying down however standing sleep have been recorded particularly in older individual intermittent short deep sleep phase while lying are characterised by the giraffe bending it neck backwards and resting it head on the hip or thigh a position believed to indicate paradoxical sleep if the giraffe want to bend down to drink it either spread it front leg or bend it knee giraffe would probably not be competent swimmer a their long leg would be highly cumbersome in the water although they could possibly float when swimming the thorax would be weighed down by the front leg making it difficult for the animal to move it neck and leg in harmony or keep it head above the surface neck the giraffe ha an extremely elongated neck which can be up to m ft in length accounting for much of the animal vertical height the long neck result from a disproportionate lengthening of the cervical vertebra not from the addition of more vertebra each cervical vertebra is over cm in long they comprise per cent of the length of the giraffe vertebral column compared with the percent typical of similar large ungulate including the giraffe closest living relative the okapi this elongation largely take place after birth perhaps because giraffe mother would have a difficult time giving birth to young with the same neck proportion a adult the giraffe head and neck are held up by large muscle and a strengthened nuchal ligament which are anchored by long dorsal spine on the anterior thoracic vertebra giving the animal a hump the giraffe neck vertebra have ball and socket joint in particular the joint and allows the animal to tilt it head vertically and reach more branch with the tongue the point of articulation between the cervical and thoracic vertebra of giraffe is shifted to lie between the first and second thoracic vertebra and unlike most other ruminant where the articulation is between the seventh cervical vertebra and this allows to contribute directly to increased neck length and ha given rise to the suggestion that is actually and that giraffe have added an extra cervical vertebra however this proposition is not generally accepted a ha other morphological feature such a an articulating rib deemed diagnostic of thoracic vertebra and because exception to the mammalian limit of seven cervical vertebra are generally characterised by increased neurological anomaly and maladiesthere are several hypothesis regarding the evolutionary origin and maintenance of elongation in giraffe neck the competing browser hypothesis wa originally suggested by charles darwin and challenged only recently it suggests that competitive pressure from smaller browser such a kudu steenbok and impala encouraged the elongation of the neck a it enabled giraffe to reach food that competitor could not this advantage is real a giraffe can and do feed up to m ft high while even quite large competitor such a kudu can feed up to only about m ft in high there is also research suggesting that browsing competition is intense at lower level and giraffe feed more efficiently gaining more leaf biomass with each mouthful high in the canopy however scientist disagree about just how much time giraffe spend feeding at level beyond the reach of other browser and a study found that adult giraffe with longer neck actually suffered higher mortality rate under drought condition than their counterpart this study suggests that maintaining a longer neck requires more nutrient which put giraffe at risk during a food shortageanother theory the sexual selection hypothesis proposes that the long neck evolved a a secondary sexual characteristic giving male an advantage in necking contest see below to establish dominance and obtain access to sexually receptive female in support of this theory neck are longer and heavier for male than female of the same age and the former do not employ other form of combat however one objection is that it fails to explain why female giraffe also have long neck it ha also been proposed that the neck serf to give the animal greater vigilance internal system in mammal the left recurrent laryngeal nerve is longer than the right in the giraffe it is over cm in longer these nerve are longer in the giraffe than in any other living animal the left nerve is over m ft in long each nerve cell in this path begin in the brainstem and pass down the neck along the vagus nerve then branch off into the recurrent laryngeal nerve which pass back up the neck to the larynx thus these nerve cell have a length of nearly m ft in the largest giraffe the structure of a giraffe brain resembles that of domestic cattle it is kept cool by evaporative heat loss in the nasal passage the shape of the skeleton give the giraffe a small lung volume relative to it mass it long neck give it a large amount of dead space in spite of it narrow windpipe these factor increase the resistance to airflow nevertheless the animal can still supply enough oxygen to it tissue and it can increase it respiratory rate and oxygen diffusion when running the circulatory system of the giraffe ha several adaptation for it great height it heart which can weigh more than kg lb and measure about cm ft long must generate approximately double the blood pressure required for a human to maintain blood flow to the brain a such the wall of the heart can be a thick a cm in giraffe have unusually high heart rate for their size at beat per minute when the animal lower it head the blood rush down fairly unopposed and a rete mirabile in the upper neck with it large cross sectional area prevents excess blood flow to the brain when it raise again the blood vessel constrict and direct blood into the brain so the animal doe not faint the jugular vein contain several most commonly seven valve to prevent blood flowing back into the head from the inferior vena cava and right atrium while the head is lowered conversely the blood vessel in the lower leg are under great pressure because of the weight of fluid pressing down on them to solve this problem the skin of the lower leg is thick and tight preventing too much blood from pouring into themgiraffes have oesophageal muscle that are unusually strong to allow regurgitation of food from the stomach up the neck and into the mouth for rumination they have four chambered stomach a in all ruminant and the first chamber ha adapted to their specialized diet the intestine of an adult giraffe measure more than m ft in length and have a relatively small ratio of small to large intestine the liver of the giraffe is small and compact a gallbladder is generally present during fetal life but it may disappear before birth behaviour and ecology habitat and feeding giraffe usually inhabit savannah and open woodland they prefer acacieae commiphora combretum and open terminalia woodland over denser environment like brachystegia woodland the angolan giraffe can be found in desert environment giraffe browse on the twig of tree preferring tree of the subfamily acacieae and the genus commiphora and terminalia which are important source of calcium and protein to sustain the giraffe growth rate they also feed on shrub grass and fruit a giraffe eats around kg lb of foliage daily when stressed giraffe may chew the bark off branch although herbivorous the giraffe ha been known to visit carcass and lick dried meat off bonesduring the wet season food is abundant and giraffe are more spread out while during the dry season they gather around the remaining evergreen tree and bush mother tend to feed in open area presumably to make it easier to detect predator although this may reduce their feeding efficiency a a ruminant the giraffe first chew it food then swallow it for processing and then visibly pass the cud up the neck and back into the mouth to chew again it is common for a giraffe to salivate while feeding the giraffe requires le food than many other herbivore because the foliage it eats ha more concentrated nutrient and it ha a more efficient digestive system the animal faeces come in the form of small pellet when it ha access to water a giraffe drink at interval no longer than three daysgiraffes have a great effect on the tree that they feed on delaying the growth of young tree for some year and giving waistline to tree that are too tall feeding is at it highest during the first and last hour of daytime between these hour giraffe mostly stand and ruminate rumination is the dominant activity during the night when it is mostly done lying down social life giraffe are usually found in group that vary in size and composition according to ecological anthropogenic temporal and social factor traditionally the composition of these group had been described a open and for research purpose a group ha been defined a a collection of individual that are le than a kilometre apart and moving in the same general direction more recent study have found that giraffe have social association and may form group or pair based on kinship sex or other factor these group may regularly associate with one another in larger community or within a society the number of giraffe in a group can range up to individual giraffe group tend to be although group made of adult female and young male are known to occur particularly stable giraffe group are those made of mother and their young which can last week or month social cohesion in these group is maintained by the bond formed between calf female association appears to be based on and individual may be matrilineally related in general female are more selective than male in who they associate with in regard to individual of the same sex young male also form group and will engage in playfights however a they get older male become more solitary but may also associate in pair or with female group giraffe are not territorial but they have home range that vary according to rainfall and proximity to human settlement male giraffe occasionally wander far from area that they normally frequentalthough generally quiet and giraffe have been heard to communicate using various sound during courtship male emit loud cough female call their young by bellowing calf will emit snort bleat mooing and mewing sound giraffe also snore hiss moan grunt and make sound during nighttime giraffe appear to hum to each other above the infrasound range for purpose which are unclear reproduction and parental care reproduction in giraffe is broadly polygamous a few older male mate with the fertile female male giraffe ass female fertility by tasting the female urine to detect oestrus in a process known a the flehmen response male prefer young adult female over juvenile and older adult once an oestrous female is detected the male will attempt to court her when courting dominant male will keep subordinate one at bay a courting male may lick a female tail rest his head and neck on her body or nudge her with his horn during copulation the male stand on his hind leg with his head held up and his front leg resting on the female sidesgiraffe gestation last day after which a single calf is normally born although twin occur on rare occasion the mother give birth standing up the calf emerges head and front leg first having broken through the fetal membrane and fall to the ground severing the umbilical cord the mother then groom the newborn and help it stand up a newborn giraffe is m ft tall within a few hour of birth the calf can run around and is almost indistinguishable from a however for the first week it spends most of it time hiding it coat pattern providing camouflage the ossicones which have lain flat while it wa in the womb become erect within a few day mother with calf will gather in nursery herd moving or browsing together mother in such a group may sometimes leave their calf with one female while they forage and drink elsewhere this is known a a calving pool adult male play almost no role in raising the young although they appear to have friendly interaction calf are at risk of predation and a mother giraffe will stand over her calf and kick at an approaching predator female watching calving pool will only alert their own young if they detect a disturbance although the others will take notice and followthe length time in which offspring stay with their mother varies though it can last until the female next calving likewise calf may suckle for only a month or a long a a year female become sexually mature when they are four year old while male become mature at four or five year spermatogenesis in male giraffe begin at three to four year of age male must wait until they are at least seven year old to gain the opportunity to mate necking male giraffe use their neck a weapon in combat a behaviour known a necking necking is used to establish dominance and male that win necking bout have greater reproductive success this behaviour occurs at low or high intensity in low intensity necking the combatant rub and lean against each other the male that can hold itself more erect win the bout in high intensity necking the combatant will spread their front leg and swing their neck at each other attempting to land blow with their ossicones the contestant will try to dodge each other blow and then get ready to counter the power of a blow depends on the weight of the skull and the arc of the swing a necking duel can last more than half an hour depending on how well matched the combatant are although most fight do not lead to serious injury there have been record of broken jaw broken neck and even deathsafter a duel it is common for two male giraffe to caress and court each other such interaction between male have been found to be more frequent than heterosexual coupling in one study up to percent of observed mounting incident took place between male the proportion of activity varied from percent only one percent of mounting incident occurred between female mortality and health giraffe have high adult survival probability and an unusually long lifespan compared to other ruminant up to year because of their size eyesight and powerful kick adult giraffe are usually not subject to predation although lion may regularly prey on individual up to kg lb giraffe are the most common food source for the big cat in kruger national park comprising nearly a third of the meat consumed although only a small portion of the giraffe were probably killed by predator a a majority of the consumed giraffe appeared to be scavenged nile crocodile can also be a threat to giraffe when they bend down to drink calf are much more vulnerable than adult and are additionally preyed on by leopard spotted hyena and wild dog a quarter to a half of giraffe calf reach adulthood calf survival varies according to the season of birth with calf born during the dry season having higher survival ratesthe local seasonal presence of large herd of migratory wildebeest and zebra reduces predation pressure on giraffe calf and increase their survival probability in turn it ha been suggested that other ungulate may benefit from associating with giraffe a their height allows them to spot predator from further away zebra were found to glean information on predation risk from giraffe body language and spend le time scanning the environment when giraffe are presentsome parasite feed on giraffe they are often host for tick especially in the area around the genitals which ha thinner skin than other area tick specie that commonly feed on giraffe are those of genus hyalomma amblyomma and rhipicephalus giraffe may rely on and oxpeckers to clean them of tick and alert them to danger giraffe host numerous specie of internal parasite and are susceptible to various disease they were victim of the now eradicated viral illness rinderpest giraffe can also suffer from a skin disorder which come in the form of wrinkle lesion or raw fissure in tanzania it appears to be caused by a nematode and may be further affected by secondary infection a much a of giraffe show sign of the disease in ruaha national park but it did not cause mortality in tarangire and is le prevalent in area with fertile soil relationship with human human have interacted with giraffe for millennium they were depicted in art throughout the african continent including that of the kiffians egyptian and kushites the kiffians were responsible for a rock engraving of two giraffe dated year ago that ha been called the world largest rock art petroglyph the san people of southern africa have medicine dance named after some animal the giraffe dance is performed to treat head ailment how the giraffe got it height ha been the subject of various african folktale including one from eastern africa which explains that the giraffe grew tall from eating too many magic herb according to a tale in tanzania the giraffe wa given both it height and silence when it asked the creator for the gift of wisdom it could now see and hear all but it could not speak a silence is wisdom the dinka people of the sudan have traditionally considered the giraffe to be their clan animal and the earthly representative of their deity the tugen people of modern kenya used the giraffe to depict their god mda the egyptian gave the giraffe it own hieroglyph named in old egyptian and in later period they also kept giraffe a pet and shipped them around the mediterranean the giraffe wa also known to the greek and roman who believed that it wa an unnatural hybrid of a camel and a leopard or a panther and called it camelopardalis the giraffe wa among the many animal collected and displayed by the roman the first one in rome wa brought in by julius caesar in bc and exhibited to the public with the fall of the western roman empire the housing of giraffe in europe declined during the middle age giraffe were known to european through contact with the arab who revered the giraffe for it peculiar appearanceindividual captive giraffe were given celebrity status throughout history in a giraffe wa shipped from malindi to bengal it wa then taken to china by explorer zheng he and placed in a ming dynasty zoo the animal wa a source of fascination for the chinese people who associated it with the mythical qilin the medici giraffe wa a giraffe presented to lorenzo de medici in it caused a great stir on it arrival in florence zarafa another famous giraffe wa brought from egypt to paris in the early century a a gift from muhammad ali of egypt to charles x of france a sensation the giraffe wa the subject of numerous memorabilia or giraffanalia giraffe continue to have a presence in modern culture salvador dali depicted them with burning mane in some of his surrealist painting dali considered the giraffe to be a symbol of masculinity and a flaming giraffe wa meant to be a masculine cosmic apocalyptic monster several child book feature the giraffe including david a ufer the giraffe who wa afraid of height giles andreae giraffe ca dance and roald dahl the giraffe and the pelly and me giraffe have appeared in animated film a minor character in disney the lion king and dumbo and in more prominent role in the wild and in the madagascar film sophie the giraffe ha been a popular teether since another famous fictional giraffe is the toy r u mascot geoffrey the giraffe giraffe are used to represent innocence in the last of u video game seriesthe giraffe ha also been used for some scientific experiment and discovery scientist have looked at the property of giraffe skin when developing suit for astronaut and fighter pilot because the people in these profession are in danger of passing out if blood rush to their leg computer scientist have modeled the coat pattern of several subspecies using mechanismsthe constellation of camelopardalis introduced in the seventeenth century depicts a giraffe the tswana people of botswana traditionally see the constellation crux a two giraffe acrux and mimosa forming a male and gacrux and delta crucis forming the female exploitation and conservation status in giraffe were assessed a least concern from a conservation perspective by the international union for conservation of nature iucn but the assessment categorized giraffe a vulnerable giraffe have been extirpated from much of their historic range including eritrea guinea mauritania and senegal they may also have disappeared from angola mali and nigeria but have been introduced to rwanda and swaziland the masai and reticulated subspecies are endangered and the rothschild subspecies is near threatened the nubian subspecies is critically endangered in jonathan kingdon suggested that the nubian giraffe wa the most threatened of all giraffe a of it may number about individual private game reserve have contributed to the preservation of giraffe population in southern africa giraffe were probably common target for hunter throughout africa different part of their body were used for different purpose their meat wa used for food the tail hair served a flyswatter bracelet necklace and thread shield sandal and drum were made using the skin and the string of musical instrument were from the tendon the smoke from burning giraffe skin wa used by the medicine men of buganda to treat nose bleeds the humr people of kordofan consume the drink umm nyolokh which is prepared from the liver and bone marrow of giraffe richard rudgley hypothesised that umm nyolokh might contain dmt the drink is said to cause hallucination of giraffe believed to be the giraffe ghost by the humr in the century european explorer began to hunt them for sport habitat destruction ha hurt the giraffe too in the sahel the need for firewood and grazing room for livestock ha led to deforestation normally giraffe can coexist with livestock since they do not directly compete with them in severe drought in northern kenya have led to increased tension over land and the killing of wildlife by herder with giraffe population being particularly hitgiraffe manor is a popular hotel in nairobi that also serf a sanctuary for rothschild giraffe the giraffe is a protected specie in most of it range it is the national animal of tanzania and is protected by law unauthorised killing can result in imprisonment the un backed convention of migratory specie selected giraffe for protection in in it wa estimated that over giraffe existed in the wild but estimation a of indicate that there are approximately member of giraffa in the wild down from in a of there were more than in captivity at zoo not including zoo or any kept by private people aerial survey is the most common method of monitoring giraffe population trend in the vast roadless tract of african landscape but aerial method are known to undercount giraffe survey method are more accurate and can be used in conjunction with aerial survey to make accurate estimate of population size and trend reference external link giraffe african
