the dhole cuon alpinus is a canid native to central south east asia and southeast asia other english name for the specie include asian wild dog asiatic wild dog indian wild dog whistling dog red dog and mountain wolf it is genetically close to specie within the genus canis but distinct in several anatomical aspect it skull is convex rather than concave in profile it lack a third lower molar and the upper molar sport only a single cusp a opposed to between two and four during the pleistocene the dhole ranged throughout asia europe and north america but became restricted to it historical range year agothe dhole is a highly social animal living in large clan without rigid dominance hierarchy and containing multiple breeding female such clan usually consist of individual but group of over are known it is a diurnal pack hunter which preferentially target and ungulate in tropical forest the dhole competes with tiger and leopard targeting somewhat different prey specie but still with substantial dietary overlapit is listed a endangered by the iucn a population are decreasing and are estimated at fewer than adult factor contributing to this decline include habitat loss loss of prey competition with other specie persecution due to livestock predation and disease transfer from domestic dog etymology and naming the etymology of dhole is unclear the possible earliest written use of the word in english occurred in by soldier thomas williamson who encountered the animal in ramghur district he stated that dhole wa a common local name for the specie in charles hamilton smith claimed that it wa derived from a language spoken in part of the year later smith connected this word with turkish deli crazy and erroneously compared the turkish word with old saxon dol and dutch dol cfr also english dull german toll which are in fact from the dwalaz stupid richard lydekker wrote nearly year later that the word wa not used by the native living within the specie range the dictionary theorises that it may have come from the kannada tola taxonomy and evolution canis alpinus wa the binomial name proposed by peter simon pallas in who described it range a encompassing the upper level of udskoi ostrog in amurland towards the eastern side and in the region of the upper lena river around the yenisei river and occasionally crossing into china this northern russian range reported by pallas during the and century is considerably north of where this specie occurs todaycanis primaevus wa a name proposed by brian houghton hodgson in who thought that the dhole is a primitive canis form and the progenitor of the domestic dog hodgson later took note of the dhole physical distinctiveness from the genus canis and proposed the genus cuonthe first study on the origin of the specie wa conducted by paleontologist erich thenius who concluded that the dhole wa a descendant of a golden ancestor the earliest known member of the genus cuon is the chinese cuon majori of the villafranchian period it resembled canis in it physical form more than the modern specie which ha greatly reduced molar whose cusp have developed into sharply trenchant point by the middle pleistocene c majori had lost the last lower molar altogether c alpinus itself arose during the late middle pleistocene by which point the transformation of the lower molar into a single cusped slicing tooth had been completed late middle pleistocene dhole were virtually indistinguishable from their modern descendant save for their greater size which closely approached that of the gray wolf the dhole became extinct in much of europe during the late wurm period though it may have survived up until the early holocene in the iberian peninsula and at riparo fredian in northern italy the vast pleistocene range of this specie also included numerous island in asia that this specie no longer inhabits such a sri lanka borneo and possibly palawan in the philippine the fossil record indicates that the specie also occurred in north america with remains being found in beringia and mexicothe dhole distinctive morphology ha been a source of much confusion in determining the specie systematic position among the canidae george simpson placed the dhole in the subfamily simocyoninae alongside the african wild dog and the bush dog on account of all three specie similar dentition subsequent author including juliet noted greater morphological similarity to canid of the genus canis dusicyon and alopex than to either speothos or lycaon with any resemblance to the latter two being due to convergent evolutionsome author consider the extinct canis subgenus named xenocyon a ancestral to both the genus lycaon and the genus cuon subsequent study on the canid genome revealed that the dhole and african wild dog are closely related to member of the genus canis this closeness to canis may have been confirmed in a menagerie in madras where according to zoologist reginald pocock there is a record of a dhole interbred with a golden jackal admixture with the african wild dog in whole genome sequencing wa used to compare all member apart from the and jackal of the genus canis along with the dhole and the african wild dog lycaon pictus there wa strong evidence of ancient genetic admixture between the dhole and the african wild dog today their range are remote from each other however during the pleistocene era the dhole could be found a far west a europe the study proposes that the dhole distribution may have once included the middle east from where it may have admixed with the african wild dog in north africa however there is no evidence of the dhole having existed in the middle east nor north africa subspecies historically up to subspecies of dhole have been recognised a of seven subspecies are recognised by however study on the dhole mtdna and microsatellite genotype showed no clear subspecific distinction nevertheless two major phylogeographic grouping were discovered in dhole of the asian mainland which likely diverged during a glaciation event one population extends from south central and north india south of the ganges into myanmar and the other extends from india north of the ganges into northeastern india myanmar thailand and the malaysian peninsula the origin of dhole in sumatra and java is a of unclear a they show greater relatedness to dhole in india myanmar and china rather than with those in nearby malaysia in the absence of further data the researcher involved in the study speculated that javan and sumatran dhole could have been introduced to the island by human characteristic in appearance the dhole ha been variously described a combining the physical characteristic of the gray wolf and the red fox and a being on account of it long backbone and slender limb it ha a wide and massive skull with a sagittal crest and it masseter muscle are highly developed compared to other canid specie giving the face an almost appearance the rostrum is shorter than that of domestic dog and most other canid the specie ha six rather than seven lower molar the upper molar are weak being one third to one half the size of those of wolf and have only one cusp a opposed to between two and four a is usual in canid an adaptation thought to improve shearing ability thus allowing it to compete more successfully with kleptoparasites adult female can weigh from to kg to lb while the slightly larger male may weigh from to kg to lb the mean weight of adult from three small sample wa kg lb occasionally dhole may be sympatric with the indian wolf canis lupus pallipes which is one of the smallest race of the gray wolf but is still approximately heavier on average it stand to in to mm at the shoulder and measure ft m in body length it ear are somewhat rounded but le so than the african wild dog the general tone of the fur is reddish with the brightest hue occurring in winter in the winter coat the back is clothed in a saturated to reddish colour with brownish highlight along the top of the head neck and shoulder the throat chest flank and belly and the upper part of the limb are le brightly coloured and are more yellowish in tone the lower part of the limb are whitish with dark brownish band on the anterior side of the forelimb the muzzle and forehead are the tail is very luxuriant and fluffy and is mainly of a colour with a dark brown tip the summer coat is shorter coarser and darker the dorsal and lateral guard hair in adult measure mm in length dhole in the moscow zoo moult once a year from march to maydholes produce whistle resembling the call of red fox sometimes rendered a how this sound is produced is unknown though it is thought to help in coordinating the pack when travelling through thick brush when attacking prey they emit screaming kakakakaa sound other sound include whine food soliciting growl warning scream chattering both of which are alarm call and yapping cry in contrast to wolf dhole do not howl or bark dhole have a complex body language friendly or submissive greeting are accompanied by horizontal lip retraction and the lowering of the tail a well a licking playful dhole open their mouth with their lip retracted and their tail held in a vertical position whilst assuming a play bow aggressive or threatening dhole pucker their lip forward in a snarl and raise the hair on their back a well a keep their tail horizontal or vertical when afraid they pull their lip back horizontally with their tail tucked and their ear flat against the skull distribution and habitat the dhole still occurs in tibet and possibly also in north korea it once inhabited the alpine steppe extending into kashmir to the ladakh area but ha not been recorded in pakistan in central asia the dhole primarily inhabits mountainous area in the western part of it range it life mostly in alpine meadow and steppe high above sea level while in the east it mainly range in montane taigas and is sometimes sighted along coastline in india myanmar indochina indonesia and china it prefers forested area in alpine zone and occasionally also in plain regionsthe dhole might still be present in the tunkinsky national park in extreme southern siberia near lake baikal it possibly still life in the primorsky krai province in far eastern russia where it wa considered a rare and endangered specie in with unconfirmed report in the dom protected forest area no sighting wa reported in other area since the late currently no other recent report are confirmed of dhole being present in russiaone pack wa sighted in the qilian mountain in in to local government official and herder reported the presence of several dhole pack at elevation of to m to ft near taxkorgan nature reserve in the xinjiang autonomous region several pack and a female adult with pup were also recorded by camera trap at elevation of around to m to ft in yanchiwan national nature reserve in the northern gansu province in dhole have been also reported in the mountainsin china yunnan province dhole were recorded in baima xueshan nature reserve in dhole sample from wild animal were recently obtained in the jiangxi province in confirmed record by since have occurred in southern and western gansu province southern shaanxi province southern qinghai province southern and western yunnan province western sichuan province the southern xinjiang autonomous region and in the southeastern tibet autonomoous regionthe dhole occurs in most of india south of the ganges particularly in the central indian highland and the western and eastern ghat it is also present in arunachal pradesh assam meghalaya and west bengal and in the plain terai region dhole population in the himalaya and northwest india are fragmentedin dhole pack were recorded by camera trap in the chitwan national park it presence wa confirmed in the kanchenjunga conservation area in by camera trap in february dhole were sighted in the vansda national park with camera trap confirming the presence of two individual in may of the same year this wa the first confirmed sighting of dhole in gujarat since bhutan the dhole is present in jigme dorji national parkin bangladesh it inhabits forest reserve in the sylhet area a well the chittagong hill tract in the southeast recent camera trap photo in the chittagong in showed the continued presence of the dhole these region probably do not harbour a viable population a mostly small group or solitary individual were sightedin myanmar the dhole is present in several protected area in dhole and tiger were recorded by for the first time in the hill forest of karen stateits range is highly fragmented in the malaysian peninsula sumatra java vietnam and thailand in camera trap video in the montane tropical forest at m ft in the kerinci seblat national park in sumatra revealed it continued presence a camera trapping survey in the khao ang rue nai wildlife sanctuary in thailand from january to february documented one healthy dhole pack in northern lao dhole were studied in nam louey national protected area camera trap survey from recorded dhole in the same nam louey national protected areain vietnam dhole were sighted only in pu mat national park in in yok don national park in and and in ninh thuan province in disjunct dhole population wa reported in the area of trabzon and rize in northeastern turkey near the border with georgia in the this report wa not considered to be reliable one single individual wa claimed to have been shot in in the nearby republic in the central caucasus it remains were analysed in may by a biologist from the state university who concluded that the skull wa indeed of a dhole in august researcher from the national museum of natural history and the karadeniz technical university started an expedition to track and document this possible turkish population of dhole in october they concluded that no real evidence exists of a living dhole population in turkey or in the republic pending dna analysis of sample from the original skin ecology and behaviour social and territorial behaviour dhole are more social than gray wolf and have le of a dominance hierarchy a seasonal scarcity of food is not a serious concern for them in this manner they closely resemble african wild dog in social structure they live in clan rather than pack a the latter term refers to a group of animal that always hunt together in contrast dhole clan frequently break into small pack of to animal particularly during the spring season a this is the optimal number for catching fawn dominant dhole are hard to identify a they do not engage in dominance display a wolf do though other clan member will show submissive behaviour toward them intragroup fighting is rarely observeddholes are far le territorial than wolf with pup from one clan often joining another without trouble once they mature sexually clan typically number to individual in india though clan of have been reported in thailand clan rarely exceed three individual unlike other canid there is no evidence of dhole using urine to mark their territory or travel route when urinating dhole especially male may raise one hind leg or both to result in a handstand handstand urination is also seen in bush dog speothos venaticus they may defecate in conspicuous place though a territorial function is unlikely a faeces are mostly deposited within the clan territory rather than the periphery faeces are often deposited in what appear to be communal latrine they do not scrape the earth with their foot a other canid do to mark their territory denning four kind of den have been described simple earth den with one entrance usually remodeled striped hyena or porcupine den complex cavernous earth den with more than one entrance simple cavernous den excavated under or between rock and complex cavernous den with several other den in the vicinity some of which are interconnected den are typically located under dense scrub or on the bank of dry river or creek the entrance to a dhole den can be almost vertical with a sharp turn three to four foot down the tunnel open into an antechamber from which extends more than one passage some den may have up to six entrance leading up to foot m of interconnecting tunnel these city may be developed over many generation of dhole and are shared by the clan female when raising young together like african wild dog and dingo dhole will avoid killing prey close to their den reproduction and development in india the mating season occurs between and january while captive dhole in the moscow zoo breed mostly in february unlike wolf pack dhole clan may contain more than one breeding female more than one female dhole may den and rear their litter together in the same den during mating the female assumes a crouched position there is no copulatory tie characteristic of other canid when the male dismount instead the pair lie on their side facing each other in a semicircular formation the gestation period last day with litter size averaging four to six pup their growth rate is much faster than that of wolf being similar in rate to that of coyote the hormone metabolite of five male and three female kept in thai zoo wa studied the breeding male showed an increased level of testosterone from october to january the oestrogen level of captive female increase for about week in january followed by an increase of progesterone they displayed sexual behaviour during the oestrogen peak of the femalespups are suckled at least day during this time the pack feed the mother at the den site dhole do not use rendezvous site to meet their pup a wolf do though one or more adult will stay with the pup at the den while the rest of the pack hunt once weaning begin the adult of the clan will regurgitate food for the pup until they are old enough to join in hunting they remain at the den site for day by the age of six month pup accompany the adult on hunt and will assist in killing large prey such a sambar by the age of eight month maximum longevity in captivity is year hunting behaviour before embarking on a hunt clan go through elaborate prehunt social ritual involving nuzzling body rubbing and and heterosexual mounting dhole are primarily diurnal hunter hunting in the early hour of the morning they rarely hunt nocturnally except on moonlit night indicating they greatly rely on sight when hunting although not a fast a jackal and fox they can chase their prey for many hour during a pursuit one or more dhole may take over chasing their prey while the rest of the pack keep up at a steadier pace behind taking over once the other group tire most chase are short lasting only m when chasing prey they run at a pace of mph dhole frequently drive their prey into water body where the targeted animal movement are hinderedonce large prey is caught one dhole will grab the prey nose while the rest of the pack pull the animal down by the flank and hindquarter they do not use a killing bite to the throat they occasionally blind their prey by attacking the eye serow are among the only ungulate specie capable of effectively defending themselves against dhole attack due to their thick protective coat and short sharp horn capable of easily impaling dhole they will tear open their prey flank and disembowel it eating the heart liver lung and some section of the intestine the stomach and rumen are usually left untouched prey weighing le than kg is usually killed within two minute while large stag may take minute to die once prey is secured dhole will tear off piece of the carcass and eat in seclusion unlike wolf pack in which the breeding pair monopolises food dhole give priority to the pup when feeding at a kill allowing them to eat first they are generally tolerant of scavenger at their kill both mother and young are provided with regurgitated food by other pack member feeding ecology prey animal in india include chital sambar deer muntjac mouse deer barasingha wild boar gaur water buffalo banteng cattle nilgai goat indian hare himalayan field rat and langur there is one record of a pack bringing down an indian elephant calf in assam despite desperate defense of the mother resulting in numerous loss to the pack in kashmir they prey on markhor and thamin in myanmar malayan tapir sumatran serow in sumatra and the malay peninsula and javan rusa in java in the tian shan and tarbagatai mountain dhole prey on siberian ibex arkhar roe deer maral and wild boar in the altai and sayan mountain they prey on musk deer and reindeer in eastern siberia they prey on roe deer manchurian wapiti wild pig musk deer and reindeer while in primorye they feed on sika deer and goral in mongolia they prey on argali and rarely siberian ibexlike african wild dog but unlike wolf dhole are not known to attack people dhole eat fruit and vegetable matter more readily than other canid in captivity they eat various kind of grass herb and leaf seemingly for pleasure rather than just when ill in summertime in the tian shan mountain dhole eat large quantity of mountain rhubarb although opportunistic dhole have a seeming aversion to hunting cattle and their calf livestock predation by dhole ha been a problem in bhutan since the late a domestic animal are often left outside to graze in the forest sometimes for week at a time livestock at night and grazed near home are never attacked ox are killed more often than cow probably because they are given le protection enemy and competitor in some area dhole are sympatric to tiger and leopard competition between these specie is mostly avoided through difference in prey selection although there is still substantial dietary overlap along with leopard dhole typically target animal in the kg range mean weight of kg for dhole and kg for leopard while tiger selected for prey animal heavier than kg but their mean prey weight wa kg also other characteristic of the prey such a sex arboreality and aggressiveness may play a role in prey selection for example dhole preferentially select male chital whereas leopard kill both sex more evenly and tiger prefer larger prey altogether dhole and tiger kill langur rarely compared to leopard due to the leopard greater arboreality while leopard kill wild boar infrequently due to the inability of this relatively light predator to tackle aggressive prey of comparable weighton some occasion dhole may attack tiger when confronted by dhole tiger will seek refuge in tree or stand with their back to a tree or bush where they may be mobbed for lengthy period before finally attempting escape escaping tiger are usually killed while tiger which stand their ground have a greater chance of survival tiger are dangerous opponent for dhole a they have sufficient strength to kill a dhole with a single paw strike dhole pack may steal leopard kill while leopard may kill dhole if they encounter them singly or in pair since leopard are smaller than tiger and are more likely to hunt dhole dhole pack tend to react more aggressively toward them than they do towards tigersthere are numerous record of leopard being treed by dhole dhole sometimes drive tiger leopard snow leopard and bear see below from their kill dhole were once thought to be a major factor in reducing asiatic cheetah population though this is doubtful a cheetah live in open area a opposed to forested area favoured by dholesdhole pack occasionally attack asiatic black bear snow leopard and sloth bear when attacking bear dhole will attempt to prevent them from seeking refuge in cave and lacerate their hindquartersalthough usually antagonistic toward wolf they may hunt and feed alongside one another there is at least one record of a lone wolf associating with a pair of dhole in debrigarh wildlife sanctuary they infrequently associate in mixed group with eurasian golden jackal domestic dog may kill dhole though they will feed alongside them on occasion disease and parasite dhole are vulnerable to a number of different disease particularly in area where they are sympatric with other canid specie infectious pathogen such a toxocara canis are present in their faeces they may suffer from rabies canine distemper mange trypanosomiasis canine parvovirus and endoparasite such a cestode and roundworm threat the dhole only rarely take domestic livestock certain people such a the kurumbas and some mon tribe will appropriate dhole kill some indian villager welcome the dhole because of this appropriation of dhole kill dhole were persecuted throughout india for bounty until they were given protection by the wildlife protection act of method used for dhole hunting included poisoning snaring shooting and clubbing at den site native indian people killed dhole primarily to protect livestock while british sporthunters during the british raj did so under the conviction that dhole were responsible for drop in game population persecution of dhole still occurs with varying degree of intensity according to the region bounty paid for dhole used to be rupee though this wa reduced to in after the number of presented dhole carcass became too numerous to maintain the established reward in indochina dhole suffer heavily from nonselective hunting technique such a snaringthe fur trade doe not pose a significant threat to dhole the people of india do not eat dhole flesh and their fur is not considered overly valuable due to their rarity dhole were never harvested for their skin in large number in the soviet union and were sometimes accepted a dog or wolf pelt being labeled a half wolf for the latter the winter fur wa prized by the chinese who bought dhole pelt in ussuriysk during the late for a few silver ruble in the early century dhole pelt reached eight ruble in manchuria in semirechye fur coat made from dhole skin were considered the warmest but were very costly conservation in india the dhole is protected under schedule of the wildlife protection act the creation of reserve under project tiger provided some protection for dhole population sympatric with tiger in the indian government sanctioned it first dhole conservation breeding centre at the indira gandhi zoological park igzp in visakhapatnam the dhole ha been protected in russia since though it is vulnerable to poison left out for wolf in china the animal is listed a a category ii protected specie under the chinese wildlife protection act of in cambodia the dhole is protected from all hunting while conservation law in vietnam limit extraction and utilisationin the korean company sooam biotech wa reported to be attempting to clone the dhole using dog a surrogate mother to help conserve the specie in culture and literature three animal are featured on the coping stone of the bharhut stupa dating from bc they are shown waiting by a tree with a woman or spirit trapped up it a scene reminiscent of dhole treeing tiger the animal fearsome reputation in india is reflected by the number of pejorative name it posse in hindi which variously translate a red devil devil dog jungle devil or hound of kali according to zoologist and explorer leopold von schrenck he had trouble obtaining dhole specimen during his exploration of amurland a the local gilyaks greatly feared the specie this fear and superstition wa not however shared by neighbouring tungusic people von schrenk speculated that this differing attitude towards dhole wa due to the tungusic people more nomadic lifestyle animal are described in numerous old european text including the ostrogoth saga where they are portrayed a hellhound the demon dog accompanying hellequin in mediaeval french passion play a well a the one inhabiting the legendary forest of broceliande have been attributed to dhole according to charles hamilton smith the dangerous wild canid mentioned by scaliger a having lived in the forest of montefalcone could have been based on dhole a they were described a unlike wolf in habit voice and appearance the montefalcone family coat of arm had a pair of red dog a supportersdholes appear in rudyard kipling red dog where they are portrayed a aggressive and bloodthirsty animal which descend from the deccan plateau into the seeonee hill inhabited by mowgli and his adopted wolf pack to cause carnage among the jungle denizen they are described a living in pack numbering hundred of individual and that even shere khan and hathi make way for them when they descend into the jungle the dhole are despised by the wolf because of their destructiveness their habit of not living in den and the hair between their toe with mowgli and kaa help the seeonee wolf pack manages to wipe out the dhole by leading them through bee hive and torrential water before finishing off the rest in battle japanese author uchida roan wrote Quan Wu Yu  inu monogatari a dog tale in a a nationalistic critique of the declining popularity of indigenous dog breed which he asserted were descended from the dhole a fictional version of the dhole imbued with supernatural ability appears in the season episode of tv series the titled alpha dhole also appear a enemy in the video game far cry alongside other predator such a the bengal tiger honey badger snow leopard clouded leopard tibetan wolf and asian black bear they can be found hunting the player and other npc across the map but are easily killed being one of the weakest enemy in the game they once again appear in the video game far cry primal where they play similar role a their counterpart in the previous game but can now also be tamed and used in combat by takkar the main protagonist of the game tameability brian houghton hodgson kept captured dhole in captivity and found with the exception of one animal they remained shy and vicious even after month according to richard lydekker adult dhole are nearly impossible to tame though pup are docile and can even be allowed to play with domestic dog pup until they reach early adulthood a dhole may have been presented a a gift to a tribute see also wild dog diary reference bibliography fox m
