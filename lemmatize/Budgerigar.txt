the budgerigar melopsittacus undulatus is a parrot usually nicknamed the budgie or in american english the parakeet budgie are the only specie in the genus melopsittacus naturally the specie is green and yellow with black scalloped marking on the nape back and wing budgie are bred in captivity with colouring of blue white yellow grey and even with small crest juvenile and chick are monomorphic while adult are told apart by their cere colouring and their behaviour the origin of the budgie name is unclear first recorded in budgerigar are popular pet around the world due to their small size low cost and ability to mimic human speech they are the third most popular pet in the world after the domesticated dog and cat budgie are nomadic flock parakeet that have been bred in captivity since the century in both captivity and the wild budgerigar breed opportunistically and in pair it is found wild throughout the drier part of australia where it ha survived harsh inland condition for over five million year it success can be attributed to a nomadic lifestyle and it ability to breed while on the move the budgerigar is closely related to lory and the fig parrot taxonomy and etymology the budgerigar ha with indigenous australian for year several possible origin for it name have been proposed first it may be a mispronunciation or alteration of the gamilaraay word gidjirrigaa aboriginal pronunciation or gijirragaa from the yuwaalaraay second is a modification budgery or boojery australian english slang for good and gar cockatoo alternative spelling include budgerygah and betcherrygah the latter used by indigenous people of the liverpool plain in new south wale while many reference mention good a part of the meaning and a few specify good bird it is quite possible that report by those local to the region are more accurate in specifying the direct translation a good food however report that this could also translate a tasty treat implying they were eaten by the aborigine are likely to be apocryphal the name likely derived from the specie migratory nature with seasonal change that left the plain barren the budgerigar would move towards residual water that still produced the seed they sought by following the bird the aborigine could locate water and also other game or food plant thus leading to good food the budgerigar wa first described by george shaw in and given it current binomial name by john gould in the genus name melopsittacus from ancient greek mean melodious parrot the specie name undulatus is latin for undulated or alternative name for the budgerigar include the shell parrot the warbling grass parakeet the canary parrot the zebra parrot the flight bird the scallop parrot although more applicable to member of the genus agapornis the name lovebird ha been applied to them from their habit of mutual preening the budgerigar wa thought to be the link between the genus neophema and pezoporus based on the barred plumage however recent phylogenetic study using dna sequence place the budgerigar very close to the lory tribe loriini and the fig parrot tribe cyclopsittini description wild budgerigar average cm in long weigh gram oz cm in in wingspan and display a light green body colour abdomen and rump while their mantle back and wing covert display mantle marking blackish in fledgeling and immatures edged in clear yellow undulation the forehead and face is yellow in adult prior to their adult plumage young individual have blackish stripe down to the cere nose in young individual until around month of age they display small iridescent cheek patch and a series of three black spot across each side of their throat called throat patch the two outermost throat spot are situated at the base of each cheek patch the tail is cobalt and outside tail feather display central yellow flash their wing have flight feather and black covert with yellow fringe along with central yellow flash which only become visible in flight or when the wing are outstretched bill are olive grey and leg with zygodactyl toesin their natural australian habitat budgerigar are noticeably smaller than those in captivity this particular parrot specie ha been bred in many other colour and shade in captivity eg blue grey pieds violet white pet store individual will commonly be blue green or yellow like most parrot specie budgerigar plumage fluoresces under ultraviolet light a phenomenon possibly related to courtship and mate selectionthe upper half of their beak is taller than the bottom half covering the bottom when closed the beak doe not protrude much due to the thick fluffy feather surrounding it giving the appearance of a beak that lie flat against the face the upper half act a a long smooth cover while the bottom half is just about a these beak allow the bird to eat plant fruit and vegetable the colour of the cere the area containing the nostril differs between the sex being royal blue in male pale brown to white nonbreeding or brown breeding in female and pink in immatures of both sex usually of a more even colour in young male some female budgerigar develop brown cere only during breeding time which later return to the normal colour young female can often be identified by a subtle chalky whiteness that start around the nostril male that are either albino lutino clear or recessive pied danishpied or harlequin always retain the immature cere colour their entire life it is usually easy to tell the sex of a budgerigar over six month old mainly by the cere colour but behaviour and head shape also help indicate sex veterinarian can determine the sex of a bird by invasive examination or sample of blood feather or eggshell mature male usually have a cere of light to dark blue but in some particular colour mutation it can be purplish to pink including clear danish pieds recessive pieds and inos which usually display much rounder head the behaviour of male can distinguish them from female male are typically cheerful extroverted highly flirtatious peacefully social and very vocalfemale cere are pinkish while immature a they age they move from being beigish or whitish outside breeding condition into brown often with a texture in breeding condition and usually display flattened back of head right above the nape female are more dominant and le socially tolerant this behavior is more pronounced around other female than with malesbudgerigars have tetrachromatic colour vision although all four class of cone cell will not operate simultaneously unless under sunlight or a uv lamp the ultraviolet spectrum brightens their feather to attract mate the throat spot in budgerigar reflect uv and can be used to distinguish individual bird while ultraviolet light is essential to the good health of caged and pet bird inadequate darkness or rest result in ecology budgerigar are nomadic and flock move on from site a environmental condition change budgerigar are found in open habitat primarily in scrubland open woodland and grassland of australia the bird are normally found in small flock but can form very large flock under favourable condition the nomadic movement of the flock is tied to the availability of food and water drought can drive flock into more wooded habitat or coastal area they feed on the seed of spinifex and grass and sometimes ripening wheat outside of australia the only establishment of naturalised feral budgerigar is a large population near st petersburg florida increased competition for nesting site from european starling and house sparrow is thought to be a primary cause of the florida population declining from the the more consistent condition in florida significantly reduced their nomadic behaviourbudgerigars feed primarily on grass seed the specie also opportunistically depredates growing cereal crop and lawn grass seed behaviour breeding breeding in the wild generally take place between june and september in northern australia and between august and january in the south although budgerigar are opportunistic breeder and respond to rain when grass seed become most abundant they show sign of affection to their flockmates by preening or feeding one another budgerigar feed one another by eating the seed themselves and then regurgitating it into their flockmate mouth population in some area have increased a a result of increased water availability at farm nest are made in hole in tree fence post or log lying on the ground the four to six egg are incubated for day with the young fledging about day after hatchingin the wild virtually all parrot specie require a hollow tree or a hollow log a a nest site because of this natural behaviour budgerigar most easily breed in captivity when provided with a nest box the egg are typically one to two centimetre long and are pearl white without any colouration if fertile female budgerigar can lay egg without a male partner but these unfertilised egg will not hatch female normally have a whitish tan cere however when the female is laying egg her cere turn a crusty brown colour certain female budgie may always keep a whitish tan cere or always keep a crusty brown cere regardless of breeding condition a female budgerigar will lay her egg on alternating day after the first one there is usually a gap until the next she will usually lay between four and eight egg which she will incubate usually starting after laying her second or third for about day each female only leave their nest for very quick defecation stretch and quick meal once they have begun incubating and are by then almost exclusively fed by their mate usually at the nest entrance female will not allow a male to enter the nest unless he force his way inside depending on the clutch size and the beginning of incubation the age difference between the first and last hatchling can be anywhere from to day at time the parent may begin eating their own egg due to feeling insecure in the nest box sometimes budgerigar mainly male are not interested in the opposite sex and will not reproduce with them a flock pair housed where they can see and hear each necessary to stimulate breeding chick health breeding difficulty arise for various reason some chick may die from disease and attack from adult other budgerigar virtually always female may fight over the nest box attacking each other or a brood another problem may be the bird beak being where the lower mandible is above the upper mandible most health issue and physical abnormality in budgerigar are genetic care should be taken that bird used for breeding are active healthy and unrelated budgerigar that are related or have fatty tumour or other potential genetic health problem should not be allowed to breed parasite louse mite worm and pathogen bacteria fungi and virus are contagious and thus transmitted between individual through either direct or indirect contact nest box should be cleaned between us splay leg is a relatively common problem in baby budgerigar and other bird one of the budgerigar leg is bent outward which prevents it from being able to stand properly and compete with the other chick for food and can also lead to difficulty in reproducing in adulthood the condition is caused by young budgerigar slipping repeatedly on the floor of a nest box it is easily avoided by placing a small quantity of a safe bedding or wood shaving in the bottom of the nest box alternatively several piece of paper may be placed in the box for the female to chew into bedding development egg take about day before they start hatching the hatchling are altricial blind naked unable to lift their head and totally helpless and their mother feed them and keep them warm constantly around day of age the chick eye will open and they will start to develop feather down the appearance of down occurs at the age for closed banding of the chick budgerigar closed band ring must be neither larger nor smaller than to mm they develop feather around three week of age one can often easily note the colour mutation of the individual bird at this point at this stage of the chick development the male usually ha begun to enter the nest to help his female in caring and feeding the chick some budgerigar female however totally forbid the male from entering the nest and thus take the full responsibility of rearing the chick until they fledge depending on the size of the clutch and most particularly in the case of single mother it may then be wise to transfer a portion of the hatchling or best of the fertile egg to another pair the foster pair must already be in breeding mode and thus either at the laying or incubating stage or already rearing hatchling a the chick develop and grow feather they are able to be left on their own for longer period of time by the fifth week the chick are strong enough that both parent will be comfortable in staying out of the nest more the youngster will stretch their wing to gain strength before they attempt to fly they will also help defend the box from enemy mostly with their loud screeching young budgerigar typically fledge leave the nest around their fifth week of age and are usually completely weaned between six and eight week old however the age for fledging a well a weaning can vary slightly depending on the age and the number of surviving chick generally speaking the oldest chick is the first to be weaned although it is logically the last one to be weaned the youngest chick is often weaned at a younger age than it older sibling s this can be a result of mimicking the action of older sibling lone surviving chick are often weaned at the youngest possible age a a result of having their parent full attention and care budgie may take slightly longer to wean than chick hand feeding is not routinely done with budgerigar due to their small size and because young parent raised bird can be readily tamed relationship with human aviculture the budgerigar ha been bred in captivity since the breeder have worked to produce a variety of colour pattern and feather mutation including albino blue lacewinged clearwinged crested dark greywinged opaline pieds spangled dilute suffused and violet english budgerigar more correctly called show or exhibition budgerigar are about twice a large a their wild counterpart and have puffier head feather giving them a boldly exaggerated look the eye and beak can be almost totally obscured by these fluffy head feather english budgerigar are typically more expensive than bird and have a shorter life span of about seven to nine year breeder of english budgerigar show their bird at animal show most captive budgerigar in the pet trade are more similar in size and body conformation to wild budgerigar budgerigar are social animal and require stimulation in the shape of toy and interaction with human or with other budgerigar budgerigar and especially female will chew material such a wood when a budgerigar feel threatened it will try to perch a high a possible and to bring it feather close against it body in order to appear thinner tame budgerigar can be taught to speak whistle and play with human both male and female sing and can learn to mimic sound and word and do simple trick but singing and mimicry are more pronounced and better perfected in male female rarely learn to mimic more than a dozen word male can easily acquire vocabulary ranging from a few dozen to a hundred word pet male especially those kept alone are generally the best speakersbudgerigars will chew on anything they can find to keep their beak trimmed mineral block ideally enriched with iodine cuttlebone and soft wooden piece are suitable for this activity cuttlebones also supply calcium essential for the proper forming of egg and bone solidity in captivity budgerigar live an average of five to eight year but life span of year have been reported the life span depends on breed lineage and health being highly influenced by exercise and diet budgerigar have been known to cause bird fancier lung in sensitive people a type of hypersensitivity pneumonitis apart from a handful of illness disease of the specie are not transmittable to human colour mutation all captive budgerigar are divided into two basic series of colour namely blue grey and white and green and yellow presently at least primary mutation including violet occur enabling hundred of possible secondary mutation stable combined primary mutation and colour variety unstable combined mutation mimicry male specimen of budgerigar are considered to be one of the top five talking champion amongst parrot specie alongside the grey parrot the amazon and the eclectus parrot and the parakeetpuck a male budgerigar owned by american camille jordan hold the world record

the medium victor owner ryan b reynolds of canada stated victor wa able to engage in contextual conversation and predict the future although some believe the animal wa able to predict his own death a wa claimed further study on the subject is difficult without the bird the recording still remain to be verified by scientific analysis critic argue victor speech in the recording is not coherent
