chinchilla are either of two specie chinchilla chinchilla and chinchilla lanigera of crepuscular rodent of the parvorder caviomorpha they are slightly larger and more robust than ground squirrel and are native to the andes mountain in south america they live in colony called herd at high elevation of up to m ft historically chinchilla lived in an area that included part of bolivia peru argentina and chile but today colony in the wild are known only in chile along with their relative viscacha they make up the family chinchillidae they are also related to the chinchilla rat the chinchilla ha the densest fur of all mammal that live on land in the water the sea otter ha a denser coat the chinchilla is named after the chincha people of the andes who once wore it dense fur by the end of the century chinchilla had become quite rare after being hunted for their fur most chinchilla currently used by the fur industry for clothing and other accessory are domestic chinchilla descended from c lanigera are sometimes kept a pet and may be considered a type of pocket pet specie the two living specie of chinchilla are chinchilla chinchilla formerly known a chinchilla brevicaudata and chinchilla lanigera c chinchilla ha a shorter tail a thicker neck and shoulder and shorter ear than c lanigera the former specie is currently facing extinction the latter though rare can be found in the wild domesticated chinchilla are thought to be of the c lanigera specie distribution and habitat formerly chinchilla occupied the coastal region hill and mountain of chile peru argentina and bolivia overexploitation caused the downturn of these population and a early a one scientist claimed that the specie wa headed for extinction five year of fieldwork published in in jujuy province argentina failed to find a single specimen population in chile were thought extinct by but the animal wa found to inhabit an area in the antofagasta region in the late and early the animal may be extinct in bolivia and peru though one specimen found in a restaurant in cerro de pasco may hail from a native populationin their native habitat chinchilla live in burrow or crevice in rock they are agile jumper and can jump up to m ft predator in the wild include bird of prey skunk feline snake and canine chinchilla have a variety of defensive tactic including spraying urine and releasing fur if bitten in the wild chinchilla have been observed eating plant leaf fruit seed and small insectsin nature chinchilla live in social group that resemble colony but are properly called herd herd size can range from member up to this is both for social interaction a well a protection from predator they can breed any time of the year their gestation period is day longer than most rodent due to this long pregnancy chinchilla are born fully furred and with eye open litter are usually small in number predominantly two conservation both specie of chinchilla are currently listed a endangered by the iucn red list of threatened specie due to a severe population loss approximated at a global population loss over the last year the severe population decline ha been caused by chinchilla hunting by human until they were listed a indeterminate on the iucn red list in the subspecies wa listed a vulnerable while the subspecies wa listed a critically endangered by both were listed a critically endangered and in they were reclassified a endangered due to limited recovery in some area role with human fur industry chinchilla fur trade on an international level go back to the century their fur is popular due to it extremely soft feel which is caused by the sprouting of hair on average from each hair follicle the color is usually very even which make it ideal for small garment or the lining of larger one though some large piece can be made entirely from the fur a single coat made from chinchilla fur may require a many a pelt a chinchilla are relatively small their use for fur led to the extinction of one specie and put serious pressure on the other two though it is illegal to hunt wild chinchilla they are now on the verge of becoming extinct because of continued poaching domesticated chinchilla are still bred for fur a pet the domestic chinchilla is descended from chinchilla lanigera the chinchilla and the more common one in the wild after the other specie chinchilla chinchilla or chinchilla ha been hunted nearly to extinction therefore domestic chinchilla have thinner body longer tail and larger ear chinchilla are popular pet though they require extensive exercise and dental care due to their teeth continually growing throughout their life span and since they lack the ability to sweat they require a environmentthe animal instinctively clean their fur by taking dust bath in which they roll around in special dust made of fine pumice a few time a week they do not bathe in water their thick fur resists parasite such a flea and reduces loose dander in scientific research chinchilla have been used in research since the since the the prime interest in chinchilla by researcher is their auditory system other research field in which chinchilla are used a an animal model include the study of chaga disease gastrointestinal disease pneumonia and listeriosis a well a of yersinia and pseudomonas infection veterinary medicine fracture chinchilla live active life and can recover well from minor physical injury fracture may be problematic because chinchilla will want to sit on their hind leg and eat with their front paw so many type of injury will disturb their natural eating behavior convulsion chinchilla breeder sometimes report seeing their animal have convulsion typically this happens only irregularly and then only for a few second and not more than a few minute at the most convulsion are a symptom that can have many cause including a brain problem such a hemorrhaging a vitamin or dietary element deficiency in the diet or some kind of nervous system injury if convulsion are observed after chinchilla mate then it is not unlikely that they are related to a circulatory problem some chinchilla who are kept in group have stress convulsion during feeding if they see other chinchilla getting food first vitamin b cardiac medication or a calcium injection may be used to prevent convulsion infectious disease listeriosis is not a typical chinchilla disease but in group housing condition it can spread a a digestive tract disease in a community pasteurella can be contracted from food and then transmitted among a group of chinchilla symptom include apathy digestive disorder and fever pseudomonas aeruginosa infection are widely distributed in nature and can affect chinchilla like many other animal they can cause wide death in population of chinchilla and spontaneous abortion in pregnant chinchillasrespiratory tract infection can be caused by many pathogen but regardless of cause usually result in difficult breathing and a nasal discharge young chinchilla are more likely to be affected and these infection are unlikely to result in an epidemic even if transmissiblegastrointestinal disorder are observed a either constipation or diarrhea these are almost always the result of a problem with the diet but if the diet is optimal they could be the symptom of an infectious disease constipation in chinchilla is difficult to observe in group because it may not be obvious than an animal is not contributing to the population waste if it is identified mild treatment include feeding paraffin to soften the feces mental health chinchilla are easily distressed and when they are unhappy they may exhibit physical symptom a common indicator of stress in pet chinchilla is or fur barbering an excessive grooming behavior that result in uneven patch of fur chinchilla may chew their own fur or that of their cagemates can sometimes be alleviated through change in living environment but is regarded by some expert to be passed genetically from parent to offspring usually itself is a benign symptom that not doe not cause physiological distresssick chinchilla may stop eating if they are stressed which can make them even more weak chinchilla which live in community are especially sensitive in their breeding season of february to march and august to september chinchilla are social animal and are likely to be upset to have their breeding mate changed in breeding season they are known to be disturbed by a change of diet in these time pharmaceutical treatment chinchilla may be treated with chloramphenicol neomycin or spectinomycin for digestive problem sulfonamide dissolved in drinking water may be used colistin can be an effective antibiotic reference source kraft helmut disease of chinchilla translated by u erich friese neptune
