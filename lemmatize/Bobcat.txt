the bobcat lynx rufus also known a the red lynx is a cat native to north america from southern canada most of the contiguous united state to oaxaca in mexico it is listed a least concern on the iucn red list since because it is widely distributed and abundant although it ha been hunted extensively both for sport and fur population have proven resilient though declining in some areasit ha distinctive black bar on it foreleg and a stubby or bobbed tail from which it derives it name it is smaller on average than the canada lynx with which it share part of it range but is about twice a large a the domestic cat it is an adaptable predator inhabiting wooded area a well a semidesert urban edge forest edge and swampland environment it remains in some of it original range but population are vulnerable to local extinction extirpation by coyote and domestic animal though the bobcat prefers rabbit and hare it hunt insect chicken goose and other bird small rodent and deer prey selection depends on location and habitat season and abundance like most cat the bobcat is territorial and largely solitary although with some overlap in home range it us several method to mark it territorial boundary including claw mark and deposit of urine or feces the bobcat breed from winter into spring and ha a gestation period of about two month two subspecies are recognised one east of the great plain and the other west of the great plain they were probably separated during interglacial period in the pleistocene by the aridification of the great plain it first appeared during the irvingtonian stage around million year ago the elusive predator feature in some indigenous people of north and central america story and in the folklore of european colonizer taxonomy there had been debate over whether to classify this specie a lynx rufus or felis rufus a part of a wider issue regarding whether the four specie of lynx should be given their own genus or be placed a a subgenus of felis the genus lynx is now accepted and the bobcat is listed a lynx rufus in modern taxonomic source johnson et al reported lynx shared a clade with the puma leopard cat prionailurus and domestic cat felis lineage dated to million year ago mya lynx diverged first approximately million year agothe bobcat is believed to have evolved from the eurasian lynx which crossed into north america by way of the bering land bridge during the pleistocene with progenitor arriving a early a million year ago the first wave moved into the southern portion of north america which wa soon cut off from the north by glacier this population evolved into modern bobcat around year ago a second population arrived from asia and settled in the north developing into the modern canada lynx hybridization between the bobcat and the canada lynx may sometimes occur subspecies bobcat subspecies have been historically recognized based on morphological characteristic l r rufus schreber eastern and midwestern united

south into tamaulipas nuevo leon and coahuilathis subspecies division ha been challenged given a lack of clear geographic break in their range and the minor difference between these subspecies the latest revision of cat taxonomy in by the cat classification taskforce of the cat specialist group recognises only two subspecies based on phylogeographic and genetic study although the status of the mexican bobcat lynx rufus esquinapae syn lynx rufus oaxacensis remains under review lynx rufus rufus east of the great plain north america lynx rufus fasciatus west of the great plain north america physical characteristic the bobcat resembles other specie of the midsize genus lynx but is on average the smallest of the four it coat is variable though generally tan to with black streak on the body and dark bar on the foreleg and tail it spotted patterning act a camouflage the ear are and pointed with short black tuft generally an color is seen on the lip chin and underpart bobcat in the desert region of the southwest have the coat while those in the northern forested region are darkest kitten are born and already have their spot a few melanistic bobcat have been sighted and captured in florida they appear black but may still exhibit a spot patternthe face appears wide due to ruff of extended hair beneath the ear bobcat eye are yellow with round black pupil the nose of the bobcat is and it ha a base color of gray or or on it face side and back the pupil are round black circle and will widen during nocturnal activity to maximize light reception the cat ha sharp hearing and vision and a good sense of smell it is an excellent climber and swim when it need to but normally avoids water however case of bobcat swimming long distance across lake have been recordedthe adult bobcat is to cm to in long from the head to the base of it distinctive stubby tail averaging cm in the tail which appears bobbed and give the specie it name add to cm to in an adult stand about to cm to in at the shoulder adult male can range in weight from to kg to lb with an average of kg lb female at to kg to lb with an average of kg lb the largest bobcat accurately measured on record weighed kg lb although unverified report have them reaching kg lb furthermore a june report of a new hampshire roadkill specimen listed the animal weight at kg lb the bobcat are from eastern canada and northern new england of the subspecies l r gigas while the smallest are from the southeastern subspecies l r floridanus particularly those in the southern appalachian the bobcat is muscular and it hind leg are longer than it front leg giving it a somewhat irregular gait at birth it weighs to lb to g and is about in cm in length by it first birthday it weighs about lb kg the cat is larger in it northern range and in open habitat a morphological size comparison study in the eastern united state found a divergence in the location of the largest male and female specimen suggesting differing selection constraint for the sex behavior the bobcat is crepuscular and is active mostly during twilight it keep on the move from three hour before sunset until about midnight and then again from before dawn until three hour after sunrise each night it move from to mi to km along it habitual route this behavior may vary seasonally a bobcat become more diurnal during fall and winter in response to the activity of their prey which are more active during the day in colder weather social structure and home range bobcat activity are confined to territory which vary in size depending on the sex and the distribution of prey the home range is marked with feces urine scent and by clawing prominent tree in the area in it territory the bobcat ha numerous place of shelter usually a main den and several auxiliary shelter on the outer extent of it range such a hollow log brush pile thicket or under rock ledge it den smell strongly of the bobcatthe size of bobcat home range vary significantly a world conservation union iucn summary of research suggests range from to sq mi to one study in kansa found resident male to have range of roughly sq mi and female le than half that area transient bobcat were found to have both larger roughly sq mi and le home range kitten had the smallest range at about sq mi dispersal from the natal range is most pronounced with malesreports on seasonal variation in range size have been equivocal one study found a large variation in male range size from sq mi in summer up to sq mi in winter another found that female bobcat especially those which were reproductively active expanded their home range in winter but that male merely shifted their range without expanding it which wa consistent with numerous earlier study other research in various american state ha shown little or no seasonal variationlike most feline the bobcat is largely solitary but range often overlap unusual for cat male are more tolerant of overlap while female rarely wander into others range given their smaller range size two or more female may reside within a male home range when multiple territory overlap a dominance hierarchy is often established resulting in the exclusion of some transient from favored areasin line with widely differing estimate of home range size population density figure are divergent from one to bobcat per sq mi in one survey the average is estimated at one bobcat per square mile a link ha been observed between population density and sex ratio one study noted a dense unhunted population in california had a sex ratio of male per female when the density decreased the sex ratio skewed to male per female another study observed a similar ratio and suggested the male may be better able to cope with the increased competition and this helped limit reproduction until various factor lowered the density hunting and diet the bobcat is able to survive for long period without food but eats heavily when prey is abundant during lean period it often prey on larger animal which it can kill and return to feed on later the bobcat hunt by stalking it prey and then ambushing with a short chase or pounce it preference is for mammal weighing about to lb to kg it main prey varies by region in the eastern united state it is the eastern cottontail and new england cottontail and in the north it is the snowshoe hare when these prey specie exist together a in new england they are the primary food source of the bobcat in the far south the rabbit and hare are sometimes replaced by cotton rat a the primary food source bird up to the size of an adult trumpeter swan are also taken in ambush along with their fledgling and egg the bobcat is an opportunistic predator that unlike the more specialized canada lynx readily varies it prey selection diet diversification positively correlate to a decline in number of the bobcat principal prey the abundance of it main prey specie is the main determinant of overall dietthe bobcat hunt animal of different size and adjusts it hunting technique accordingly with small animal such a rodent including squirrel bird fish including small shark and insect it hunt in area known to be abundant in prey and will lie crouch or stand and wait for victim to wander close it then pounce grabbing it prey with it sharp retractable claw for slightly larger animal such a goose rabbit and hare it stalk from cover and wait until prey come within to ft to m before rushing in to attack le commonly it feed on larger animal such a young ungulate and other carnivore such a fisher primarily female fox mink marten skunk small dog and domesticated cat bobcat are considered the major predatory threat to the endangered whooping crane bobcat are also occasional hunter of livestock and poultry while larger specie such a cattle and horse are not known to be attacked bobcat do present a threat to smaller ruminant such a sheep and goat according to the national agricultural statistic service bobcat killed sheep in comprising of all sheep predator death however some amount of bobcat predation may be misidentified a bobcat have been known to scavenge on the remains of livestock kill by other animalsit ha been known to kill deer especially in winter when smaller prey is scarce or when deer population become more abundant one study in the everglades showed a large majority of kill of were fawn but prey up to eight time the bobcat weight could be successfully taken it stalk the deer often when the deer is lying down then rush in and grab it by the neck before biting the throat base of the skull or chest on the rare occasion a bobcat kill a deer it eats it fill and then buries the carcass under snow or leaf often returning to it several time to feedthe bobcat prey base overlap with that of other midsized predator of a similar ecological niche research in maine ha shown little evidence of competitive relationship between the bobcat and coyote or red fox separation distance and territory overlap appeared random among simultaneously monitored animal however other study have found bobcat population may decrease in area with high coyote population with the more social inclination of the canid giving them a possible competitive advantage with the canada lynx however the interspecific relationship affect distribution pattern competitive exclusion by the bobcat is likely to have prevented any further southward expansion of the range of it felid relative reproduction and life cycle the average bobcat lifespan is year long and rarely exceeds year the oldest wild bobcat on record wa year old and the oldest captive bobcat lived to be generally begin breeding by their second summer though female may start a early a their first year sperm production begin each year by september or october and the male is fertile into the summer a dominant male travel with a female and mate with her several time generally from winter until early spring this varies by location but most mating take place during february and march the pair may undertake a number of different behavior including bumping chasing and ambushing other male may be in attendance but remain uninvolved once the male recognizes the female is receptive he grasp her in the typical felid neck grip and mate with her the female may later go on to mate with other male and male generally mate with several female during courtship the otherwise silent bobcat may let out loud scream hiss or other sound research in texas ha suggested establishing a home range is necessary for breeding studied animal with no set range had no identified offspring the female ha an estrous cycle of day with the estrus lasting five to ten day bobcat remain reproductively active throughout their livesthe female raise the young alone one to six but usually two to four kitten are born in april or may after roughly to day of gestation sometimes a second litter is born a late a september the female generally give birth in an enclosed space usually a small cave or hollow log the young open their eye by the ninth or tenth day they start exploring their surroundings at four week and are weaned at about two month within three to five month they begin to travel with their mother they hunt by themselves by fall of their first year and usually disperse shortly thereafter in michigan however they have been observed staying with their mother a late a the next spring track bobcat track show four toe without claw mark due to their retractable claw the track can range in size from to in to cm the average is about inch when walking or trotting the track are spaced roughly to in to cm apart the bobcat can make great stride when running often from to ft to m like all cat the bobcat register meaning it hind print usually fall exactly on top of it fore print bobcat track can be generally distinguished from feral or house cat track by their larger size about versus ecology the adult bobcat ha relatively few predator other than human however seldomly it may be killed in interspecific conflict by several larger predator or fall prey to them cougar and gray wolf can kill adult bobcat a behavior repeatedly observed in yellowstone national park a well a elsewhere coyote have killed adult bobcat and kitten at least one confirmed observation of a bobcat and an american black bear ursus americanus fighting over a carcass is confirmed like other lynx specie bobcat probably avoid encounter with bear in part because they are likely to lose kill to them or may be rarely be attacked by them bobcat remains have occasionally been found in the resting site of male fisher american alligator alligator mississippensis have been filmed opportunistically preying on adult bobcat in the southeast united state kitten may be taken by several predator including owl almost entirely great horned owl eagle fox and bear a well a other adult male bobcat when prey population are not abundant fewer kitten are likely to reach adulthood golden eagle aquila chrysaetos have been reportedly observed preying on bobcatsdiseases accident hunter automobile and starvation are the other leading cause of death juvenile show high mortality shortly after leaving their mother while still perfecting their hunting technique one study of bobcat showed yearly survival rate for both sex averaged in line with other research suggesting rate of to cannibalism ha been reported kitten may be taken when prey level are low but this is very rare and doe not much influence the populationthe bobcat may have external parasite mostly tick and flea and often carry the parasite of it prey especially those of rabbit and squirrel internal parasite endoparasite are especially common in bobcat one study found an average infection rate of from toxoplasma gondii but with great regional variation one mite in particular lynxacarus morlani ha to date been found only on the bobcat parasite and disease role in the mortality of the bobcat is still unclear but they may account for greater mortality than starvation accident and predation distribution and habitat the bobcat is an adaptable animal it prefers coniferous or unlike the other lynx specie it doe not depend exclusively on the deep forest it range from the humid swamp of florida to desert land of texas or rugged mountain area it make it home near agricultural area if rocky ledge swamp or forested tract are present it spotted coat serf a camouflage the population of the bobcat depends primarily on the population of it prey other principal factor in the selection of habitat type include protection from severe weather availability of resting and den site dense cover for hunting and escape and freedom from disturbancethe bobcat range doe not seem to be limited by human population a long a it can find a suitable habitat only large intensively cultivated tract are unsuitable for the specie the animal may appear in back yard in urban edge environment where human development intersects with natural habitat if chased by a dog it usually climb up a treethe historical range of the bobcat wa from southern canada throughout the united state and a far south a the mexican state of oaxaca and it still persists across much of this area in the century it wa thought to have lost territory in the u midwest and part of the northeast including southern minnesota eastern south dakota and much of missouri mostly due to habitat change from modern agricultural practice while thought to no longer exist in western new york and pennsylvania multiple confirmed sighting of bobcat including dead specimen have been recently reported in new york southern tier and in central new york and a bobcat wa captured in on a tourist boat in downtown pittsburgh pennsylvania in addition bobcat sighting have been confirmed in northern indiana and one wa recently killed near albion michigan in early march a bobcat wa sighted and later captured by animal control authority in a parking garage in downtown houston by bobcat appear to have recolonized many state occurring in every state in the continuous except delawareits population in canada is limited due to both snow depth and the presence of the canadian lynx the bobcat doe not tolerate deep snow and wait out heavy storm in sheltered area it lack the large padded foot of the canadian lynx and can not support it weight on snow a efficiently the bobcat is not entirely at a disadvantage where it range meet that of the larger felid displacement of the canadian lynx by the aggressive bobcat ha been observed where they interact in nova scotia while the clearing of coniferous forest for agriculture ha led to a northward retreat of the canadian lynx range to the advantage of the bobcat in northern and central mexico the cat is found in dry scrubland and forest of pine and oak it range end at the tropical southern portion of the country conservation it is listed in appendix ii of the convention on international trade in endangered specie of wild fauna and flora cite which mean it is not considered threatened with extinction but hunting and trading must be closely monitored the animal is regulated in all three of it range country and is found in a number of protected area of the united state it principal territory estimate from the u fish and wildlife service placed bobcat number between and in the u in with increased range and population density suggesting even greater number in subsequent year for these reason the u ha petitioned cite to remove the cat from appendix ii population in canada and mexico remain stable and healthy it is listed a least concern on the iucn red list noting it is relatively widespread and abundant but information from southern mexico is poorthe specie is considered endangered in ohio indiana and new jersey it wa removed from the threatened list of illinois in and of iowa in in pennsylvania limited hunting and trapping are once again allowed after having been banned from to the bobcat also suffered population decline in new jersey at the turn of the century mainly because of commercial and agricultural development causing habitat fragmentation by the bobcat wa given full legal protection and wa listed a endangered in the state in l r escuinipae the subspecies found in mexico wa for a time considered endangered by the u fish and wildlife service but wa delisted in bobcat ha long been valued both for fur and sport it ha been hunted and trapped by human but ha maintained a high population even in the southern united state where it is extensively hunted in the and an unprecedented rise in price for bobcat fur caused further interest in hunting but by the early price had dropped significantly regulated hunting still continues with half of mortality of some population being attributed to this cause a a result the rate of bobcat death is skewed in winter when hunting season is generally openurbanization can result in the fragmentation of contiguous natural landscape into patchy habitat within an urban area animal that live in these fragmented area often have reduced movement between the habitat patch which can lead to reduced gene flow and pathogen transmission between patch animal such a the bobcat are particularly sensitive to fragmentation because of their large home range a study in coastal southern california ha shown bobcat population are affected by urbanization creation of road and other development the population may not be declining a much a predicted but instead the connectivity of different population is affected this lead to a decrease in natural genetic diversity among bobcat population for bobcat preserving open space in sufficient quantity and quality is necessary for population viability educating local resident about the animal is critical a well for conservation in urban areasin bobcat using urban habitat in california the use of rodenticides ha been linked to both secondary poisoning by consuming poisoned rat and mouse and to increased rate of severe mite infestation known a notoedric mange a an animal with a immune system is le capable of fighting off mange liver autopsy in california bobcat that have succumbed to notoedric mange have revealed chronic rodenticide exposure alternative rodent control measure such a vegetation control and use of trap have been suggested to alleviate this issue importance in human culture story featuring the bobcat in many variation are found in some indigenous culture of north america with parallel in south america a story from the nez perce for instance depicts lynx and coyote a opposed antithetical being however another version depicts them with equality and identicality in a shawnee tale the bobcat is outwitted by a rabbit which give rise to it spot after trapping the rabbit in a tree the bobcat is persuaded to build a fire only to have the ember scattered on it fur leaving it singed with dark brown spot the mohave believed dreaming habitually of being or object would afford them their characteristic a supernatural power dreaming of two deity cougar and lynx they thought would grant them the superior hunting skill of other tribe european colonizer to the america also admired the cat both for it ferocity and it grace and in the united state it rest prominently in the anthology of national folklore grave artifact from dirt dome excavated in the along the illinois river revealed a complete skeleton of a young bobcat along with a collar made of bone pendant and shell bead that had been buried by the hopewell culture the type and place of burial indicate a tamed and cherished pet or possible spiritual significance the hopewell normally buried their dog so the bone were initially identified a remains of a puppy but dog were usually buried close to the village and not in the mound themselves this is the only wild cat decorated burial on the archaeological record see
