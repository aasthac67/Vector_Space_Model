columbidae is a bird family consisting of pigeon and dove it is the only family in the order columbiformes these are bird with short neck and short slender bill that in some specie feature fleshy cere they primarily feed on seed fruit and plant the family occurs worldwide but the greatest variety is in the indomalayan and australasian realm the family contains specie divided into genus thirteen of the specie are extinctin english the smaller specie tend to be called dove and the larger one pigeon the distinction is not consistent however and doe not exist in most other language for example the woodpigeon is often referred to by another name a the ringdove due to the white marking on it neck historically the common name for these bird involve a great deal of variation between the term the bird most commonly referred to a just pigeon is the domestic pigeon which is common in many city a the feral pigeon pigeon is a french word that derives from the latin pipio for a peeping chick while dove is a germanic word that refers to the bird diving flight the english dialectal word culver appears to derive from latin columba a group of dove is called a dule pronounced taken from the french word deuil mourning dove and pigeon build relatively flimsy nest often using stick and other debris which may be placed on branch of tree on ledge or on the ground depending on specie they lay one or usually two white egg at a time and both parent care for the young which leave the nest after day unfledged baby dove and pigeon are called squab and are generally able to fly by week of age these fledgling with their immature squeaking voice are called squeaker once they are weaned or weaning unlike most bird both sex of dove and pigeon produce crop milk to feed to their young secreted by a sloughing of cell from the lining of the crop taxonomy and systematics the name columbidae for the family wa introduced by the english zoologist william elford leach in a guide to the content of the british museum published in columbidae is the only living family in the order columbiformes the sandgrouse pteroclidae were formerly placed here but were moved to a separate order pterocliformes based on anatomical difference eg they are unable to drink by sucking or pumping they are now considered to be more closely related to shorebird recent phylogenomic study support the grouping of pigeon and sandgrouse together along with mesites forming the sister taxon to mirandornithesthe columbidae are usually divided into five subfamily probably inaccurately for example the american ground and quail dove geotrygon which are usually placed in the columbinae seem to be two distinct subfamily the order presented here follows baptista et al with some updatesthe arrangement of genus and naming of subfamily is in some case provisional because analysis of different dna sequence yield result that differ often radically in the placement of certain mainly genus this ambiguity probably caused by long branch attraction seems to confirm the first pigeon evolved in the australasian region and that the treronidae and allied form crowned and pheasant pigeon for example represent the earliest radiation of the groupthe family columbidae previously also contained the family raphidae consisting of the extinct rodrigues solitaire and the dodo these specie are in all likelihood part of the radiation that produced the three small subfamily mentioned above with the fruit dove and pigeon including the nicobar pigeon therefore they are here included a a subfamily raphinae pending better material evidence of their exact relationshipsexacerbating these issue columbids are not well represented in the fossil record no truly primitive form have been found to date the genus gerandia ha been described from early miocene deposit in france but while it wa long believed to be a pigeon it is now considered a sandgrouse fragmentary remains of a probably ptilinopine early miocene pigeon were found in the bannockburn formation of new zealand and described a rupephaps columbina prattae from roughly contemporary deposit of florida is nowadays tentatively separated in arenicolumba but it distinction from and related genus need to be more firmly established eg by cladistic analysis apart from that all other fossil belong to extant genus taxonomy taxonomy based on the work by john h boyd iii a professor of economics description size and appearance pigeon and dove exhibit considerable variation in size ranging in length from to centimetre to in and in weight from g lb to above g lb the largest specie is the crowned pigeon of new guinea which is nearly at a weight of kg lb the smallest is the new world ground dove of the genus columbina which is the same size a a house sparrow weighing a little a g lb the dwarf fruit dove which may measure a little a cm in ha a marginally smaller total length than any other specie from this family one of the largest arboreal specie the marquesan imperial pigeon currently battle extinction anatomy and physiology overall the anatomy of columbidae is characterized by short leg short bill with a fleshy cere and small head on large compact body like some other bird the columbidae have no gall bladder some medieval naturalist concluded they have no bile gall which in the medieval theory of the four humour explained the allegedly sweet disposition of dove in fact however they do have bile a aristotle had earlier realized which is secreted directly into the gut the wing are large and have eleven primary feather pigeon have strong wing muscle wing muscle comprise of their body weight and are among the strongest flier of all birdsin a series of experiment in by dr mark b friedman using dove their characteristic head bobbing wa shown to be due to their natural desire to keep their vision constant it wa shown yet again in a experiment by dr barrie j frost in which pigeon were placed on treadmill it wa observed that they did not bob their head a their surroundings were constant feather columbidae have unique body feather with the shaft being generally broad strong and flattened tapering to a fine point abruptly in general the aftershaft is absent however small one on some tail and wing feather may be present body feather have very dense fluffy base are attached loosely into the skin and drop out easily possibly serving a a predator avoidance mechanism large number of feather fall out in the attacker mouth if the bird is snatched facilitating the bird escape the plumage of the family is variable granivorous specie tend to have dull plumage with a few exception whereas the frugivorous specie have brightly coloured plumage the ptilinopus fruit dove are some of the brightest coloured pigeon with the three endemic specie of fiji and the indian ocean alectroenas being the brightest pigeon and dove may be sexually monochromatic or dichromatic in addition to bright colour pigeon may sport crest or other ornamentation flight columbidae are excellent flier due to the lift provided by their large wing which result in low wing loading they are highly maneuverable in flight and have a low aspect ratio due to the width of their wing allowing for quick flight launch and ability to escape from predator but at a high energy cost distribution and habitat pigeon and dove are distributed everywhere on earth except for the driest area of the sahara desert antarctica and it surrounding island and the high arctic they have colonised most of the world oceanic island reaching eastern polynesia and the chatham island in the pacific mauritius the seychelles and reunion in the indian ocean and the azores in the atlantic ocean the family ha adapted to most of the habitat available on the planet these specie may be arboreal terrestrial or various specie also inhabit savanna grassland desert temperate woodland and forest mangrove forest and even the barren sand and gravel of atollssome specie have large natural range the eared dove range across the entirety of south america from colombia to tierra del fuego the eurasian collared dove ha a massive if discontinuous distribution from britain across europe the middle east india pakistan and china and the laughing dove across most of africa a well a india pakistan and the middle east other specie have tiny restricted distribution this is most common in island endemic the whistling dove is endemic to the tiny kadavu island in fiji the caroline ground dove is restricted to two island truk and pohnpei in the caroline island and the grenada dove is restricted to grenada in the caribbean some continental specie also have tiny distribution for example the fruit dove is restricted to a small area of the arnhem land of australia the somali pigeon is restricted to a tiny area of northern somalia and moreno ground dove is restricted to the area around salta and tucuman in northern argentinathe largest range of any specie is that of the rock dove this specie had a large natural distribution from britain and ireland to northern africa across europe arabia central asia india the himalaya and up into china and mongolia the range of the specie increased dramatically upon domestication a the specie went feral in city around the world the specie is currently resident across most of north america and ha established itself in city and urban area in south america africa southeast asia japan australia and new zealand the specie is not the only pigeon to have increased it range due to the action of man several other specie have become established outside of their natural range after escaping captivity and other specie have increased their natural range due to habitat change caused by human activity a study found that the east coast of the u includes two pigeon genetic megacities in new york and boston and they do mix behaviour male pigeon are more opportunistic to mate with another female feeding seed and fruit form the major component of the diet of pigeon and dove in fact the family can be divided into the or granivorous specie subfamily columbinae and the or frugivorous specie the other four subfamily the granivorous specie typically feed on seed found on the ground whereas the frugivorous specie tend to feed in tree there are morphological adaptation that can be used to distinguish between the two group granivores tend to have thick wall in their gizzard intestine and esophagus whereas the frugivores tend to have thin wall in addition specie have short intestine whereas those that eat seed have longer one frugivores are capable of clinging to branch and even hang upside down to reach fruitin addition to fruit and seed a number of other food item are taken by many specie some particularly the ground dove and eat a large number of prey item such a insect and worm one specie the atoll fruit dove is specialised in taking insect and reptile prey snail moth and other insect are taken by pigeon orange fruit dove and ruddy ground dove status and conservation while many specie of pigeon and dove have benefited from human activity and have increased their range many other specie have declined in number and some have become threatened or even succumbed to extinction among the ten specie to have become extinct since the conventional date for estimating modern extinction are two of the most famous extinct specie the dodo and the passenger pigeonthe passenger pigeon wa exceptional for a number of reason in modern time it is the only pigeon specie that wa not an island specie to have become extinct even though it wa once the most numerous specie of bird on earth it former number are difficult to estimate but one ornithologist alexander wilson estimated one flock he observed contained over two billion bird the decline of the specie wa abrupt in a breeding colony wa estimated to contain over a hundred million bird yet the last individual in the specie wa dead by although habitat loss wa a contributing factor the specie is thought to have been massively being used a food for slave and later the poor in the united state throughout the centurythe dodo and it extinction wa more typical of the extinction of pigeon in the past like many specie that colonise remote island with few predator it lost much of it predator avoidance behaviour along with it ability to fly the arrival of people along with a suite of other introduced specie such a rat pig and cat quickly spelled the end for this specie and all the other island form that have become extinctaround specie of pigeon and dove are threatened with extinction today about of all specie most of these are tropical and live on island all of the specie are threatened by introduced predator habitat loss hunting or a combination of these factor in some case they may be extinct in the wild a is the socorro dove of socorro island mexico last seen in the wild in driven to extinction by habitat loss and introduced feral cat in some area a lack of knowledge mean the true status of a specie is unknown the negro fruit dove ha not been seen since and may or may not be extinct and the polynesian ground dove is classified a critically endangered a whether it survives or not on remote island in the far west of the pacific ocean is unknownvarious conservation technique are employed to prevent these extinction including law and regulation to control hunting pressure the establishment of protected area to prevent further habitat loss the establishment of captive population for reintroduction back into the wild ex situ conservation and the translocation of individual to suitable habitat to create additional population military the pigeon wa used in both world war i and ii notably by the australian french german american and uk force they were also awarded with various laurel throughout for their service on december three pigeon winkie tyke and white vision were awarded the first dickin medal serving with britain royal air force for rescuing an air force crew during world war ii pigeon have been decorated with the dickin medal citing them for brave service for war contribution including commando gi joe paddy royal blue and william of orangecher ami a homing pigeon in world war i wa awarded the croix de guerre medal by france with a palm oak leaf cluster for her service in verdun despite having almost lost a leg and being shot in the chest she managed to travel around mile to deliver the message that saved men of the lost battalion of the infantry division in the battle of the argonne in october when cher ami died she wa mounted and is part of the permanent exhibit at the national museum of american history of the smithsonian institutiona grand ceremony wa held in buckingham palace to commemorate a platoon of pigeon that braved the battlefield of normandy to deliver vital plan to allied force on the fringe of germany three of the actual bird that received the medal are on show in the london military museum so that can pay their respect domestication the rock pigeon ha been domesticated for hundred of year it ha been bred into several variety kept by hobbyist of which the best known is the homing pigeon or racing homer other popular breed are tumbling pigeon such a the birmingham roller and fancy variety that are bred for certain physical characteristic such a large feather on the foot or tail domesticated rock pigeon are also bred a carrier pigeon used for thousand of year to carry brief written message and release dove used in ceremony white dove are also commonly used in magic act in religion in ancient mesopotamia dove were prominent animal symbol of the goddess of love sexuality and war dove are shown on cultic object associated with inanna a early a the beginning of the third millennium bc lead dove figurine were discovered in the temple of ishtar at assur dating to the thirteenth century bc and a painted fresco

temple of aphrodite pandemos on the southwest slope of the athenian acropolis wa decorated with relief sculpture of dove with knotted fillet in their beak and votive offering of small white marble dove were discovered in the temple of aphrodite at daphni during aphrodite main festival the aphrodisia her altar would be purified with the blood of a sacrificed dove aphrodite association with dove influenced the roman goddess venus and fortuna causing them to become associated with dove a well in the hebrew bible dove or young pigeon are acceptable burnt offering for those who can not afford a more expensive animal in genesis noah sends a dove out of the ark but it came back to him because the floodwaters had not receded seven day later he sent it again and it came back with an olive branch

related to the sign of the dove jesus parent sacrificed dove on his behalf after his circumcision luke later the holy spirit descended upon jesus at his baptism like a dove matthew and subsequently the peace dove became a common christian symbol of the holy spiritin islam dove and the pigeon family in general are respected and favoured because they are believed to have assisted the final prophet of islam muhammad in distracting his enemy outside the cave of thaw r in the great hijra a pair of pigeon had built a nest and laid egg at once and a spider had woven cobweb which in the darkness of the night made the fugitive believe that muhammad could not be in that cave a food several specie of pigeon and dove are used a food however all type are edible domesticated or hunted pigeon have been used a the source of food since the time of the ancient middle east ancient rome and medieval europe it is familiar meat within jewish arab and french cuisine according to the tanakh dove are kosher and they are the only bird that may be used for a korban other kosher bird may be eaten but not brought a a korban pigeon is also used in asian cuisine such a chinese assamese and indonesian cuisine in europe the wood pigeon is commonly shot a a game bird while rock pigeon were originally domesticated a a food specie and many breed were developed for their quality the extinction of the passenger
