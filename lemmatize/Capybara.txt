the capybara hydrochoerus hydrochaeris is a giant cavy rodent native to south america it is the largest living rodent in the world also called capivara in brazil chiguire chiguiro in colombia and venezuela carpincho in argentina paraguay and uruguay and ronsoco in peru it is a member of the genus hydrochoerus of which the only other extant member is the lesser capybara hydrochoerus isthmius it close relative include guinea pig and rock cavy and it is more distantly related to the agouti the chinchilla and the coypu the capybara inhabits savanna and dense forest and life near body of water it is a highly social specie and can be found in group a large a individual but usually life in group of individual the capybara is not a threatened specie but it is hunted for it meat and hide and also for grease from it thick fatty skin etymology it common name is derived from tupi a complex agglutination of kaa leaf pii slender u eat ara a suffix for agent noun meaning one who eats slender leaf or capybara were called several time cuartins in colombia in in eje cafetero alcala and near barranquilla where the meat wa offered a cuartin asado the scientific name both hydrochoerus and hydrochaeris come from greek udor hydor water and khoiros choiros pig hog classification and phylogeny the capybara and the lesser capybara belong to the subfamily hydrochoerinae along with the rock cavy the living capybara and their extinct relative were previously classified in their own family hydrochoeridae since molecular phylogenetic study have recognized a close relationship between hydrochoerus and kerodon the rock cavy supporting placement of both genus in a subfamily of caviidaepaleontological classification previously used hydrochoeridae for all capybara while using hydrochoerinae for the living genus and it closest fossil relative such a neochoerus but more recently have adopted the classification of hydrochoerinae within caviidae the taxonomy of fossil hydrochoerines is also in a state of flux in recent year the diversity of fossil hydrochoerines ha been substantially reduced this is largely due to the recognition that capybara molar teeth show strong variation in shape over the life of an individual in one instance material once referred to four genus and seven specie on the basis of difference in molar shape is now thought to represent differently aged individual of a single specie cardiatherium paranense among fossil specie the name capybara can refer to the many specie of hydrochoerinae that are more closely related to the modern hydrochoerus than to the cardiomyine rodent like cardiomys the fossil genus cardiatherium phugatherium hydrochoeropsis and neochoerus are all capybara under that concept description the capybara ha a heavy body and short head with fur on the upper part of it body that turn underneath it sweat gland can be found in the surface of the hairy portion of it skin an unusual trait among rodent the animal lack down hair and it guard hair differs little from over hairadult capybara grow to to cm to ft in length stand to cm to in tall at the withers and typically weigh to kg to lb with an average in the venezuelan llano of kg lb female are slightly heavier than male the top recorded weight are kg lb for a wild female from brazil and kg lb for a wild male from uruguay also an kg individual wa reported in sao paulo in or the dental formula is capybara have slightly webbed foot and vestigial tail their hind leg are slightly longer than their foreleg they have three toe on their rear foot and four toe on their front foot their muzzle are blunt with nostril and the eye and ear are near the top of their head it karyotype ha and fn ecology capybara are semiaquatic mammal found throughout almost all country of south america except chile they live in densely forested area near body of water such a lake river swamp pond and marsh a well a flooded savannah and along river in the tropical rainforest they are superb swimmer and can hold their breath underwater for up to five minute at a time capybara have flourished in cattle ranch they roam in home range averaging hectare acre in populationsmany escapee from captivity can also be found in similar watery habitat around the world sighting are fairly common in florida although a breeding population ha not yet been confirmed in one specimen wa spotted on the central coast of california diet and predation capybara are herbivore grazing mainly on grass and aquatic plant a well a fruit and tree bark they are very selective feeder and feed on the leaf of one specie and disregard other specie surrounding it they eat a greater variety of plant during the dry season a fewer plant are available while they eat grass during the wet season they have to switch to more abundant reed during the dry season plant that capybara eat during the summer lose their nutritional value in the winter so are not consumed at that time the capybara jaw hinge is not perpendicular so they chew food by grinding rather than capybara are autocoprophagous meaning they eat their own feces a a source of bacterial gut flora to help digest the cellulose in the grass that form their normal diet and to extract the maximum protein and vitamin from their food they may also regurgitate food to masticate again similar to by cattle a is the case with other rodent the front teeth of capybara grow continually to compensate for the constant wear from eating grass their cheek teeth also grow continuouslylike it relative the guinea pig the capybara doe not have the capacity to synthesize vitamin c and capybara not supplemented with vitamin c in captivity have been reported to develop gum disease a a sign of scurvythey can have a lifespan of year but live le than four year in the wild because they are a favourite food of jaguar puma ocelot eagle and caiman the capybara is also the preferred prey of the anaconda social organization capybara are known to be gregarious while they sometimes live solitarily they are more commonly found in group of around individual with two to four adult male four to seven adult female and the remainder juvenile capybara group can consist of a many a or individual during the dry season when the animal gather around available water source male establish social bond dominance or general group consensus they can make bark when threatened or when female are herding youngcapybaras have two type of scent gland a morrillo located on the snout and anal gland both sex have these gland but male have much larger morrillos and use their anal gland more frequently the anal gland of male are also lined with detachable hair a crystalline form of scent secretion is coated on these hair and is released when in contact with object such a plant these hair have a scent mark and are tasted by other capybara capybara by rubbing their morrillos on object or by walking over scrub and marking it with their anal gland capybara can spread their scent further by urinating however female usually mark without urinating and le frequently than male overall female mark more often during the wet season when they are in estrus in addition to object male also female reproduction when in estrus the female scent change subtly and nearby male begin pursuit in addition a female alert male she is in estrus by whistling through her nose during mating the female ha the advantage and mating choice capybara mate only in water and if a female doe not want to mate with a certain male she either submerges or leaf the water dominant male are highly protective of the female but they usually can not prevent some of the subordinate from copulating the larger the group the harder it is for the male to watch all the female dominant male secure significantly more mating than each subordinate but subordinate male a a class are responsible for more mating than each dominant male the lifespan of the capybara sperm is longer than that of other rodent capybara gestation is day and produce a litter of four capybara young on average but may produce between one and eight in a single litter birth is on land and the female rejoins the group within a few hour of delivering the newborn capybara which join the group a soon a they are mobile within a week the young can eat grass but continue to any female in the weaned around week the young form a group within the main group alloparenting ha been observed in this specie breeding peak between april and may in venezuela and between october and november in mato grosso brazil activity though quite agile on land capybara are equally at home in the water they are excellent swimmer and can remain completely submerged for up to five minute an ability they use to evade predator capybara can sleep in water keeping only their nose out of the water a temperature increase during the day they wallow in water and then graze during the late afternoon and early evening they also spend time wallowing in mud they rest around midnight and then continue to graze before dawn conservation and human interaction capybara are not considered a threatened specie their population is stable throughout most of their south american range though in some area hunting ha reduced their numberscapybaras are hunted for their meat and pelt in some area and otherwise killed by human who see their grazing a competition for livestock in some area they are farmed which ha the effect of ensuring the wetland habitat are protected their survival is aided by their ability to breed rapidlycapybaras have adapted well to urbanization in south america they can be found in many area in zoo and park and may live for year in captivity more than double their natural lifespan capybara are docile and usually allow human to pet and them but physical contact is normally discouraged a their tick can be vector to rocky mountain spotted feverthe european association of zoo and aquarium asked drusillas park in alfriston sussex england to keep the studbook for capybara to monitor captive population in europe the studbook includes information about all birth death and movement of capybara a well a how they are relatedcapybaras are farmed for meat and skin in south america the meat is considered unsuitable to eat in some area while in other area it is considered an important source of protein in part of south america especially in venezuela capybara meat is popular during lent and holy week a the catholic church previously issued special dispensation to allow it to be eaten while other meat are generally forbidden there is widespread perception in venezuela that consumption of capybara is exclusive to rural peoplealthough it is illegal in some state capybara are occasionally kept a pet in the united state the image of a capybara feature on the coin of uruguayin japan following the lead of izu shaboten park in multiple establishment or zoo in japan that raise capybara have adopted the practice of having them relax in onsen during the winter they are seen a an attraction by japanese people capybara became big in japan due to the popular cartoon character
