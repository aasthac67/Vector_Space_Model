crocodile subfamily crocodylinae or true crocodile are large semiaquatic reptile that live throughout the tropic in africa asia the america and australia crocodylinae all of whose member are considered true crocodile is classified a a biological subfamily a broader sense of the term crocodile crocodylidae that includes tomistoma is not used in this article the term crocodile here applies to only the specie within the subfamily of crocodylinae the term is sometimes used even more loosely to include all extant member of the order crocodilia which includes the alligator and caiman family alligatoridae the gharial and false gharial family gavialidae and all other living and fossil crocodylomorpha although they appear similar crocodile alligator and the gharial belong to separate biological family the gharial with it narrow snout is easier to distinguish while morphological difference are more difficult to spot in crocodile and alligator the most obvious external difference are visible in the head with crocodile having narrower and longer head with a more than a snout compared to alligator and caiman another obvious trait is that the upper and lower jaw of the crocodile are the same width and the teeth in the lower jaw fall along the edge or outside the upper jaw when the mouth is closed therefore all teeth are visible unlike an alligator which posse in the upper jaw small depression into which the lower teeth fit also when the crocodile mouth is closed the large fourth tooth in the lower jaw fit into a constriction in the upper jaw for specimen the protruding tooth is the most reliable feature to define the specie family crocodile have more webbing on the toe of the hind foot and can better tolerate saltwater due to specialized salt gland for filtering out salt which are present but in alligator another trait that separate crocodile from other crocodilian is their much higher level of aggressioncrocodile size morphology behaviour and ecology differ somewhat among specie however they have many similarity in these area a well all crocodile are semiaquatic and tend to congregate in freshwater habitat such a river lake wetland and sometimes in brackish water and saltwater they are carnivorous animal feeding mostly on vertebrate such a fish reptile bird and mammal and sometimes on invertebrate such a mollusc and crustacean depending on specie and age all crocodile are tropical specie that unlike alligator are very sensitive to cold they separated from other crocodilian during the eocene epoch about million year ago many specie are at the risk of extinction some being classified a critically endangered etymology the word crocodile come from the ancient greek krokodilos crocodilos lizard used in the phrase ho krokodilos tou potamou the lizard of the nile river there are several variant greek form of the word attested including the later form krokodeilos crocodeilos found cited in many english reference work in the koine greek of roman time crocodilos and crocodeilos would have been pronounced identically and either or both may be the source of the latinized form crocodilus used by the ancient roman it ha been suggested but it is not certain that the word crocodilos or crocodeilos is a compound of kroke pebble and worm although drilos is only attested a a colloquial term for penis it is ascribed to herodotus and supposedly describes the basking habit of the egyptian crocodilethe form crocodrillus is attested in medieval latin it is not clear whether this is a medieval corruption or derives from alternative form late greek corcodrillos and corcodrillion are attested a further corrupted form cocodrille is found in old french and wa borrowed into middle english a cocodril le the modern english form crocodile wa adapted directly from the classical latin crocodilus in the century replacing the earlier form the use of in the scientific name crocodylus and form derived from it is a corruption introduced by laurenti specie a total of extant specie have been recognized further genetic study is needed for the confirmation of proposed specie under the genus osteolaemus which is currently monotypic characteristic a crocodile physical trait allow it to be a successful predator it external morphology is a sign of it aquatic and predatory lifestyle it streamlined body enables it to swim swiftly it also tuck it foot to the side while swimming making it faster by decreasing water resistance crocodile have webbed foot which though not used to propel them through the water allow them to make fast turn and sudden move in the water or initiate swimming webbed foot are an advantage in shallow water where the animal sometimes move around by walking crocodile have a palatal flap a rigid tissue at the back of the mouth that block the entry of water the palate ha a special path from the nostril to the glottis that bypass the mouth the nostril are closed during submergence like other archosaur crocodilian are diapsid although their fenestra are reduced the wall of the braincase are bony but lack supratemporal and postfrontal bone their tongue are not free but held in place by a membrane that limit movement a a result crocodile are unable to stick out their tongue crocodile have smooth skin on their belly and side while their dorsal surface are armoured with large osteoderms the armoured skin ha scale and is thick and rugged providing some protection they are still able to absorb heat through this armour a a network of small capillary allows blood through the scale to absorb heat the osteoderms are highly vascularised and aid in calcium balance both to neutralize acid while the animal can not breathe underwater and to provide calcium for eggshell formation crocodilian scale have pore believed to be sensory in function analogous to the lateral line in fish they are particularly seen on their upper and lower jaw another possibility is that they are secretory a they produce an oily substance which appears to flush mud off size size greatly varies among specie from the dwarf crocodile to the saltwater crocodile specie of the dwarf crocodile osteolaemus grow to an adult size of just to m to ft whereas the saltwater crocodile can grow to size over m ft and weigh kg lb several other large specie can reach over m ft long and weigh over kg lb crocodilian show pronounced sexual dimorphism with male growing much larger and more rapidly than female despite their large adult size crocodile start their life at around cm in long the largest specie of crocodile is the saltwater crocodile found in eastern india northern australia throughout asia and in the surrounding water the brain volume of two adult crocodile wa for a spectacled caiman and for a larger nile crocodilethe largest crocodile ever held in captivity is a hybrid named yai thai meaning big born june at the samutprakarn crocodile farm and zoo thailand this animal measure m ft in length and weighs kg lb the longest crocodile captured alive wa lolong a saltwater crocodile which wa measured at m ft and weighed at kg lb by a national geographic team in agusan del sur province philippine teeth crocodile are polyphyodonts they are able to replace each of their teeth up to time in their to lifespan next to each tooth there is a small replacement tooth and an odontogenic stem cell in the dental lamina in standby that can be activated if required biology and behaviour crocodilian are more closely related to bird and dinosaur than to most animal classified a reptile the three family being included in the group archosauria reptile despite their prehistoric look crocodile are among the more biologically complex reptile unlike other reptile a crocodile ha a cerebral cortex and a heart crocodilian also have the functional equivalent of a diaphragm by incorporating muscle used for aquatic locomotion into respiration salt gland are present in the tongue of crocodile and they have a pore opening on the surface of the tongue a trait that separate them from alligator salt gland are dysfunctional in alligatoridae their function appears to be similar to that of salt gland in marine turtle crocodile do not have sweat gland and release heat through their mouth they often sleep with their mouth open and may pant like a dog four specie of freshwater crocodile climb tree to bask in area lacking a shoreline sens crocodile have acute sens an evolutionary advantage that make them successful predator the eye ear and nostril are located on top of the head allowing the crocodile to lie low in the water almost totally submerged and hidden from prey vision crocodile have very good night vision and are mostly nocturnal hunter they use the disadvantage of most prey animal poor nocturnal vision to their advantage the light receptor in crocodilian eye include cone and numerous rod so it is assumed all crocodilian can see colour crocodile have shaped pupil similar to those of domestic cat one explanation for the evolution of slit pupil is that they exclude light more effectively than a circular pupil helping to protect the eye during daylight on the rear wall of the eye is a tapetum lucidum which reflects incoming light back onto the retina thus utilizing the small amount of light available at night to best advantage in addition to the protection of the upper and lower eyelid crocodile have a nictitating membrane sometimes called a third that can be drawn over the eye from the inner corner while the lid are open the eyeball surface is thus protected under the water while a certain degree of vision is still possible olfaction crocodilian sense of smell is also very well developed aiding them to detect prey or animal carcass that are either on land or in water from far away it is possible that crocodile use olfaction in the egg prior to hatchingchemoreception in crocodile is especially interesting because they hunt in both terrestrial and aquatic surroundings crocodile have only one olfactory chamber and the vomeronasal organ is absent in the adult indicating all olfactory perception is limited to the olfactory system behavioural and olfactometer experiment indicate that crocodile detect both and chemical and use their olfactory system for hunting when above water crocodile enhance their ability to detect volatile odorants by gular pumping a rhythmic movement of the floor of the pharynx crocodile close their nostril when submerged so olfaction underwater is unlikely underwater food detection is presumably gustatory and tactile hearing crocodile can hear well their tympanic membrane are concealed by flat flap that may be raised or lowered by muscle touch cranial the upper and lower jaw are covered with sensory pit visible a small black speckle on the skin the crocodilian version of the lateral line organ seen in fish and many amphibian though arising from a completely different origin these pigmented nodule encase bundle of nerve fiber innervated beneath by branch of the trigeminal nerve they respond to the slightest disturbance in surface water detecting vibration and small pressure change a small a a single drop this make it possible for crocodile to detect prey danger and intruder even in total darkness these sense organ are known a domed pressure receptor dprs while alligator and caiman have dprs only on their jaw crocodile have similar organ on almost every scale on their body the function of the dprs on the jaw is clear to catch prey but it is still not clear what the function is of the organ on the rest of the body the receptor flatten when exposed to increased osmotic pressure such a that experienced when swimming in sea water hyperosmotic to the body fluid when contact between the integument and the surrounding sea water solution is blocked crocodile are found to lose their ability to discriminate salinity it ha been proposed that the flattening of the sensory organ in hyperosmotic sea water is sensed by the animal a touch but interpreted a chemical information about it surroundings this might be why in alligator they are absent on the rest of the body hunting and diet crocodile are ambush predator waiting for fish or land animal to come close then rushing out to attack crocodile mostly eat fish amphibian crustacean mollusc bird reptile and mammal and they occasionally cannibalize smaller crocodile what a crocodile eats varies greatly with specie size and age from the mostly specie like the and freshwater crocodile to the larger specie like the nile crocodile and the saltwater crocodile that prey on large mammal such a buffalo deer and wild boar diet show great diversity diet is also greatly affected by the size and age of the individual within the same specie all young crocodile hunt mostly invertebrate and small fish gradually moving on to larger prey being ectothermic predator they have a very slow metabolism so they can survive long period without food despite their appearance of being slow crocodile have a very fast strike and are top predator in their environment and various specie have been observed attacking and killing other predator such a shark and big cat crocodile are also known to be aggressive scavenger who feed upon carrion and steal from other predator evidence suggests that crocodile also feed upon fruit based on the discovery of seed in stool and stomach from many subject a well a account of them feedingcrocodiles have the most acidic stomach of any vertebrate they can easily digest bone hoof and horn the bbc tv reported that a nile crocodile that ha lurked a long time underwater to catch prey build up a large oxygen debt when it ha caught and eaten that prey it close it right aortic arch and us it left aortic arch to flush blood loaded with carbon dioxide from it muscle directly to it stomach the resulting excess acidity in it blood supply make it much easier for the stomach lining to secrete more stomach acid to quickly dissolve bulk of swallowed prey flesh and bone many large crocodilian swallow stone called gastroliths or stomach stone which may act a ballast to balance their body or assist in crushing food similar to grit ingested by bird herodotus claimed that nile crocodile had a symbiotic relationship with certain bird such a the egyptian plover which enter the crocodile mouth and pick leech feeding on the crocodile blood with no evidence of this interaction actually occurring in any crocodile specie it is most likely mythical or allegorical fiction bite since they feed by grabbing and holding onto their prey they have evolved sharp teeth for piercing and holding onto flesh and powerful muscle to close the jaw and hold them shut the teeth are not to tearing flesh off of large prey item a are the dentition and claw of many mammalian carnivore the hooked bill and talon of raptorial bird or the serrated teeth of shark however this is an advantage rather than a disadvantage to the crocodile since the property of the teeth allow it to hold onto prey with the least possibility of the prey animal escaping cutting teeth combined with the exceptionally high bite force would pas through flesh easily enough to leave an escape opportunity for prey the jaw can bite down with immense force by far the strongest bite of any animal the force of a large crocodile bite is more than lbf n which wa measured in a m ft nile crocodile in the field comparing to lbf n for a rottweiler lbf n for a hyena lbf n for an american alligator and lbf n for the largest confirmed great white shark a m ft long saltwater crocodile ha been confirmed a having the strongest bite force ever recorded for an animal in a laboratory setting it wa able to apply a bite force value of lbf n and thus surpassed the previous record of lbf n made by a m ft long american alligator taking the measurement of several m ft crocodile a reference the bite force of individual were estimated at lbf n the study led by dr gregory m erickson also shed light on the larger extinct specie of crocodilian since crocodile anatomy ha changed only slightly over the last million year current data on modern crocodilian can be used to estimate the bite force of extinct specie an ft deinosuchus would apply a force of lbf n nearly twice that of the latest higher bite force estimation of tyrannosaurus lbf n the extraordinary bite of crocodilian is a result of their anatomy the space for the jaw muscle in the skull is very large which is easily visible from the outside a a bulge at each side the muscle is so stiff it is almost a hard a bone to touch a if it were the continuum of the skull another trait is that most of the muscle in a crocodile jaw is arranged for clamping down despite the strong muscle to close the jaw crocodile have extremely small and weak muscle to open the jaw crocodile can thus be subdued for study or transport by taping their jaw or holding their jaw shut with large rubber band cut from automobile inner tube locomotion crocodile can move quickly over short distance even out of water the land speed record for a crocodile is mph measured in a galloping australian freshwater crocodile maximum speed varies between specie some specie can gallop including cuban crocodile johnston crocodile new guinea crocodile african dwarf crocodile and even small nile crocodile the fastest mean by which most specie can move is a belly run in which the body move in a sinusoidal fashion limb splayed out to either side paddling away frantically while the tail whip to and fro crocodile can reach speed of mph when they belly run and often faster if slipping down muddy riverbank when a crocodile walk quickly it hold it leg in a straighter and more upright position under it body which is called the high walk this walk allows a speed of up to may posse a homing instinct in northern australia three rogue saltwater crocodile were relocated km mi by helicopter but returned to their original location within three week based on data obtained from tracking device attached to them longevity measuring crocodile age is unreliable although several technique are used to derive a reasonable guess the most common method is to measure lamellar growth ring in bone and ring corresponds to a change in growth rate which typically occurs once a year between dry and wet season bearing these inaccuracy in mind it can be safely said that all crocodile specie have an average lifespan of at least year and in the case of larger specie an average of year the oldest crocodile appear to be the largest specie c porosus is estimated to live around year on average with limited evidence of some individual exceeding yearsin captivity some individual are claimed to have lived for over a century a male crocodile lived to an estimated age of year in a russian zoo in yekaterinburg named kolya he joined the zoo around to fully grown after touring in an animal show and lived until a male freshwater crocodile lived to an estimated age of year at the australia zoo known affectionately a mr freshie he wa rescued around by bob irwin and steve irwin after being shot twice by hunter and losing an eye a a result and lived until crocworld conservation centre in scottburgh south africa claim to have a male nile crocodile that wa born in named henry the crocodile is said to have lived in botswana along the okavango river according to centre director martin rodrigues social behaviour and vocalization crocodile are the most social of reptile even though they do not form social group many specie congregate in certain section of river tolerating each other at time of feeding and basking most specie are not highly territorial with the exception of the saltwater crocodile which is a highly territorial and aggressive specie a mature male saltwater crocodile will not tolerate any other male at any time of the year but most other specie are more flexible there is a certain form of hierarchy in crocodile the largest and heaviest male are at the top having access to the best basking site while female are priority during a group feeding of a big kill or carcass a good example of the hierarchy in crocodile would be the case of the nile crocodile this specie clearly display all of these behaviour study in this area are not thorough however and many specie are yet to be studied in greater detail mugger crocodile are also known to show toleration in group feeding and tend to congregate in certain area however male of all specie are aggressive towards each other during mating season to gain access to female crocodile are also the most vocal of all reptile producing a wide variety of sound during various situation and condition depending on specie age size and sex depending on the context some specie can communicate over different message through vocalization alone some of these vocalization are made during social communication especially during territorial display towards the same sex and courtship with the opposite sex the common concern being reproduction therefore most conspecific vocalization is made during the breeding season with the exception being territorial behaviour in some specie and quarrel during feeding crocodile also produce different distress call and in aggressive display to their own kind and other animal notably other predator during interspecific predatory confrontation over carcass and terrestrial kill specific vocalisation include chirp when about to hatch the young make a peeping noise which encourages the female to excavate the nest the female then gather the hatchling in her mouth and transport them to the water where they remain in a group for several month protected by the female distress call a call used mostly by younger animal to alert other crocodile to imminent danger or an animal being attacked threat call a hissing sound that ha also been described a a coughing noise hatching call emitted by a female when breeding to alert other crocodile that she ha laid egg in her nest bellowing male crocodile are especially vociferous bellowing chorus occur most often in the spring when breeding group congregate but can occur at any time of year to bellow male noticeably inflate a they raise the tail and head out of water slowly waving the tail back and forth they then puff out the throat and with a closed mouth begin to vibrate air just before bellowing male project an infrasonic signal at about hz through the water which vibrates the ground and nearby object these vibration travel great distance through both air and water to advertise the male presence and are so powerful they result in the water appearing to dance reproduction crocodile lay egg which are laid in either hole or mound nest depending on specie a hole nest is usually excavated in sand and a mound nest is usually constructed out of vegetation nesting period range from a few week up to six month courtship take place in a series of behavioural interaction that include a variety of snout rubbing and submissive display that can take a long time mating always take place in water where the pair can be observed mating several time female can build or dig several trial nest which appear incomplete and abandoned later usually take place at night and about minute female are highly protective of their nest and young the egg are hard shelled but translucent at the time of depending on the specie of crocodile to egg are laid crocodile embryo do not have sex chromosome and unlike human sex is not determined genetically sex is determined by temperature where at or le most hatchling are female and at offspring are of both sex a temperature of to to give mostly male whereas above in some specie continues to give male but in other specie resulting in female which are sometimes called female temperature also affect growth and survival rate of the young which may explain the sexual dimorphism in crocodile the average incubation period is around day and also is dependent on temperature and specie that usually range from to day the eggshell structure is very conservative through evolution but there are enough change to tell different specie apart by their eggshell microstructure scute may play a role in calcium storage for eggshell formationat the time of hatching the young start calling within the egg they have an at the tip of their snout which is developed from the skin and that help them pierce out of the shell hearing the call the female usually excavates the nest and sometimes take the unhatched egg in her mouth slowly rolling the egg to help the process the young is usually carried to the water in the mouth she would then introduce her hatchling to the water and even feed them the mother would then take care of her young for over a year before the next mating season in the absence of the mother crocodile the father would act in her place to take care of the young however even with a sophisticated parental nurturing young crocodile have a very high mortality rate due to their vulnerability to predation a group of hatchling is called a pod or creche and may be protected for month cognition crocodile posse some advanced cognitive ability they can observe and use pattern of prey behaviour such a when prey come to the river to drink at the same time each day vladimir dinets of the university of tennessee observed that crocodile use twig a bait for bird looking for nesting material they place stick on their snout and partly submerge themselves when the bird swooped in to get the stick the crocodile then catch the bird crocodile only do this in spring nesting season of the bird when there is high demand for stick to be used for building nest vladimir also discovered other similar observation from various scientist some dating back to the century aside from using stick crocodile are also capable of cooperative hunting large number of crocodile swim in circle to trap fish and take turn snatching them in hunting larger prey crocodile swarm in with one holding the prey down a the others rip it apart according to a study crocodile engage in all three main type of play behaviour recorded in animal locomotor play play with object and social play play with object is reported most often but locomotor play such a repeatedly sliding down slope and social play such a riding on the back of other crocodile is also reported this behaviour wa exhibited with conspecific and mammal and is apparently not uncommon though ha been difficult to observe and interpret in the past due to obvious danger of interacting with large carnivore taxonomy and phylogeny most specie are grouped into the genus crocodylus the other extant genus osteolaemus is monotypic a is mecistops if recognized subfamily crocodylinae genus crocodylus crocodylus acutus american crocodile crocodylus intermedius orinoco crocodile crocodylus johnsoni freshwater crocodile or johnstone crocodile crocodylus mindorensis philippine crocodile crocodylus moreletii morelet crocodile or mexican crocodile crocodylus niloticus nile crocodile or african crocodile the subspecies found in madagascar is sometimes called the black crocodile crocodylus novaeguineae new guinea crocodile crocodylus palustris mugger marsh or indian crocodile crocodylus porosus saltwater crocodile or estuarine crocodile crocodylus rhombifer cuban crocodile crocodylus siamensis siamese crocodile may be extinct in the wild crocodylus suchus west african crocodile desert or sacred crocodile genus osteolaemus osteolaemus tetraspis dwarf crocodile there ha been controversy a to whether or not this is actually two specie recent dna analysis indicate three distinct specie o tetraspis o osborni and a third currently unnamed genus mecistops mecistops cataphractus west african crocodile mecistops leptorhynchus central african crocodile genus genus formerly crocodylus lloydi genus brochu formerly crocodylus robustus phylogeny the cladogram below follows the topology from a analysis of morphological trait by christopher a brochu and glenn w storrs many extinct specie of crocodylus might represent different genus crocodylus pigotti for example wa placed in the newly erected genus brochuchus in c suchus wa not included because it morphological coding were identical to those of c niloticus however the author suggested that the lack of difference wa due to limited specimen sampling and considered the two specie to be distinct this analysis found weak support for the clade osteolaeminae brochu named osteolaeminae in a a subfamily of crocodylidae separate from crocodylinae but the group ha since been classified within crocodylinae it includes the living genus osteolaemus a well a the extinct specie voay robustus and rimasuchus lloydi a analysis by jack l conrad kirsten jenkins thomas lehmann and others did not support osteolaeminae a a true clade but rather a paraphyletic group consisting of two smaller clade they informally called these clade osteolaemins and mecistopins osteolaemins include osteolaemus voay rimasuchus and brochuchus and mecistopins include mecistops and euthecodon relationship with human danger to human the larger specie of crocodile are very dangerous to human mainly because of their ability to strike before the person can react the saltwater crocodile and nile crocodile are the most dangerous killing hundred of people each year in part of southeast asia and africa the mugger crocodile and american crocodile are also dangerous to human crocodile product crocodile are protected in many part of the world but are also farmed commercially their hide are tanned and used to make leather good such a shoe and handbag crocodile meat is also considered a delicacy the most commonly farmed specie are the saltwater and nile crocodile while a hybrid of the saltwater and the rare siamese crocodile is also bred in asian farm farming ha resulted in an increase in the saltwater crocodile population in australia a egg are usually harvested from the wild so landowner have an incentive to conserve their habitat crocodile leather can be made into good such a wallet briefcase purse handbag belt hat and shoe crocodile oil ha been used for various purpose crocodile were eaten by vietnamese while they were taboo and off limit for chinese vietnamese woman who married chinese men adopted the chinese taboo crocodile meat is consumed in some country such a australia ethiopia thailand south africa china and also cuba in pickled form it is also occasionally eaten a an exotic delicacy in the western world cut of meat include backstrap and tail fillet due to high demand for crocodile product traffic state that nile crocodile skin were exported from africa between and in religion crocodile have appeared in various form in religion across the world ancient egypt had sobek the god with his crocodilopolis a well a taweret the goddess of childbirth and fertility with the back and tail of a crocodile the jukun shrine in the wukari federation nigeria is dedicated to crocodile in thanks for their aid during migration in madagascar various people such a the sakalava and antandroy see crocodile a ancestor spirit and under local fady often offer them food in the case of the latter at least a crocodile feature prominently a an ancestor deitycrocodiles appear in different form in hinduism varuna a vedic and hindu god ride a makara his consort varuni ride a crocodile similarly the goddess personification of the ganga and yamuna river are often depicted a riding crocodile also in india in goa crocodile worship is practised including the annual mannge thapnee ceremonyin latin america cipactli wa the giant earth crocodile of the aztec and other nahua people crocodile tear the term crocodile tear and equivalent in other language refers to a false insincere display of emotion such a a hypocrite cry fake tear of grief it is derived from an ancient anecdote that crocodile weep in order to lure their prey or that they cry for the victim they are eating first told in the bibliotheca by photios i of constantinople the story is repeated in bestiary such a de bestiis et aliis rebus this tale wa first spread widely in english in the story of the travel of sir john mandeville in the century and appears in several of shakespeare play in fact crocodile can and do generate tear but they do not actually cry the surabaya shark and crocodile the name of surabaya indonesia is locally believed to be derived from the word suro shark and boyo crocodile two creature which in a local myth fought each other in order to gain the title of the strongest and most powerful animal in the area it wa said that the two powerful animal agreed for a truce and set boundary that the shark domain would be in the sea while the crocodile domain would be on the land however one day the shark swam into the river estuary to hunt this angered the crocodile who declared it his territory the shark argued that the river wa a which meant that it wa shark territory while the crocodile argued that the river flowed deep inland so it wa therefore crocodile territory a ferocious fight resumed a the two animal bit each other finally the shark wa badly bitten and fled to the open sea and the crocodile finally ruled the estuarine area that today is the cityanother source alludes to a jayabaya psychic king of kediri he foresaw a fight between a giant white shark and a giant white crocodile taking place in the area which is sometimes interpreted a a foretelling of the mongol invasion of java a major conflict between the force of the kublai khan mongol ruler of china and those of raden wijaya majapahit in the two animal are now used a the city symbol with the two facing and circling each other a depicted in a statue appropriately located near the entrance to the
