a gerbil is a small mammal of the subfamily gerbillinae in the order rodentia once known a desert rat the gerbil subfamily includes about specie of african indian and asian rodent including sand rat and jird all of which are adapted to arid habitat most are primarily active during the day making them diurnal but some specie including the common household pet exhibit crepuscular behavior and almost all are omnivorous gerbil are related to mouse and rat they all belong to the family muridae one mongolian specie meriones unguiculatus also known a the clawed jird is a gentle and hardy animal that ha become a popular small house pet it wa first brought from china to paris in the century it wa brought to the united state much later in by dr victor schwentker for use in research notably it is illegal to keep gerbil a pet in california and new zealand the gerbil got it name a a diminutive form of jerboa an unrelated group of rodent occupying a similar ecological niche gerbil are typically between and mm and in long including the tail which make up about half of their total length one specie the great gerbil rhombomys opimus originally native to turkmenistan can grow to more than mm in the average adult gerbil weighs about gram ounce behavior gerbil are social animal and live in group in the wild they rely on their sense of smell to identify other member of their clan so it is important to use what is commonly referred to a the split tank method when introducing gerbil from separate litter gerbil are known to attack and often kill those carrying an unfamiliar scent a pet gerbil were first introduced to the pet industry in these were mongolian gerbil meriones unguiculatus their value a pet wa soon appreciated and they are now found in pet shop throughout the united kingdom and the united state however due to the threat they pose to indigenous ecosystem and existing agricultural operation it is illegal to purchase import or keep a gerbil a a pet in the u state of california it is also illegal to import the animal into new zealand housing in captivity a common misunderstanding when purchasing a home for pet gerbil is they can live in housing designed for hamster and mouse this is not correct a they need to be able to dig tunnel system rather than have them created for them the commonly plastic structure of hamster and mouse cage is inappropriate for gerbil due to their ability to gnaw through it very quickly plastic can cause serious health issue for the animal if ingested therefore many owner refrain from having any plastic in the tank and rely entirely on wooden toy information from gerbil society from throughout the globe is conflicting with regard to tank sizing however a common minimum given appears to be litre imperial gallon per gerbil mating gerbil will mate for several hour in frequent short burst followed by short chase when the female allows the male to catch her once he catch her the female will squeak and make flick motion to get the male off her male will not attack female except in rare circumstance which may also include them having been separated from their original mate or widowed a female may attack a male but usually he is more than a match for her reason for popularity the several reason for the popularity of gerbil a household pet include the animal are typically not aggressive and they rarely bite unprovoked or without stress they are small and easy to handle since they are sociable creature that enjoy the company of human and other gerbil gerbil also have adapted their kidney to produce a minimum of waste to conserve body fluid which make them very clean with little odor health concern teeth problem misalignment of incisor due to injury or malnutrition may result in overgrowth which can cause injury to the roof of the mouth symptom include a dropped or loss of appetite drooling weight loss or foul breath the teeth must be clipped by a veterinarian regularly for a long a required trauma common injury are caused by gerbil being dropped or falling often while inside of a hamster ball which can cause broken limb or a fractured spine for which there is no cure neglect a common problem for all small rodent is neglect which can cause the gerbil to not receive adequate food and water causing serious health concern including dehydration starvation stomach ulcer eating of bedding material and cannibalism epilepsy between and of all pet gerbil have the seizure disorder epilepsy the seizure are thought to be caused by fright handling or a new environment the attack can be mild to severe but do not typically appear to have any effect except for rare case where death result from very severe seizure a way to prevent a gerbil from having a seizure is to refrain from blowing in the animal face often used to train the pet not to bite this technique is used in a lab environment to induce seizure for medical research tumor tumor both benign and malignant are fairly common in pet gerbil and are most common in female over the age of two usually the tumor involve the ovary causing an extended abdomen or the skin with tumor most often developing around the ear foot midabdomen and base of the tail appearing a a lump or abscess the scent gland positioned on the abdomen should be checked regularly a veterinarian can operate on the lump where possible tail sloughing gerbil can lose their tail due to improper handling being attacked by another animal or getting their tail stuck the first sign is a loss of fur from the tip of the tail then the skinless tail dy off and slough with the stump usually healing without complication tyzzer disease the most common infectious disease in gerbil is tyzzer disease a bacterial disease which stress can make animal more susceptible to it produce symptom such a ruffled fur lethargy hunched posture poor appetite diarrhoea and often death it quickly spread between gerbil in close contact deafness and inner ear problem a problem with the inner ear can be spotted by a gerbil leaning to one side quite obviously the fluid in the ear affect balance however this doe not appear to affect the gerbil too much which have an attitude of just getting on with thing and getting used to their condition gerbil with extreme white spotting colouring are susceptible to deafness this is thought to be due to the lack of pigmentation in and around the ear gerbil many color variety of gerbil are available in pet shop today generally the result of year of selective breeding over different coat color occur in the mongolian gerbil which ha been the longestanother specie of gerbil ha also been recently introduced to the pet industry the gerbil or duprasi they are smaller than the common mongolian gerbil and have long soft coat and short fat tail appearing more like a hamster the variation on the normal duprasi coat is more gray in color which may be a mutation or it may be the result of hybrid between the egyptian and algerian subspecies of duprasiwhite spotting ha been reported in not only the mongolian gerbil but also the pallid gerbil and possibly sundervall jirda mutation a grey agouti or chinchilla mutation white spotting and possibly a dilute mutation have also appeared in shaw jird and white spotting and a dilute mutation have shown up in jird classification subfamily gerbillinae
