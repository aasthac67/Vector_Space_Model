bee are flying insect closely related to wasp and ant known for their role in pollination and in the case of the bee specie the western honey bee for producing honey bee are a monophyletic lineage within the superfamily apoidea they are presently considered a clade called anthophila there are over known specie of bee in seven recognized biological family some specie including honey bee bumblebee and stingless bee live socially in colony while some specie including mason bee carpenter bee leafcutter bee and sweat bee are solitary bee are found on every continent except for antarctica in every habitat on the planet that contains flowering plant the most common bee in the northern hemisphere are the halictidae or sweat bee but they are small and often mistaken for wasp or fly bee range in size from tiny stingless bee specie whose worker are le than millimetre in long to megachile pluto the largest specie of leafcutter bee whose female can attain a length of millimetre in bee feed on nectar and pollen the former primarily a an energy source and the latter primarily for protein and other nutrient most pollen is used a food for their larva vertebrate predator of bee include bird such a insect predator include beewolves and dragonfly bee pollination is important both ecologically and commercially and the decline in wild bee ha increased the value of pollination by commercially managed hive of honey bee the analysis of wild bee and hoverfly specie across britain from to found the insect have been lost from a quarter of the place they inhabited in beekeeping or apiculture ha been practised for millennium since at least the time of ancient egypt and ancient greece bee have appeared in mythology and folklore through all phase of art and literature from ancient time to the present day although primarily focused in the northern hemisphere where beekeeping is far more common evolution the ancestor of bee were wasp in the family crabronidae which were predator of other insect the switch from insect prey to pollen may have resulted from the consumption of prey insect which were flower visitor and were partially covered with pollen when they were fed to the wasp larva this same evolutionary scenario may have occurred within the vespoid wasp where the pollen wasp evolved from predatory ancestor until recently the oldest bee fossil had been found in new jersey amber cretotrigona prisca of cretaceous age a corbiculate bee a bee fossil from the early cretaceous mya melittosphex burmensis is considered an extinct lineage of apoidea sister to the modern bee derived feature of it morphology apomorphies place it clearly within the bee but it retains two unmodified ancestral trait plesiomorphies of the leg two spur and a slender hind basitarsus showing it transitional status by the eocene mya there wa already considerable diversity among eusocial bee lineagesthe highly eusocial corbiculate apidae appeared roughly mya and the allodapini within the apidae around mya the colletidae appear a fossil only from the late oligocene mya to early miocene the melittidae are known from palaeomacropis eocenicus in the early eocene the megachilidae are known from trace fossil characteristic leaf cutting from the middle eocene the andrenidae are known from the boundary around mya of the florissant shale the halictidae first appear in the early eocene with specie found in amber the stenotritidae are known from fossil brood cell of pleistocene age coevolution the earliest flower were shallow bloom pollinated by insect such a beetle so the syndrome of insect pollination wa well established before the first appearance of bee the novelty is that bee are specialized a pollination agent with behavioral and physical modification that specifically enhance pollination and are the most efficient pollinating insect in a process of coevolution flower developed floral reward such a nectar and longer tube and bee developed longer tongue to extract the nectar bee also developed structure known a scopal hair and pollen basket to collect and carry pollen the location and type differ among and between group of bee most specie have scopal hair on their hind leg or on the underside of their abdomen some specie in the family apidae have pollen basket on their hind leg while very few lack these and instead collect pollen in their crop the appearance of these structure drove the adaptive radiation of the angiosperm and in turn bee themselves bee coevolved not only with flower but it is believed that some specie coevolved with mite some provide tuft of hair called acarinaria that appear to provide lodging for mite in return it is believed that mite eat fungi that attack pollen so the relationship in this case may be mutualistc phylogeny external this phylogenetic tree is based on debevic et al which used molecular phylogeny to demonstrate that the bee anthophila arose from deep within the crabronidae which is therefore paraphyletic the placement of the heterogynaidae is uncertain the small subfamily mellininae wa not included in this analysis internal this cladogram of the bee family is based on hedtke et al which place the former family dasypodaidae and meganomiidae a subfamily inside the melittidae english name where available are given in parenthesis characteristic bee differ from closely related group such a wasp by having branched or seta hair comb on the forelimb for cleaning their antenna small anatomical difference in limb structure and the venation of the hind wing and in female by having the seventh dorsal abdominal plate divided into two have the following characteristic a pair of large compound eye which cover much of the surface of the head between and above these are three small simple eye ocellus which provide information on light intensity the antenna usually have segment in male and in female and are geniculate having an elbow joint part way along they house large number of sense organ that can detect touch mechanoreceptors smell and taste and small hairlike mechanoreceptors that can detect air movement so a to hear sound the mouthpart are adapted for both chewing and sucking by having both a pair of mandible and a long proboscis for sucking up nectar the thorax ha three segment each with a pair of robust leg and a pair of membranous wing on the hind two segment the front leg of corbiculate bee bear comb for cleaning the antenna and in many specie the hind leg bear pollen basket flattened section with incurving hair to secure the collected pollen the wing are synchronised in flight and the somewhat smaller hind wing connect to the forewing by a row of hook along their margin which connect to a groove in the forewing the abdomen ha nine segment the hindermost three being modified into the sting the largest specie of bee is thought to be wallace giant bee megachile pluto whose female can attain a length of millimetre in the smallest specie may be dwarf stingless bee in the tribe meliponini whose worker are le than millimetre in in length sociality haplodiploid breeding system according to inclusive fitness theory organism can gain fitness not just through increasing their own reproductive output but also that of close relative in evolutionary term individual should help relative when cost relatedness benefit the requirement for eusociality are more easily fulfilled by haplodiploid specie such a bee because of their unusual relatedness structurein haplodiploid specie female develop from fertilized egg and male from unfertilized egg because a male is haploid ha only one copy of each gene his daughter which are diploid with two copy of each gene share of his gene and of their mother therefore they share of their gene with each other this mechanism of sex determination give rise to what w d hamilton termed supersisters more closely related to their sister than they would be to their own offspring worker often do not reproduce but they can pas on more of their gene by helping to raise their sister a queen than they would by having their own offspring each of which would only have of their gene assuming they would produce similar number this unusual situation ha been proposed a an explanation of the multiple at least evolution of eusociality within hymenopterahaplodiploidy is neither necessary nor sufficient for eusociality some eusocial specie such a termite are not haplodiploid conversely all bee are haplodiploid but not all are eusocial and among eusocial specie many queen mate with multiple male creating that share only of gene but monogamy queen mating singly is the ancestral state for all eusocial specie so far investigated so it is likely that haplodiploidy contributed to the evolution of eusociality in bee eusociality bee may be solitary or may live in various type of community eusociality appears to have originated from at least three independent origin in halictid bee the most advanced of these are specie with eusocial colony these are characterised by cooperative brood care and a division of labour into reproductive and adult plus overlapping generation this division of labour creates specialized group within eusocial society which are called caste in some specie group of cohabiting female may be sister and if there is a division of labour within the group they are considered semisocial the group is called eusocial if in addition the group consists of a mother the queen and her daughter worker when the caste are purely behavioural alternative with no morphological differentiation other than size the system is considered primitively eusocial a in many paper wasp when the caste are morphologically discrete the system is considered highly eusocialtrue honey bee genus apis of which seven specie are currently recognized are highly eusocial and are among the best known insect their colony are established by swarm consisting of a queen and several hundred worker there are subspecies of one of these specie apis mellifera native to europe the middle east and africa africanized bee are a hybrid strain of a mellifera that escaped from experiment involving crossing european and african subspecies they are extremely defensivestingless bee are also highly eusocial they practise mass provisioning with complex nest architecture and perennial colony also established via swarming many bumblebee are eusocial similar to the eusocial vespidae such a hornet in that the queen initiate a nest on her own rather than by swarming bumblebee colony typically have from to bee at peak population which occurs in mid to late summer nest architecture is simple limited by the size of the nest cavity and colony rarely last more than a year in the international union for conservation of nature set up the bumblebee specialist group to review the threat status of all bumblebee specie worldwide using the iucn red list criteriathere are many more specie of primitively eusocial than highly eusocial bee but they have been studied le often most are in the family halictidae or sweat bee colony are typically small with a dozen or fewer worker on average queen and worker differ only in size if at all most specie have a single season colony cycle even in the tropic and only mated female hibernate a few specie have long active season and attain colony size in the hundred such a halictus hesperus some specie are eusocial in part of their range and solitary in others or have a mix of eusocial and solitary nest in the same population the orchid bee apidae include some primitively eusocial specie with similar biology some allodapine bee apidae form primitively eusocial colony with progressive provisioning a larva food is supplied gradually a it develops a is the case in honey bee and some bumblebee solitary and communal bee most other bee including familiar insect such a carpenter bee leafcutter bee and mason bee are solitary in the sense that every female is fertile and typically inhabits a nest she construct herself there is no division of labor so these nest lack queen and worker bee for these specie solitary bee typically produce neither honey nor beeswax bee collect pollen to feed their young and have the necessary adaptation to do this however certain wasp specie such a pollen wasp have similar behaviour and a few specie of bee scavenge from carcase to feed their offspring solitary bee are important pollinator they gather pollen to provision their nest with food for their brood often it is mixed with nectar to form a consistency some solitary bee have advanced type of structure on their body very few specie of solitary bee are being cultured for commercial pollination most of these specie belong to a distinct set of genus which are commonly known by their nesting behavior or preference namely carpenter bee sweat bee mason bee plasterer bee squash bee dwarf carpenter bee leafcutter bee alkali bee and digger bee most solitary bee nest in the ground in a variety of soil texture and condition while others create nest in hollow reed or twig hole in wood the female typically creates a compartment a cell with an egg and some provision for the resulting larva then seal it off a nest may consist of numerous cell when the nest is in wood usually the last those closer to the entrance contain egg that will become male the adult doe not provide care for the brood once the egg is laid and usually dy after making one or more nest the male typically emerge first and are ready for mating when the female emerge solitary bee are either stingless or very unlikely to sting only in if ever while solitary female each make individual nest some specie such a the european mason bee hoplitis anthocopoides and the dawson burrowing bee amegilla dawsoni are gregarious preferring to make nest near others of the same specie and giving the appearance of being social large group of solitary bee nest are called aggregation to distinguish them from colony in some specie multiple female share a common nest but each make and provision her own cell independently this type of group is called communal and is not uncommon the primary advantage appears to be that a nest entrance is easier to defend from predator and parasite when there are multiple female using that same entrance on a regular basis biology life cycle the life cycle of a bee be it a solitary or social specie involves the laying of an egg the development through several moult of a legless larva a pupation stage during which the insect undergoes complete metamorphosis followed by the emergence of a winged adult most solitary bee and bumble bee in temperate climate overwinter a adult or pupa and emerge in spring when increasing number of flowering plant come into bloom the male usually emerge first and search for female with which to mate the sex of a bee is determined by whether or not the egg is fertilised after mating a female store the sperm and determines which sex is required at the time each individual egg is laid fertilised egg producing female offspring and unfertilised egg male tropical bee may have several generation in a year and no diapause stagethe egg is generally oblong slightly curved and tapering at one end solitary bee lay each egg in a separate cell with a supply of mixed pollen and nectar next to it this may be rolled into a pellet or placed in a pile and is known a mass provisioning social bee specie provision progressively that is they feed the larva regularly while it grows the nest varies from a hole in the ground or in wood in solitary bee to a substantial structure with wax comb in bumblebee and honey beesin most specie larva are whitish grub roughly oval and at both end they have segment and spiracle in each segment for breathing they have no leg but move within the cell helped by tubercle on their side they have short horn on the head jaw for chewing food and an appendage on either side of the mouth tipped with a bristle there is a gland under the mouth that secretes a viscous liquid which solidifies into the silk they use to produce a cocoon the cocoon is and the pupa can be seen through it over the course of a few day the larva undergoes metamorphosis into a winged adult when ready to emerge the adult split it skin dorsally and climb out of the exuviae and break out of the cell flight antoine magnan book le vol de insectes say that he and andre had applied the equation of air resistance to insect and found that their flight could not be explained by calculation but that one should be surprised that the result of the calculation do square with reality this ha led to a common misconception that bee violate aerodynamic theory in fact it merely confirms that bee do not engage in flight and that their flight is explained by other mechanic such a those used by helicopter in it wa shown that vortex created by many insect wing helped to provide lift cinematography and robotic of a bee wing showed that lift wa generated by the unconventional combination of short choppy wing stroke a rapid rotation of the wing a it flop over and revers direction and a very fast frequency frequency normally increase a size decrease but a the bee wing beat cover such a small arc it flap approximately time per second faster than a fruitfly time per second which is time smaller navigation communication and finding food the ethologist karl von frisch studied navigation in the honey bee he showed that honey bee communicate by the waggle dance in which a worker indicates the location of a food source to other worker in the hive he demonstrated that bee can recognize a desired compass direction in three different way by the sun by the polarization pattern of the blue sky and by the earth magnetic field he showed that the sun is the preferred or main compass the other mechanism are used under cloudy sky or inside a dark beehive bee navigate using spatial memory with a rich organization digestion the gut of bee is relatively simple but multiple metabolic strategy exist in the gut microbiota pollinating bee consume nectar and pollen which require different digestion strategy by somewhat specialized bacteria while nectar is a liquid of mostly monosaccharide sugar and so easily absorbed pollen contains complex polysaccharide branching pectin and hemicellulose approximately five group of bacteria are involved in digestion three group specialize in simple sugar snodgrassella and two group of lactobacillus and two other group in complex sugar gilliamella and bifidobacterium digestion of pectin and hemicellulose is dominated by bacterial clade gilliamella and bifidobacterium respectively bacteria that can not digest polysaccharide obtain enzyme from their neighbor and bacteria that lack certain amino acid do the same creating multiple ecological nichesalthough most bee specie are nectarivorous and palynivorous some are not particularly unusual are vulture bee in the genus trigona which consume carrion and wasp brood turning meat into a substance ecology floral relationship most bee are polylectic generalist meaning they collect pollen from a range of flowering plant but some are oligoleges specialist in that they only gather pollen from one or a few specie or genus of closely related plant specialist pollinator also include bee specie which gather floral oil instead of pollen and male orchid bee which gather aromatic compound from orchid one of the few case where male bee are effective pollinator bee are able to sense the presence of desirable flower through ultraviolet patterning on flower floral odor and even electromagnetic field once landed a bee then us nectar quality and pollen taste to determine whether to continue visiting similar flower in rare case a plant specie may only be effectively pollinated by a single bee specie and some plant are endangered at least in part because their pollinator is also threatened but there is a pronounced tendency for oligolectic bee to be associated with common widespread plant visited by multiple pollinator specie for example the creosote bush in the arid part of the united state southwest is associated with some oligoleges a mimic and model many bee are aposematically coloured typically orange and black warning of their ability to defend themselves with a powerful sting a such they are model for batesian mimicry by insect such a robber fly and hoverflies all of which gain a measure of protection by superficially looking and behaving like beesbees are themselves mullerian mimic of other aposematic insect with the same colour scheme including wasp lycid and other beetle and many butterfly and moth lepidoptera which are themselves distasteful often through acquiring bitter and poisonous chemical from their plant food all the mullerian mimic including bee benefit from the reduced risk of predation that result from their easily recognised warning colorationbees are also mimicked by plant such a the bee orchid which imitates both the appearance and the scent of a female bee male bee attempt to mate pseudocopulation with the furry lip of the flower thus pollinating it a brood parasite brood parasite occur in several bee family including the apid subfamily nomadinae female of these specie lack pollen collecting structure the scopa and do not construct their own nest they typically enter the nest of pollen collecting specie and lay their egg in cell provisioned by the host bee when the cuckoo bee larva hatch it consumes the host larva pollen ball and often the host egg also in particular the arctic bee specie bombus hyperboreus is an aggressive specie that attack and enslaves other bee of the same subgenus however unlike many other bee brood parasite they have pollen basket and often collect pollenin southern africa hive of african honeybee a mellifera scutellata are being destroyed by parasitic worker of the cape honeybee a m capensis these lay diploid egg thelytoky escaping normal worker policing leading to the colony destruction the parasite can then move to other hivesthe cuckoo bee in the bombus subgenus psithyrus are closely related to and resemble their host in look and size this common pattern gave rise to the ecological principle emery rule others parasitize bee in different family like townsendiella a nomadine apid two specie of which are cleptoparasites of the dasypodaid genus hesperapis while the other specie in the same genus attack halictid bee nocturnal bee four bee family andrenidae colletidae halictidae and apidae contain some specie that are crepuscular most are tropical or subtropical but some live in arid region at higher latitude these bee have greatly enlarged ocellus which are extremely sensitive to light and dark though incapable of forming image some have refracting superposition compound eye these combine the output of many element of their compound eye to provide enough light for each retinal photoreceptor their ability to fly by night enables them to avoid many predator and to exploit flower that produce nectar only or also at night predator parasite and pathogen vertebrate predator of bee include shrike and flycatcher which make short sally to catch insect in flight swift and swallow fly almost continually catching insect a they go the honey buzzard attack bee nest and eats the larva the greater honeyguide interacts with human by guiding them to the nest of wild bee the human break open the nest and take the honey and the bird feed on the larva and the wax among mammal predator such a the badger dig up bumblebee nest and eat both the larva and any stored food specialist ambush predator of visitor to flower include crab spider which wait on flowering plant for pollinating insect predatory bug and praying mantis some of which the flower mantis of the tropic wait motionless aggressive mimic camouflaged a flower beewolves are large wasp that habitually attack bee the ethologist niko tinbergen estimated that a single colony of the beewolf philanthus triangulum might kill several thousand honeybee in a day all the prey he observed were honeybee other predatory insect that sometimes catch bee include robber fly and dragonfly honey bee are affected by parasite including acarine and varroa mite however some bee are believed to have a mutualistic relationship with mite relationship with human in mythology and folklore homer hymn to hermes describes three with the power of divination and thus speaking truth and identifies the food of the god a honey source associated the bee maiden with apollo and until the scholar followed gottfried hermann in incorrectly identifying the with the thriae honey according to a greek myth wa discovered by a nymph called melissa bee and honey wa offered to the greek god from mycenean time bee were also associated with the delphic oracle and the prophetess wa sometimes called a beethe image of a community of honey bee ha been used from ancient to modern time in aristotle and plato in virgil and seneca in erasmus and shakespeare tolstoy and by political and social theorist such a bernard mandeville and karl marx a a model for human society in english folklore bee would be told of important event in the household in a custom known a telling the bee in art and literature some of the oldest example of bee in art are rock painting in spain which have been dated to bcw b yeats poem the lake isle of innisfree contains the couplet nine bean row will i have there a hive for the honey bee and live alone in the bee loud glade at the time he wa living in bedford park in the west of london

tell the tale of a hive bee named flora from hatching onwards beekeeping human have kept honey bee colony commonly in hive for millennium beekeeper collect honey beeswax propolis pollen and royal jelly from hive bee are also kept to pollinate crop and to produce bee for sale to other beekeeper depiction of human collecting honey from wild bee date to year ago effort to domesticate them are shown in egyptian art around year ago simple hive and smoke were used jar of honey were found in the tomb of pharaoh such a tutankhamun from the century european understanding of the colony and biology of bee allowed the construction of the moveable comb hive so that honey could be harvested without destroying the colony among classical era author beekeeping with the use of smoke is described in aristotle history of animal book the account mention that bee die after stinging that worker remove corps from the hive and guard it caste including worker and drone but king rather than queen predator including toad and and the waggle dance with the irresistible suggestion of aposeiontai aroseiontai it waggle and parakolouthousin parakolouthousin they watch beekeeping is described in detail by virgil in his eclogue it is also mentioned in his aeneid and in pliny natural history a commercial pollinator bee play an important role in pollinating flowering plant and are the major type of pollinator in many ecosystem that contain flowering plant it is estimated that one third of the human food supply depends on pollination by insect bird and bat most of which is accomplished by bee whether wild or domesticated over the last half century there ha been a general decline in the specie richness of wild bee and other pollinator probably attributable to stress from increased parasite and disease the use of pesticide and a general decrease in the number of wild flower climate change probably exacerbates the problemcontract pollination ha overtaken the role of honey production for beekeeper in many country after the introduction of varroa mite feral honey bee declined dramatically in the u though their number have since recovered the number of colony kept by beekeeper declined slightly through urbanization systematic pesticide use tracheal and varroa mite and the closure of beekeeping business in and the rate of attrition increased and wa described a colony collapse disorder in invertebrate iridescent virus and the fungus nosema ceranae were shown to be in every killed colony and deadly in combination winter loss increased to about varroa mite were thought to be responsible for about half the lossesapart from colony collapse disorder loss outside the u have been attributed to cause including pesticide seed dressing using neonicotinoids such a clothianidin imidacloprid and thiamethoxam from the european union restricted some pesticide to stop bee population from declining further in the intergovernmental panel on climate change report warned that bee faced increased risk of extinction because of global warming in the european union decided to ban field use of all three major neonicotinoids they remain permitted in veterinary greenhouse and vehicle transport usagefarmers have focused on alternative solution to mitigate these problem by raising native plant they provide food for native bee pollinator like lasioglossum vierecki and l leucozonium leading to le reliance on honey bee population a food producer honey is a natural product produced by bee and stored for their own use but it sweetness ha always appealed to human before domestication of bee wa even attempted human were raiding their nest for their honey smoke wa often used to subdue the bee and such activity are depicted in rock painting in spain dated to bchoney bee are used commercially to produce honey they also produce some substance used a dietary supplement with possible health benefit pollen propolis and royal jelly though all of these can also cause allergic reaction a food bee brood bee are partly considered edible insect indigenous people in many country eat insect including the larva and pupa of bee mostly stingless specie they also gather larva pupa and surrounding cell known a bee brood for consumption in the indonesian dish botok tawon from central and east java bee larva are eaten a a companion to rice after being mixed with shredded coconut wrapped in banana leaf and steamedbee brood pupa and larva although low in calcium ha been found to be high in protein and carbohydrate and a useful source of phosphorus magnesium potassium and trace mineral iron zinc copper and selenium in addition while bee brood wa high in fat it contained no fat soluble vitamin such a a d and e but it wa a good source of most of the including choline a well a vitamin c the fat wa composed mostly of saturated and monounsaturated fatty acid with being polyunsaturated fatty acid a alternative medicine apitherapy is a branch of alternative medicine that us honey bee product including raw honey royal jelly pollen propolis beeswax and apitoxin bee venom the claim that apitherapy treat cancer which some proponent of apitherapy make remains unsupported by medicine sting the painful sting of bee are mostly associated with the poison gland and the dufour gland which are abdominal exocrine gland containing various chemical in lasioglossum leucozonium the dufour gland mostly contains octadecanolide a well a some eicosanolide there is also evidence of and however the secretion of these gland could also be used for nest construction see also australian
