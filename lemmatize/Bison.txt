bison are large ungulate in the genus bison within the subfamily bovinae two extant and six extinct specie are recognised of the six extinct specie five became extinct in the quaternary extinction event bison palaeosinensis evolved in the early pleistocene in south asia and wa the evolutionary ancestor of b priscus steppe bison which wa the ancestor of all other bison specie from million year ago to bc steppe bison ranged across the mammoth steppe inhabiting europe and northern asia with b schoetensacki woodland bison and north america with b antiquus b latifrons and b occidentalis the last specie to go extinct b occidentalis wa succeeded at bc by b bison of the two surviving specie the american bison b bison found only in north america is the more numerous although commonly known a a buffalo in the united state and canada it is only distantly related to the true buffalo the north american specie is composed of two subspecies the plain bison b b bison and the wood bison b b athabascae which is the namesake of wood buffalo national park in canada a third subspecies the eastern bison b b pennsylvanicus is no longer considered a valid taxon being a junior synonym of b b bison reference to wood bison or wood bison from the eastern united state confusingly refer to this subspecies not b b athabascae which wa not found in the region the european bison b bonasus or wisent is found in europe and the caucasus reintroduced after being extinct in the wild while all bison specie are classified in their own genus they are sometimes bred with domestic cattle genus bos and produce sometimes fertile offspring called beefalo or zubron description the american bison and the european bison wisent are the largest surviving terrestrial animal in north america and europe they are typical artiodactyl cloven hooved ungulate and are similar in appearance to other bovine such a cattle and true buffalo they are broad and muscular with shaggy coat of long hair adult grow up to metre foot inch in height and m ft in in length for american bison and up to m ft in in height and m ft in in length for european bison american bison can weigh from around to kilogram to pound and european bison can weigh from to kg to lb european bison tend to be taller than american bison bison are nomadic grazers and travel in herd the bull leave the herd of female at two or three year of age and join a herd of male which are generally smaller than female herd mature bull rarely travel alone towards the end of the summer for the reproductive season the sex necessarily commingleamerican bison are known for living in the great plain but formerly had a much larger range including much of the eastern united state and part of mexico both specie were hunted close to extinction during the and century but have since rebounded the wisent owing it survival in part to the chernobyl disaster a the chernobyl exclusion zone ha become a kind of wildlife preserve for wisent and other rare megafauna such a the przewalski horse though poaching ha become a threat in recent year the american plain bison is no longer listed a endangered but this doe not mean the specie is secure genetically pure b b bison currently number only about separated into fragmented of which require active conservation measure the wood bison is on the endangered specie list in canada and is listed a threatened in the united state though numerous attempt have been made by beefalo rancher to have it entirely removed from the endangered specie list although superficially similar physical and behavioural difference exist between the american and european bison the american specie ha rib while the european bison ha the american bison ha four lumbar vertebra while the european ha five the difference in this case is that what would be the first lumbar vertebra ha rib attached to it in american bison and is thus counted a the thoracic vertebra compared to thoracic vertebra in wisent adult american bison are le slim in build and have shorter leg american bison tend to graze more and browse le than their european relative their anatomy reflect this behavioural difference the american bison head hang lower than the european the body of the american bison is typically hairier though it tail ha le hair than that of the european bison the horn of the european bison point through the plane of their face making them more adept at fighting through the interlocking of horn in the same manner a domestic cattle unlike the american bison which favour butting american bison are more easily tamed than their european cousin and breed with domestic cattle more readily evolution and genetic history the bovine tribe bovini split about to million year ago into the buffalo bubalus and syncerus and a group leading to bison and taurine cattle thereafter the family lineage of bison and taurine cattle doe not appear to be a straightforward tree structure a is often depicted in much evolution because evidence of interbreeding and crossbreeding is seen between different specie and member within this family even many million of year after their ancestor separated into different specie this crossbreeding wa not sufficient to conflate the different specie back together but it ha resulted in unexpected relationship between many member of this group such a yak being related to american bison when such relationship would otherwise not be apparent a study of mitochondrial dna indicated four distinct maternal lineage in tribe bovini taurine cattle and zebu wisent american bison and yak and banteng gaur and gayalhowever y chromosome analysis associated wisent and american bison an earlier study using amplified fragment length polymorphism fingerprinting showed a close association of wisent with american bison and probably with the yak but noted that the interbreeding of bovini specie made determining relationship problematicthe genus bison diverged from the lineage that led to cattle bos primigenius at the boundary in south asia two extant and six extinct specie are recognised of the six extinct specie five went extinct in the quaternary extinction event three were north american endemic bison antiquus b latifrons and b occidentalis the fourth b priscus steppe bison ranged across steppe environment from western europe through central asia east asia including japan and onto north america the fifth b schoetensacki woodland bison inhabited eurasian forest extending from western europe to the south of siberia the sixth b palaeosinensis evolving in the early pleistocene in south asia is presumed to have been the evolutionary ancestor of b priscus and all successive bison lineage the steppe bison b priscus evolved from bison palaeosinensis in the early pleistocene b priscus is seen clearly in the fossil record around million year ago the steppe bison spread across eurasia and all proceeding contemporary and successive specie are believed to have derived from the steppe bison going extinct around bce in siberia and around bce in alaska outlasted only by b occidentalis b bonasus and b bison the steppe bison wa the predominant bison pictured in the ancient cave painting of spain and southern france the modern european bison is likely to have arisen from the steppe bison there is no direct fossil evidence of successive specie between the steppe bison and the european bison though there are three possible line of ancestry pertaining to the european wisent past research ha suggested that the european bison is descended from bison that had migrated from asia to north america and then back to europe where they crossbred with existing steppe bison however more recent phylogenetic research point to an origin either from the phenotypically and genetically similar pleistocene woodland bison b schoetensacki or a the result of an interbreeding event between the steppe bison and the aurochs bos primigenius the ancestor of domesticated cattle around year ago the possible hybrid is referred to in vernacular a the bison a a to the discovery process of the higgs bosonat one point some steppe bison crossbred with the ancestor of the modern yak after that crossbreeding a population of steppe bison crossed the bering land bridge to north america the steppe bison spread through the northern part of north america and lived in eurasia until around year ago and north america until to year agothe pleistocene woodland bison b schoetensacki evolved in the middle pleistocene from b priscus and tended to inhabit the dry conifer forest and woodland which lined the mammoth steppe occupying a range from western europe to the south of siberia although their fossil record are far rarer than their antecedent they are thought to have existed until at least bcebison latifrons the giant or longhorn bison is thought to have evolved in midcontinent north america from b priscus after the steppe bison crossed into north america giant bison b latifrons appeared in the fossil record about year ago b latifrons wa one of many specie of north american megafauna that became extinct during the transition from the pleistocene to the holocene epoch an event referred to a the quaternary extinction event it is thought to have disappeared some year ago during the late wisconsin glaciationb latifrons with the slightly smaller b antiquus for over year their predecessor the steppe bison appeared in the north american fossil record around year ago b latifrons is believed to have been a more specie while b antiquus wa a herding very much like it descendant b bison b antiquus gave rise to both b occidentalis and later b bison the modern american bison some to year ago b antiquus wa the most common megafaunal specie on the north american continent during much of the late pleistocene and is the most commonly found large animal found at the la brea tar pitsin dna extracted from bison priscus fossil remains beneath a volcanic ashfall in the yukon suggested recent arrival of the specie that genetic material indicated that all american bison had a common ancestor to year ago during which period the bering land bridge wa exposed this hypothesis precludes an earlier arrival the researcher sequenced mitochondrial genome from both that specimen and from the remains of a recently discovered estimated giant b latifrons from snowmass colorado the genetic information also indicated that a second pleistocene migration of bison over the land bridge occurred to year ago during the population bottleneck after the great slaughter of american bison during the century the number of bison remaining alive in north america declined to a low a during that period a handful of rancher gathered remnant of the existing herd to save the specie from extinction these rancher bred some of the bison with cattle in an effort to produce cattleo today called beefalo accidental crossing were also known to occur generally male domestic bull were crossed with buffalo cow producing offspring of which only the female were fertile the crossbred animal did not demonstrate any form of hybrid vigor so the practice wa abandoned bison hybrid were briefly experimented with in germany and found to be fully fertile and a herd of such animal is maintained in russia a herd of crossbreed zubron is maintained in poland cross do not occur naturally requiring caesarean delivery male are infertile the u national bison association ha adopted a code of ethic that prohibits it member from deliberately crossbreeding bison with any other specie in the united state many rancher are now using dna testing to cull the residual cattle genetics from their bison herd the proportion of cattle dna that ha been measured in introgressed individual and bison herd today is typically quite low ranging from to there are also remnant purebred american bison herd on public land in north america herd of importance are found in yellowstone national park wind cave national park in south dakota blue mound state park in minnesota elk island national park in alberta and grassland national park in saskatchewan in a purebred herd of individual wa identified on public land in the henry mountain of southern utah via genetic testing of mitochondrial and nuclear dna this study published in also showed the henry mountain bison herd to be free of brucellosis a bacterial disease that wa imported with domestic cattle to north america behavior wallowing is a common behavior of bison a bison wallow is a shallow depression in the soil either wet or dry bison roll in these depression covering themselves with mud or dust possible explanation suggested for wallowing behavior include grooming behavior associated with moulting interaction typically rutting behavior social behavior for group cohesion play behavior relief from skin irritation due to biting insect reduction of ectoparasite load tick and louse and thermoregulation in the process of wallowing bison may become infected by the fatal disease anthrax which may occur naturally in the soilbison temperament is often unpredictable they usually appear peaceful unconcerned even lazy yet they may attack anything often without warning or apparent reason they can move at speed up to mph and cover long distance at a lumbering galloptheir most obvious weapon are the horn borne by both male and female but their massive head can be used a battering ram effectively using the momentum produced by what is a typical weight of to kilogram to lb moving at mph the hind leg can also be used to kill or maim with devastating effect in the word of early naturalist they were dangerous savage animal that feared no other animal and in prime condition could best any foe except for wolf and brown bear the rutting or mating season last from june through september with peak activity in july and august at this time the older bull rejoin the herd and fight often take place between bull the herd exhibit much restlessness during breeding season the animal are belligerent unpredictable and most dangerous habitat american bison live in river valley and on prairie and plain typical habitat is open or semiopen grassland a well a sagebrush semiarid land and scrubland some lightly wooded area are also known historically to have supported bison they also graze in hilly or mountainous area where the slope are not steep though not particularly known a animal bison in the yellowstone park bison herd are frequently found at elevation above foot and the henry mountain bison herd is found on the plain around the henry mountain utah a well a in mountain valley of the henry mountain to an altitude of foot european bison most commonly live in lightly wooded to fully wooded area a well a area with increased shrub and bush european bison can be found living on grassland and plain a well but are not a common restriction throughout most of their historical range landowner have sought restriction on bison herd on private land are required to be fenced in in the state of montana bison on public land may be shot due to concern about transmission of disease to cattle and damage to public property in montana legislative measure concerning the bison were proposed and passed the legislature but opposed by native american tribe a they impinged on sovereign tribal right three such bill were vetoed by steve bullock the governor of montana the bison circumstance remain an issue of contention between native american tribe and private landowner diet bison are ruminant which give them the ability to ferment plant in a specialized stomach prior to digesting them bison were once thought to almost exclusively consume grass and sedge but are now known to consume a of plant including woody plant and herbaceous eudicots over the course of the year bison shift which plant they select in their diet based on which plant have the highest protein or energy concentration at a given time and will reliably consume the same specie of plant across year protein concentration of the plant they eat tend to be highest in the spring and decline thereafter reaching their lowest in the winter in yellowstone national park bison browsed willow and cottonwood not only in the winter when few other plant are available but also in the summer bison are thought to migrate to optimize their diet and will concentrate their feeding on recently burned area due to the higher quality forage the regrows after the burn wisent tend to browse on shrub and tree more often than do the american bison which prefer grass to shrubbery and tree reproduction female bison typically do not reproduce until three year of age and can reproduce to at least year of age female bison can produce calf annually a long a their nutrition is sufficient but will not give birth to a calf after year where weight gain wa too low a mother probability of reproduction the following year is strongly dependent on the mother mass and age heavier female bison produce heavier calf weighed in the fall at weaning than light mother while the weight of calf is lower for older mother after age predator owing to their size bison have few predator five notable exception are human grey wolf cougar brown bear and coyote the grey wolf generally take down a bison while in a pack but case of a single wolf killing bison have been reported brown bear also consume bison often by driving off the pack and consuming the wolf kill brown bear and coyote also prey on bison calf historically and prehistorically lion tiger the dire wolf smilodon homotherium cave hyena and homo sp had posed threat to bison infection and illness for the american bison the main cause of illness is malignant catarrhal fever though brucellosis is a serious concern in the yellowstone park bison herd bison in the antelope island bison herd are regularly inoculated against brucellosis parasite clostridium infection infectious bovine rhinotracheitis and bovine vibriosisthe major concern for illness in european bison are disease and balanoposthitis which affect the male sex organ a number of parasitic disease have also been cited a threat the inbreeding of the specie caused by the small population play a role in a number of genetic defect and immunity to disease which in turn pose greater risk to the population name the term buffalo is sometimes considered to be a misnomer for this animal a it is only distantly related to either of the two true buffalo the asian water buffalo and the african buffalo samuel de champlain applied the term buffalo buffles in french to the bison in published after seeing skin and a drawing shown to him by member of the nipissing first nation who said they travelled day from east of lake huron to trade with another nation who hunted the animal though bison might be considered more scientifically correct a a result of standard usage buffalo is also considered correct and is listed in many dictionary a an acceptable name for american buffalo or bison buffalo ha a much longer history than bison which wa first recorded in human impact bison wa a significant resource for indigenous people of north america for food and raw material until near extinction in the late century in fact for the indigenous people of the plain it wa their principal food source native american highly valued their relationship with the bison saw them a sacred and treated them in such a respectful way a to ensure their ongoing longevity and abundance in his biography lakota teacher and elder john fire lame deer describes the relationship a such the buffalo gave u everything we needed without it we were nothing our tipi were made of his skin his hide wa our bed our blanket our winter coat it wa our drum throbbing through the night alive holy out of his skin we made our water bag his flesh strengthened u became flesh of our flesh not the smallest part of it wa wasted his stomach a stone dropped into it became our soup kettle his horn were our spoon the bone our knife our woman awl and needle out of his sinew we made our bowstring and thread his rib were fashioned into sled for our child his hoof became rattle his mighty skull with the pipe leaning against it wa our sacred altar the name of the greatest of all sioux wa tatanka bull when you killed off the buffalo you also killed the real natural wild indian human notably european settler were almost exclusively accountable for the of the american bison in the at the beginning of the century ten of million of bison roamed north america pioneer and settler slaughtered an estimated million bison during the century although the cause of decline and the number killed are disputed and debated railroad were advertising hunting by rail where train encountered large herd alongside or crossing the track men aboard fired from the train roof or window leaving countless animal to rot where they died this overhunting wa in part motivated by the u government desire to limit the range and power of indigenous plain indian whose diet and culture depended on the buffalo herd the overhunting of the bison reduced their population to hundred attempt to revive the american bison have been highly successful farming ha increased their population to nearly the american bison is therefore no longer considered an endangered specie however most of these animal are actually hybrid with domestic cattle and only two population in yellowstone national park usa and elk island canada are genetically pure bisonas of july an estimated bison lived in yellowstone national park the largest u bison population on public land during visitor experienced injury range so the park implemented education campaign after year of success five injury associated with bison encounter occurred in because visitor did not maintain the required distance of ft m from bison while hiking or taking picture nutrition bison is an excellent source of complete protein and a rich source or more of the daily value dv of multiple vitamin including riboflavin niacin vitamin and vitamin and is also a rich source of mineral including iron phosphorus and zinc additionally bison is a good source or more of the dv of thiamine livestock the earliest plausible account of captive bison are those of the zoo at tenochtitlan the aztec capital which held an animal the spaniard called the mexican bull in francisco lopez de gomara described plain indian herding and leading bison like cattle in his controversial book historia general de la india gomara having never visited the america himself likely misinterpreted early ethnographic account a the more familiar pastoralist relationship of the old world today bison are increasingly raised for meat hide wool and dairy product the majority of bison in the world are raised for human consumption or fur clothing bison meat is generally considered to taste very similar to beef but is lower in fat and cholesterol yet higher in protein than beef which ha led to the development of beefalo a fertile hybrid of bison and domestic cattle a market even exists for kosher bison meat these bison are slaughtered at one of the few kosher mammal slaughterhouse in the u and canada and the meat is then distributed worldwidein america the commercial industry for bison ha been slow to develop despite individual such a ted turner who have long marketed bison meat in the turner found limited success with restaurant for cut of meat which include bison steak and tenderloin cut suitable for hamburger and hot dog have been described a almost nonexistent this created a marketing problem for commercial farming because the majority of usable meat about pound for each bison is suitable for these product in the united state department of agriculture purchased million worth of frozen overstock to save the industry which would later recover through better use of consumer marketing restaurant have played a role in popularizing bison meat like ted montana grill which added bison to their menu ruby tuesday first offered bison on their menu in canada commercial bison farming began in the concerning an unknown number of animal then the first census of the bison occurred in which recorded bison on farm and grew to bison on farm for the censusseveral pet food company use bison a a red meat alternative in dog food the company producing these formula include natural balance pet food freshpet the blue buffalo company solid gold canidae and taste of the wild see also bison hunting
