a dragonfly is an insect belonging to the order odonata infraorder anisoptera from greek anisos anisos unequal and pteron pteron wing because the hindwing is broader than the forewing adult dragonfly are characterized by large multifaceted eye two pair of strong transparent wing sometimes with coloured patch and an elongated body dragonfly can be mistaken for the related group damselfly zygoptera which are similar in structure though usually lighter in build however the wing of most dragonfly are held flat and away from the body while damselfly hold the wing folded at rest along or above the abdomen dragonfly are agile flier while damselfly have a weaker fluttery flight many dragonfly have brilliant iridescent or metallic colour produced by structural coloration making them conspicuous in flight an adult dragonfly compound eye have nearly ommatidium each fossil of very large dragonfly ancestor in the protodonata are found from million year ago mya in upper carboniferous rock these had wingspan up to about mm in there are about extant specie most are tropical with fewer specie in temperate region loss of wetland habitat threatens dragonfly population around the world dragonfly are predator both in their aquatic larval stage when they are known a nymph or naiad and a adult several year of their life are spent a nymph living in fresh water the adult may be on the wing for just a few day or week they are fast agile flier sometimes migrating across ocean and often live near water they have a uniquely complex mode of reproduction involving indirect insemination delayed fertilization and sperm competition during mating the male grasp the female at the back of the head and the female curl her abdomen under her body to pick up sperm from the male secondary genitalia at the front of his abdomen forming the heart or wheel posture dragonfly are represented in human culture on artifact such a pottery rock painting statue and art nouveau jewelry they are used in traditional medicine in japan and china and caught for food in indonesia they are symbol of courage strength and happiness in japan but seen a sinister in european folklore their bright colour and agile flight are admired in the poetry of lord tennyson and the prose of h e bates phylogeny dragonfly and their relative are an ancient group the oldest fossil are of the protodonata from the mya upper carboniferous of europe a group that included the largest insect that ever lived meganeuropsis permiana from the early permian with a wingspan around mm in their fossil record end with the extinction event about mya the protanisoptera another ancestral group which lack certain wing vein character found in modern odonata lived from the early to late permian age until the end permian event and are known from fossil wing from current day united state russia and australia suggesting they might have been cosmopolitan in distribution the forerunner of modern odonata are included in a clade called the panodonata which include the basal zygoptera damselfly and the anisoptera true dragonfly today there are some specie extant around the worldthe relationship of anisopteran family are not fully resolved a of but all the family are monophyletic except the corduliidae the gomphidae are a sister taxon to all other anisoptera the austropetaliidae are sister to the aeshnoidea and the chlorogomphidae are sister to a clade that includes the synthemistidae and libellulidae on the cladogram dashed line indicate unresolved relationship english name are given in parenthesis distribution and diversity about specie of dragonfly were known in these are classified into genus in family the distribution of diversity within the region are summarized below the world number are not ordinary total a overlap in specie occur dragonfly live on every continent except antarctica in contrast to the damselfly zygoptera which tend to have restricted distribution some genus and specie are spread across continent for example the darner rhionaeschna multicolor life all across north america and in central america emperor anax live throughout the america from a far north a newfoundland to a far south a bahia blanca in argentina across europe to central asia north africa and the middle east the globe skimmer pantala flavescens is probably the most widespread dragonfly specie in the world it is cosmopolitan occurring on all continent in the warmer region most anisoptera specie are tropical with far fewer specie in temperate regionssome dragonfly including libellulids and aeshnids live in desert pool for example in the mojave desert where they are active in shade temperature between and to these insect were able to survive body temperature above the thermal death point of insect of the same specie in cooler placesdragonflies live from sea level up to the mountain decreasing in specie diversity with altitude their altitudinal limit is about m represented by a specie of aeshna in the pamirsdragonflies become scarce at higher latitude they are not native to iceland but individual are occasionally swept in by strong wind including a hemianax ephippiger native to north africa and an unidentified darter specie in kamchatka only a few specie of dragonfly including the treeline emerald somatochlora arctica and some aeshnids such a aeshna subarctica are found possibly because of the low temperature of the lake there the treeline emerald also life in northern alaska within the arctic circle making it the most northerly of all dragonfly general description dragonfly suborder anisoptera are insect that hold their wing horizontally both in flight and at rest by contrast damselfly suborder zygoptera have slender body and fly more weakly most specie fold their wing over the abdomen when stationary and the eye are well separated on the side of the headan adult dragonfly ha three distinct segment the head thorax and abdomen a in all insect it ha a chitinous exoskeleton of hard plate held together with flexible membrane the head is large with very short antenna it is dominated by the two compound eye which cover most of it surface the compound eye are made up of ommatidium the number being greater in the larger specie aeshna interrupta ha ommatidium of two varying size being large the facet facing downward tend to be smaller petalura gigantea ha ommatidium of just one size these facet provide complete vision in the frontal hemisphere of the dragonfly the compound eye meet at the top of the head except in the petaluridae and gomphidae a also in the genus epiophlebia also they have three simple eye or ocellus the mouthpart are adapted for biting with a toothed jaw the labrum at the front of the mouth can be shot rapidly forward to catch prey the head ha a system for locking it in place that consists of muscle and small hair on the back of the head that grip structure on the front of the first thoracic segment this arrester system is unique to the odonata and is activated when feeding and during tandem flight the thorax consists of three segment a in all insect the prothorax is small and is flattened dorsally into a disc which ha two transverse ridge the mesothorax and metathorax are fused into a rigid structure with internal bracing and provides a robust attachment for the powerful wing muscle inside it the thorax bear two pair of wing and three pair of leg the wing are long veined and membranous narrower at the tip and wider at the base the hindwings are broader than the forewing and the venation is different at the base the vein carry haemolymph which is analogous to blood in vertebrate and carry out many similar function but which also serf a hydraulic function to expand the body between nymphal stage instar and to expand and stiffen the wing after the adult emerges from the final nymphal stage the leading edge of each wing ha a node where other vein join the marginal vein and the wing is able to flex at this point in most large specie of dragonfly the wing of female are shorter and broader than those of male the leg are rarely used for walking but are used to catch and hold prey for perching and for climbing on plant each ha two short basal joint two long joint and a foot armed with a pair of claw the long leg joint bear row of spine and in male one row of spine on each front leg is modified to form an eyebrush for cleaning the surface of the compound eye the abdomen is long and slender and consists of segment there are three terminal appendage on segment a pair of superior claspers and an inferior the second and third segment are enlarged and in male on the underside of the second segment ha a cleft forming the secondary genitalia consist of lamina hamule genital lobe and penis there are remarkable variation in the presence and the form of the penis and the related structure the flagellum cornu and genital lobe sperm is produced at the segment and is transferred to the secondary genitalia prior to mating the male hold the female behind the head using a pair of claspers on the terminal segment in female the genital opening is on the underside of the eighth segment and is covered by a simple flap vulvar lamina or an ovipositor depending on specie and the method of dragonfly having simple flap shed the egg in water mostly in flight dragonfly having ovipositor use it to puncture soft tissue of plant and place the egg singly in each puncture they madedragonfly nymph vary in form with specie and are loosely classed into claspers sprawler hiders and burrowers the first instar is known a a prolarva a relatively inactive stage from which it quickly moult into the more active nymphal form the general body plan is similar to that of an adult but the nymph lack wing and reproductive organ the lower jaw ha a huge extensible labium armed with hook and spine which is used for catching prey this labium is folded under the body at rest and struck out at great speed by hydraulic pressure created by the abdominal muscle whereas damselfly nymph have three feathery external gill dragonfly nymph have internal gill located around the fourth and fifth abdominal segment water is pumped in and out of the abdomen through an opening at the tip the naiad of some clubtails gomphidae that burrow into the sediment have a tube at the end of the abdomen enabling them to draw in clean water while they are buried in mud naiad can forcefully expel a jet of water to propel themselves with great rapidity coloration many adult dragonfly have brilliant iridescent or metallic colour produced by structural coloration making them conspicuous in flight their overall coloration is often a combination of yellow red brown and black pigment with structural colour blue are typically created by microstructures in the cuticle that reflect blue light green often combine a structural blue with a yellow pigment freshly emerged adult known a tenerals are often and obtain their typical colour after a few day some have their body covered with a pale blue waxy powderiness called pruinosity it wear off when scraped during mating leaving darker area some dragonfly such a the green darner anax junius have a noniridescent blue which is produced structurally by scatter from array of tiny sphere in the endoplasmic reticulum of epidermal cell underneath the cuticlethe wing of dragonfly are generally clear apart from the dark vein and pterostigmata in the chaser libellulidae however many genus have area of colour on the wing for example groundling brachythemis have brown band on all four wing while some scarlet crocothemis and dropwings trithemis have bright orange patch at the wing base some aeshnids such a the brown hawker aeshna grandis have translucent pale yellow wingsdragonfly nymph are usually a blend of dull brown green and grey biology ecology dragonfly and damselfly are predatory both in the aquatic nymphal and adult stage nymph feed on a range of freshwater invertebrate and larger one can prey on tadpole and small fish adult capture insect prey in the air making use of their acute vision and highly controlled flight the mating system of dragonfly is complex and they are among the few insect group that have a system of indirect sperm transfer along with sperm storage delayed fertilization and sperm competitionadult male vigorously defend territory near water these area provide suitable habitat for the larva to develop and for female to lay their egg swarm of feeding adult aggregate to prey on swarming prey such a emerging flying ant or termite dragonfly a a group occupy a considerable variety of habitat but many specie and some family have their own specific environmental requirement some specie prefer flowing water while others prefer standing water for example the gomphidae clubtails live in running water and the libellulidae skimmer live in still water some specie live in temporary water pool and are capable of tolerating change in water level desiccation and the resulting variation in temperature but some genus such a sympetrum darter have egg and larva that can resist drought and are stimulated to grow rapidly in warm shallow pool also often benefiting from the absence of predator there vegetation and it characteristic including submerged floating emergent or waterside are also important adult may require emergent or waterside plant to use a perch others may need specific submerged or floating plant on which to lay egg requirement may be highly specific a in aeshna viridis green hawker which life in swamp with the stratiotes aloides the chemistry of the water including it trophic status degree of enrichment with nutrient and ph can also affect it use by dragonfly most specie need moderate condition not too eutrophic not too acid a few specie such a sympetrum danae black darter and libellula quadrimaculata chaser prefer acidic water such a peat bog while others such a libellula fulva scarce chaser need eutrophic water with reed or similar waterside plant behaviour many dragonfly particularly male are territorial some defend a territory against others of their own specie some against other specie of dragonfly and a few against insect in unrelated group a particular perch may give a dragonfly a good view over an feeding ground male of many specie such a the pachydiplax longipennis blue dasher jostle other dragonfly to maintain the right to alight there defending a breeding territory is common among male dragonfly especially in specie that congregate around pond the territory contains desirable feature such a a sunlit stretch of shallow water a special plant specie or the preferred substrate for the territory may be small or large depending on it quality the time of day and the number of competitor and may be held for a few minute or several hour dragonfly including tramea lacerata black saddlebag may notice landmark that assist in defining the boundary of the territory landmark may reduce the cost of territory establishment or might serve a a spatial reference some dragonfly signal ownership with striking colour on the face abdomen leg or wing the plathemis lydia common whitetail dash towards an intruder holding it white abdomen aloft like a flag other dragonfly engage in aerial dogfight or chase a female must mate with the territory holder before laying her egg there is also conflict between the male and female female may sometimes be harassed by male to the extent that it affect their normal activity including foraging and in some dimorphic specie female have evolved multiple form with some form appearing deceptively like male in some specie female have evolved behavioural response such a feigning death to escape the attention of male similarly selection of habitat by adult dragonfly is not random and terrestrial habitat patch may be held for up to month a specie tightly linked to it birth site utilises a foraging area that is several order of magnitude larger than the birth site reproduction mating in dragonfly is a complex precisely choreographed process first the male ha to attract a female to his territory continually driving off rival male when he is ready to mate he transfer a packet of sperm from his primary genital opening on segment near the end of his abdomen to his secondary genitalia on segment near the base of his abdomen the male then grasp the female by the head with the claspers at the end of his abdomen the structure of the claspers varies between specie and may help to prevent interspecific mating the pair fly in tandem with the male in front typically perching on a twig or plant stem the female then curl her abdomen downwards and forward under her body to pick up the sperm from the male secondary genitalia while the male us his tail claspers to grip the female behind the head this distinctive posture is called the heart or wheel the pair may also be described a being in cop ovipositing involves not only the female darting over floating or waterside vegetation to deposit egg on a suitable substrate but also the male hovering above her or continuing to clasp her and flying in tandem the male attempt to prevent rival from removing his sperm and inserting their own something made possible by delayed fertilisation and driven by sexual selection if successful a rival male us his penis to compress or scrape out the sperm inserted previously this activity take up much of the time that a copulating pair remains in the heart posture flying in tandem ha the advantage that le effort is needed by the female for flight and more can be expended on and when the female submerges to deposit egg the male may help to pull her out of the take two different form depending on the specie the female in some family ha a ovipositor with which she slit open a stem or leaf of a plant on or near the water so she can push her egg inside in other family such a clubtails gomphidae cruiser macromiidae emerald corduliidae and skimmer libellulidae the female lay egg by tapping the surface of the water repeatedly with her abdomen by shaking the egg out of her abdomen a she fly along or by placing the egg on vegetation in a few specie the egg are laid on emergent plant above the water and development is delayed until these have withered and become immersed life cycle dragonfly are hemimetabolous insect they do not have a pupal stage and undergo an incomplete metamorphosis with a series of nymphal stage from which the adult emerges egg laid inside plant tissue are usually shaped like grain of rice while other egg are the size of a pinhead ellipsoidal or nearly spherical a clutch may have a many a egg and they take about a week to hatch into aquatic nymph or naiad which moult between six and time depending on specie a they grow most of a dragonfly life is spent a a nymph beneath the water surface the nymph extends it hinged labium a toothed mouthpart similar to a lower mandible which is sometimes termed a a mask a it is normally folded and held before the face that can extend forward and retract rapidly to capture prey such a mosquito larva tadpole and small fish they breathe through gill in their rectum and can rapidly propel themselves by suddenly expelling water through the anus some naiad such a the later stage of antipodophlebia asthenes hunt on land the larval stage of dragonfly last up to five year in large specie and between two month and three year in smaller specie when the naiad is ready to metamorphose into an adult it stop feeding and make it way to the surface generally at night it remains stationary with it head out of the water while it respiration system adapts to breathing air then climb up a reed or other emergent plant and moult ecdysis anchoring itself firmly in a vertical position with it claw it skin begin to split at a weak spot behind the head the adult dragonfly crawl out of it larval skin the exuvia arching backwards when all but the tip of it abdomen is free to allow it exoskeleton to harden curling back upwards it completes it emergence swallowing air which plump out it body and pumping haemolymph into it wing which cause them to expand to their full extentdragonflies in temperate area can be categorized into two group an early group and a later one in any one area individual of a particular spring specie emerge within a few day of each other the springtime darner basiaeschna janata for example is suddenly very common in the spring but disappears a few week later and is not seen again until the following year by contrast a summer specie emerges over a period of week or month later in the year they may be seen on the wing for several month but this may represent a whole series of individual with new adult hatching out a earlier one complete their lifespan sex ratio the sex ratio of male to female dragonfly varies both temporally and spatially adult dragonfly have a high ratio at breeding habitat the ratio ha contributed partially to the female using different habitat to avoid male harassment a seen in hine emerald dragonfly somatochlora hineana male population use wetland habitat while female use dry meadow and marginal breeding habitat only migrating to the wetland to lay their egg or to find mating partner unwanted mating is energetically costly for female because it affect the amount of time that they are able to spend foraging flight dragonfly are powerful and agile flier capable of migrating across the sea moving in any direction and changing direction suddenly in flight the adult dragonfly can propel itself in six direction upward downward forward backward to left and to right they have four different style of flight a number of flying mode are used that include with forewing beating out of phase with the hindwings is used for hovering and slow flight this style is efficient and generates a large amount of lift with the hindwings beating ahead of the forewing is used for fast flight this style creates more thrust but le lift than with forewing and hindwings beating together is used when changing direction rapidly a it maximises thrust and gliding with the wing held out is used in three situation free gliding for a few second in between burst of powered flight gliding in the updraft at the crest of a hill effectively hovering by falling at the same speed a the updraft and in certain dragonfly such a darter when in cop with a male the female sometimes simply glide while the male pull the pair along by beating his wing the wing are powered directly unlike most family of insect with the flight muscle attached to the wing base dragonfly have a high ratio and have been documented accelerating at g linearly and g in sharp turn while pursuing preydragonflies generate lift in at least four way at different time including classical lift like an aircraft wing supercritical lift with the wing above the critical angle generating high lift and using very short stroke to avoid stalling and creating and shedding vortex some family appear to use special mechanism a for example the libellulidae which take off rapidly their wing beginning pointed far forward and twisted almost vertically dragonfly wing behave highly dynamically during flight flexing and twisting during each beat among the variable are wing curvature length and speed of stroke angle of attack position of wing and phase relative to the other wing flight speed old and unreliable claim are made that dragonfly such a the southern giant darner can fly up to mph however the greatest reliable flight speed record are for other type of insect in general large dragonfly like the hawker have a maximum speed of mph with average cruising speed of about mph dragonfly can travel at per second in forward flight and three length per second backwards motion camouflage in territorial battle between male australian emperor hemianax papuensis the fighting dragonfly adjust their flight path to appear stationary to their rival minimizing the chance of being detected a they approach to achieve the effect the attacking dragonfly fly towards his rival choosing his path to remain on a line between the rival and the start of his attack path the attacker thus loom larger a he close on the rival but doe not otherwise appear to move researcher found that six of encounter involved motion camouflage temperature control the flight muscle need to be kept at a suitable temperature for the dragonfly to be able to fly being they can raise their temperature by basking in the sun early in the morning they may choose to perch in a vertical position with the wing outstretched while in the middle of the day a horizontal stance may be chosen another method of warming up used by some larger dragonfly is a rapid vibration of the wing that cause heat to be generated in the flight muscle the green darner anax junius is known for it migration and often resort to before dawn to enable it to make an early startbecoming too hot is another hazard and a sunny or shady position for perching can be selected according to the ambient temperature some specie have dark patch on the wing which can provide shade for the body and a few use the obelisk posture to avoid overheating this behaviour involves doing a handstand perching with the body raised and the abdomen pointing towards the sun thus minimising the amount of solar radiation received on a hot day dragonfly sometimes adjust their body temperature by skimming over a water surface and briefly touching it often three time in quick succession this may also help to avoid desiccation feeding adult dragonfly hunt on the wing using their exceptionally acute eyesight and strong agile flight they are almost exclusively carnivorous eating a wide variety of insect ranging from small midge and mosquito to butterfly moth damselfly and smaller dragonfly a large prey item is subdued by being bitten on the head and is carried by the leg to a perch here the wing are discarded and the prey usually ingested head first a dragonfly may consume a much a a fifth of it body weight in prey per day dragonfly are also some of the insect world most efficient hunter catching up to of the prey they pursuethe larva are voracious predator eating most living thing that are smaller than they are their staple diet is mostly bloodworm and other insect larva but they also feed on tadpole and small fish a few specie especially those that live in temporary water are likely to leave the water to feed nymph of cordulegaster bidentata sometimes hunt small arthropod on the ground at night while some specie in the anax genus have even been observed leaping out of the water to attack and kill tree frog predator and parasite although dragonfly are swift and agile flier some predator are fast enough to catch them these include falcon such a the american kestrel the merlin and the hobby nighthawk swift flycatcher and swallow also take some adult some specie of wasp too prey on dragonfly using them to provision their nest laying an egg on each captured insect in the water various specie of duck and heron eat dragonfly larva and they are also preyed on by newt frog fish and water spider amur falcon which migrate over the indian ocean at a period that coincides with the migration of the globe skimmer dragonfly pantala flavescens may actually be feeding on them while on the wingdragonflies are affected by three major group of parasite water mite gregarine protozoa and trematode flatworm fluke water mite hydracarina can kill smaller dragonfly larva and may also be seen on adult gregarine infect the gut and may cause blockage and secondary infection trematode are parasite of vertebrate such a frog with complex life cycle often involving a period a a stage called a cercaria in a secondary host a snail dragonfly nymph may swallow cercaria or these may tunnel through a nymph body wall they then enter the gut and form a cyst or metacercaria which remains in the nymph for the whole of it development if the nymph is eaten by a frog the amphibian becomes infected by the adult or fluke stage of the trematode dragonfly and human conservation most odonatologists live in temperate area and the dragonfly of north america and europe have been the subject of much research however the majority of specie live in tropical area and have been little studied with the destruction of rainforest habitat many of these specie are in danger of becoming extinct before they have even been named the greatest cause of decline is forest clearance with the consequent drying up of stream and pool which become clogged with silt the damming of river for hydroelectric scheme and the drainage of land ha reduced suitable habitat a ha pollution and the introduction of alien speciesin the international union for conservation of nature set up a status survey and conservation action plan for dragonfly this proposes the establishment of protected area around the world and the management of these area to provide suitable habitat for dragonfly outside these area encouragement should be given to modify forestry agricultural and industrial practice to enhance conservation at the same time more research into dragonfly need to be done consideration should be given to pollution control and the public should be educated about the importance of biodiversityhabitat degradation ha reduced dragonfly population across the world for example in japan over of japan wetland were lost in the century so it dragonfly now depend largely on rice field pond and creek dragonfly feed on pest insect in rice acting a a natural pest control dragonfly are steadily declining in africa and represent a conservation prioritythe dragonfly long lifespan and low population density make it vulnerable to disturbance such a from collision with vehicle on road built near wetland specie that fly low and slow may be most at riskdragonflies are attracted to shiny surface that produce polarization which they can mistake for water and they have been known to aggregate close to polished gravestone solar panel automobile and other such structure on which they attempt to lay egg these can have a local impact on dragonfly population method of reducing the attractiveness of structure such a solar panel are under experimentation in culture a faience dragonfly amulet wa found by flinders petrie at lahun from the late middle kingdom of ancient egyptfor some native american tribe dragonfly represent swiftness and activity for the navajo they symbolize pure water they are a common motif in zuni pottery stylized a a cross they appear in hopi rock art and on pueblo necklace they have been used in traditional medicine in japan and china in indonesia adult are caught on pole made sticky with birdlime then fried in oil a a delicacyimages of dragonfly are common in art nouveau especially in jewellery design they have also been used a a decorative motif on fabric and home furnishing douglas a british motorcycle manufacturer based in bristol named it innovatively designed postwar model the dragonflyamong the classical name of japan are akitsukuni Qiu Jin Guo  akitsushima Qiu Jin Dao  Li Qiu Jin Dao  akitu is an old word for dragonfly so one interpretation of akitsushima is dragonfly island this is attributed to a legend in which japan mythical founder emperor jimmu wa bitten by a mosquito which wa then eaten by a dragonflyas a seasonal symbol in japan the dragonfly is associated with autumn more generally dragonfly are symbol of courage strength and happiness and they often appear in art and literature especially haiku japanese child catch large dragonfly a a game using a hair with a small pebble tied to each end which they throw into the air the dragonfly mistake the pebble for prey get tangled in the hair and is dragged to the ground by the weightin europe dragonfly have often been seen a sinister some english vernacular name such a devil darning needle and ear cutter link them with evil or injury swedish folklore hold that the devil us dragonfly to weigh people soul the norwegian name for dragonfly is oyenstikker and in portugal they are sometimes called they are often associated with snake a in the welsh name adder servant the southern united state term snake doctor and snake feeder refer to a folk belief that dragonfly catch insect for snake or follow snake around and stitch them back together if they are injured interestingly the hungarian name for dragonfly is szitakoto the watercolourist moses harris known for his the aurelian or natural history of english insect published in the first scientific description of several odonata including the banded demoiselle calopteryx splendens he wa the first english artist to make illustration of dragonfly accurate enough to be identified to specie aeshna grandis at top left of plate illustrated though his rough drawing of a larva at lower left with the mask extended appears to be plagiarisedmore recently dragonfly watching ha become popular in america a some birdwatchers seek new group to observein heraldry like other winged insect the dragonfly is typically depicted tergiant with it back facing the viewer with it head to chief in poetry and literature lafcadio hearn wrote in his book a japanese miscellany that japanese poet had created dragonfly haiku almost a numerous a are the dragonfly themselves in the early autumn the poet matsuo basho wrote haiku such a crimson pepper pod add two pair of wing and look darting dragonfly relating the autumn season to the dragonfly hori bakusui similarly wrote dyed he is with the colour of autumnal day o red dragonfly the poet lord tennyson described a dragonfly splitting it old skin and emerging shining metallic blue like sapphire mail in his poem the two voice with the line an inner impulse rent the veil of his old husk from head to tail came out clear plate of sapphire mail the novelist h e bates described the rapid agile flight of dragonfly in his nonfiction book down the river i saw once an endless procession just over an area of of small sapphire dragonfly a continuous play of blue gauze over the snowy flower above the water it wa all confined in true dragonfly fashion to one small space it wa a continuous turning and returning an endless darting poising striking and hovering so swift that it wa often lost in sunlight in technology a dragonfly ha been genetically modified with steering neuron in it nerve cord to create a dragonfleye the neuron contain gene like those in the eye to make them sensitive to light miniature sensor a computer chip and a solar panel were fitted in a backpack over the insect thorax in front of it wing light is sent down flexible named optrodes from the backpack into the nerve cord to give steering command to the insect the result
