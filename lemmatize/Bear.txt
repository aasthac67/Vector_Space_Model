bear are carnivoran mammal of the family ursidae they are classified a caniforms or doglike carnivorans although only eight specie of bear are extant they are widespread appearing in a wide variety of habitat throughout the northern hemisphere and partially in the southern hemisphere bear are found on the continent of north america south america europe and asia common characteristic of modern bear include large body with stocky leg long snout small rounded ear shaggy hair plantigrade paw with five nonretractile claw and short tail while the polar bear is mostly carnivorous and the giant panda feed almost entirely on bamboo the remaining six specie are omnivorous with varied diet with the exception of courting individual and mother with their young bear are typically solitary animal they may be diurnal or nocturnal and have an excellent sense of smell despite their heavy build and awkward gait they are adept runner climber and swimmer bear use shelter such a cave and log a their den most specie occupy their den during the winter for a long period of hibernation up to day bear have been hunted since prehistoric time for their meat and fur they have been used for and other form of entertainment such a being made to dance with their powerful physical presence they play a prominent role in the art mythology and other cultural aspect of various human society in modern time bear have come under pressure through encroachment on their habitat and illegal trade in bear part including the asian bile bear market the iucn list six bear specie a vulnerable or endangered and even least concern specie such a the brown bear are at risk of extirpation in certain country the poaching and international trade of these most threatened population are prohibited but still ongoing etymology the english word bear come from old english bera and belongs to a family of name for the bear in germanic language such a swedish bjorn also used a a first name this form is conventionally said to be related to a word for brown so that bear would mean the brown one however ringe note that while this etymology is semantically plausible a word meaning brown of this form can not be found in he suggests instead that bear is from the word ghwer wild animal this terminology for the animal originated a a taboo avoidance term tribe replaced their original word for this euphemistic expression out of fear that speaking the animal true name might cause it to appear according to author ralph keyes this is the oldest known euphemismbear taxon name such a arctoidea and helarctos come from the ancient greek arktos arktos meaning bear a do the name arctic and antarctic via the name of the constellation ursa major the great bear prominent in the northern skybear taxon name such a ursidae and ursus come from latin the female first name ursula originally derived from a christian saint name mean little diminutive of latin ursa in switzerland the male first name ur is especially popular while the name of the canton and city of bern is derived from bar german for bear the germanic name bernard including bernhardt and similar form mean or bold bear the old english name beowulf is a kenning for bear in turn meaning a brave warrior taxonomy the family ursidae is one of nine family in the suborder caniformia or doglike carnivorans within the order carnivora bear closest living relative are the pinniped canid and musteloids modern bear comprise eight specie in three subfamily ailuropodinae monotypic with the giant panda tremarctinae monotypic with the spectacled bear and ursinae containing six specie divided into one to three genus depending on the authority nuclear chromosome analysis show that the karyotype of the six ursine bear is nearly identical with each having chromosome see ursid hybrid whereas the giant panda ha chromosome and the spectacled bear these smaller number can be explained by the fusing of some chromosome and the banding pattern on these match those of the ursine specie but differ from those of procyonid which support the inclusion of these two specie in ursidae rather than in procyonidae where they had been placed by some earlier authority evolution the earliest member of ursidae belong to the extinct subfamily amphicynodontinae including parictis late eocene to early middle miocene mya and the slightly younger allocyon early oligocene mya both from north america these animal looked very different from today bear being small and in overall appearance with diet perhaps more similar to that of a badger parictis doe not appear in eurasia and africa until the miocene it is unclear whether ursids were also present in eurasia although faunal exchange across the bering land bridge may have been possible during a major sea level low stand a early a the late eocene about mya and continuing into the early oligocene european genus morphologically very similar to allocyon and to the much younger american kolponomos about mya are known from the oligocene including amphicticeps and amphicynodon there ha been various morphological evidence linking amphicynodontines with pinniped a both group were mammal in addition to the support of the clade other morphological and some molecular evidence support bear being the closet living relative to pinniped the cephalogale is the member of the subfamily hemicyoninae which first appeared during the middle oligocene in eurasia about mya the subfamily includes the younger genus phoberocyon mya and plithocyon mya a specie gave rise to the genus ursavus during the early oligocene mya this genus proliferated into many specie in asia and is ancestral to all living bear specie of ursavus subsequently entered north america together with amphicynodon and cephalogale during the early miocene mya member of the living lineage of bear diverged from ursavus between and mya likely via the specie ursavus elmensis based on genetic and morphological data the ailuropodinae panda were the first to diverge from other living bear about mya although no fossil of this group have been found before about myathe new world bear tremarctinae differentiated from ursinae following a dispersal event into north america during the about mya they invaded south america or ma following formation of the isthmus of panama their earliest fossil representative is plionarctos in north america c ma this genus is probably the direct ancestor to the north american bear genus arctodus the south american bear arctotherium and the spectacled bear tremarctos represented by both an extinct north american specie t floridanus and the lone surviving representative of the tremarctinae the south american spectacled bear t ornatus the subfamily ursinae experienced a dramatic proliferation of taxon about mya coincident with major environmental change the first member of the genus ursus appeared around this time the sloth bear is a modern survivor of one of the earliest lineage to diverge during this radiation event mya it took on it peculiar morphology related to it diet of termite and ant no later than by the early pleistocene by mya the specie ursus minimus appears in the fossil record of europe apart from it size it wa nearly identical to today asian black bear it is likely ancestral to all bear within ursinae perhaps aside from the sloth bear two lineage evolved from u minimus the black bear including the sun bear the asian black bear and the american black bear and the brown bear which includes the polar bear modern brown bear evolved from u minimus via ursus etruscus which itself is ancestral to the extinct pleistocene cave bear specie of ursinae have migrated repeatedly into north america from eurasia a early a mya during the early pliocene the polar bear is the most recently evolved specie and descended from a population of brown bear that became isolated in northern latitude by glaciation year ago phylogeny the bear form a clade within the carnivora the cladogram is based on molecular phylogeny of six gene in flynn note that although they are called bear in some language red panda and raccoon and their close relative are not bear but rather musteloidsthere are two phylogenetic hypothesis on the relationship among extant and fossil bear specie one is all specie of bear are classified in seven subfamily a adopted here and related article amphicynodontinae hemicyoninae ursavinae agriotheriinae ailuropodinae tremarctinae and ursinae below is a cladogram of the subfamily of bear after mclellan and reiner and qiu et al the second alternative phylogenetic hypothesis wa implemented by mckenna et al is to classify all the bear specie into the superfamily ursoidea with hemicyoninae and agriotheriinae being classified in the family hemicyonidae amphicynodontinae under this classification were classified a in the superfamily phocoidea in the mckenna and bell classification both bear and pinniped in a parvorder of carnivoran mammal known a ursida along with the extinct bear dog of the family amphicyonidae below is the cladogram based on mckenna and bell classification the phylogeny of extant bear specie is shown in a cladogram based on complete mitochondrial dna sequence from yu et al the giant panda followed by the spectacled bear are clearly the oldest specie the relationship of the other specie are not very well resolved though the polar bear and the brown bear form a close grouping physical characteristic size the bear family includes the most massive extant terrestrial member of the order carnivora the polar bear is considered to be the largest extant specie with adult male weighing kilogram pound and measuring metre ft ft in in total length the smallest specie is the sun bear which range kg lb in weight and cm in in length prehistoric north and south american bear were the largest specie known to have lived the latter estimated to have weighed kg lb and stood m ft in tall body weight varies throughout the year in bear of temperate and arctic climate a they build up fat reserve in the summer and autumn and lose weight during the winter morphology bear are generally bulky and robust animal with short tail they are sexually dimorphic with regard to size with male typically being larger larger specie tend to show increased level of sexual dimorphism in comparison to smaller specie relying a they do on strength rather than speed bear have relatively short limb with thick bone to support their bulk the shoulder blade and the pelvis are correspondingly massive the limb are much straighter than those of the big cat a there is no need for them to flex in the same way due to the difference in their gait the strong forelimb are used to catch prey to excavate den to dig out burrowing animal to turn over rock and log to locate prey and to club large creature unlike most other land carnivorans bear are plantigrade they distribute their weight toward the hind foot which make them look lumbering when they walk they are capable of burst of speed but soon tire and a a result mostly rely on ambush rather than the chase bear can stand on their hind foot and sit up straight with remarkable balance their front paw are flexible enough to grasp fruit and leaf bear claw are used for digging climbing tearing and catching prey the claw on the front foot are larger than those on the back and may be a hindrance when climbing tree black bear are the most arboreal of the bear and have the shortest claw panda are unique in having a bony extension on the wrist of the front foot which act a a thumb and is used for gripping bamboo shoot a the animal feedmost mammal have agouti hair with each individual hair shaft having band of color corresponding to two different type of melanin pigment bear however have a single type of melanin and the hair have a single color throughout their length apart from the tip which is sometimes a different shade the coat consists of long guard hair which form a protective shaggy covering and short dense hair which form an insulating layer trapping air close to the skin the shaggy coat help maintain body heat during winter hibernation and is shed in the spring leaving a shorter summer coat polar bear have hollow translucent guard hair which gain heat from the sun and conduct it to the skin below they have a thick layer of blubber for extra insulation and the sol of their foot have a dense pad of fur while bear tend to be uniform in color some specie may have marking on the chest or face and the giant panda ha a bold pelagebears have small rounded ear so a to minimize heat loss but neither their hearing or sight are particularly acute unlike many other carnivorans they have color vision perhaps to help them distinguish ripe nut and fruit they are unique among carnivorans in not having whisker on the muzzle however they have an excellent sense of smell better than that of the dog or possibly any other mammal they use smell for signalling to each other either to warn off rival or detect mate and for finding food smell is the principal sense used by bear to locate most of their food and they have excellent memory which help them to relocate place where they have found food before the skull of bear are massive providing anchorage for the powerful masseter and temporal jaw muscle the canine teeth are large but mostly used for display and the molar teeth flat and crushing unlike most other member of the carnivora bear have relatively undeveloped carnassial teeth and their teeth are adapted for a diet that includes a significant amount of vegetable matter considerable variation occurs in dental formula even within a given specie this may indicate bear are still in the process of evolving from a mainly diet to a predominantly herbivorous one polar bear appear to have secondarily cheek teeth a their diet have switched back towards carnivory sloth bear lack lower central incisor and use their protusible lip for sucking up the termite on which they feed the general dental formula for living bear is the structure of the larynx of bear appears to be the most basal of the caniforms they posse air pouch connected to the pharynx which may amplify their vocalizationsbears have a fairly simple digestive system typical for carnivorans with a single stomach short undifferentiated intestine and no cecum even the herbivorous giant panda still ha the digestive system of a carnivore a well a gene it ability to digest cellulose is ascribed to the microbe in it gut bear must spend much of their time feeding in order to gain enough nutrition from foliage the panda in particular spends hour a day feeding distribution and habitat extant bear are found in sixty country primarily in the northern hemisphere and are concentrated in asia north america and europe an exception is the spectacled bear native to south america it inhabits the andean region the sun bear range extends below the equator in southeast asia the atlas bear a subspecies of the brown bear wa distributed in north africa from morocco to libya but it became extinct around the most widespread specie is the brown bear which occurs from western europe eastward through asia to the western area of north america the american black bear is restricted to north america and the polar bear is restricted to the arctic sea all the remaining specie of bear are asian they occur in a range of habitat which include tropical lowland rainforest both coniferous and broadleaf forest prairie steppe montane grassland alpine scree slope arctic tundra and in the case of the polar bear ice floe bear may dig their den in hillside or use cave hollow log and dense vegetation for shelter behavior and life history brown and american black bear are generally diurnal meaning that they are active for the most part during the day though they may forage substantially by night other specie may be nocturnal active at night though female sloth bear with cub may feed more at daytime to avoid competition from conspecific and nocturnal predator bear are overwhelmingly solitary and are considered to be the most asocial of all the carnivora the only time bear are encountered in group are mother with young or occasional seasonal bounty of rich food such a salmon run fight between male can occur and older individual may have extensive scarring which suggests that maintaining dominance can be intense with their acute sense of smell bear can locate carcass from several kilometre away they use olfaction to locate other food encounter mate avoid rival and recognize their cub feeding most bear are opportunistic omnivore and consume more plant than animal matter they eat anything from leaf root and berry to insect carrion fresh meat and fish and have digestive system and teeth adapted to such a diet at the extreme are the almost entirely herbivorous giant panda and the mostly carnivorous polar bear however all bear feed on any food source that becomes seasonally available for example asiatic black bear in taiwan consume large number of acorn when these are most common and switch to ungulate at other time of the yearwhen foraging for plant bear choose to eat them at the stage when they are at their most nutritious and digestible typically avoiding older grass sedge and leaf hence in more northern temperate area browsing and grazing is more common early in spring and later becomes more restricted knowing when plant are ripe for eating is a learned behavior berry may be foraged in bush or at the top of tree and bear try to maximize the number of berry consumed versus foliage in autumn some bear specie forage large amount of naturally fermented fruit which affect their behavior smaller bear climb tree to obtain mast edible reproductive part such a acorn such mast can be very important to the diet of these specie and mast failure may result in movement by bear looking for alternative food source brown bear with their powerful digging ability commonly eat root the panda diet is over bamboo of different specie it strong jaw are adapted for crushing the tough stem of these plant though they prefer to eat the more nutritious leaf bromeliads can make up to of the diet of the spectacled bear which also ha strong jaw to bite them open the sloth bear though not a specialized a polar bear and the panda ha lost several front teeth usually seen in bear and developed a long suctioning tongue to feed on the ant termite and other burrowing insect they favour at certain time of the year these insect can make up of their diet some specie may raid the nest of wasp and bee for the honey and immature insect in spite of stinging from the adult sun bear use their long tongue to lick up both insect and honey fish are an important source of food for some specie and brown bear in particular gather in large number at salmon run typically a bear plunge into the water and seizes a fish with it jaw or front paw the preferred part to eat are the brain and egg small burrowing mammal like rodent may be dug out and eaten the brown bear and both specie of black bear sometimes take large ungulate such a deer and bovid mostly the young and weak these animal may be taken by a short rush and ambush though hiding young may be stiffed out and pounced on the polar bear mainly prey on seal stalking them from the ice or breaking into their den they primarily eat the highly digestible blubber large mammalian prey is typically killed by a bite to the head or neck or in the case of young simply pinned down and mauled predatory behavior in bear is typically taught to the young by the motherbears are prolific scavenger and kleptoparasites stealing food cache from rodent and carcass from other predator for hibernating specie weight gain is important a it provides nourishment during winter dormancy a brown bear can eat kg lb of food and gain kg lb of fat a day prior to entering it den communication bear produce a number of vocal and sound grunting or chuffing many be made in cordial situation such a between mother and cub or courting couple while moaning huffing snorting or blowing air is made when an individual is stressed barking is produced during time of alarm excitement or to give away the animal position warning sound include and while bellow growl roar and pulsing sound are made in aggressive encounter cub may squeal bawl bleat or scream when in distress and make humming when comfortable or nursing bear sometimes communicate with visual display such a standing upright which exaggerates the individual size the chest marking of some specie may add to this intimidating display staring is an aggressive act and the facial marking of spectacled bear and giant panda may help draw attention to the eye during agonistic encounter individual may approach each other by walking with the head lowered dominance between bear is asserted by making a frontal orientation showing the canine teeth muzzle twisting and neck stretching a subordinate may respond with a lateral orientation by turning away and dropping the head and by sitting or lying downbears may mark territory by rubbing against tree and other object which may serve to spread their scent this is usually accompanied by clawing and biting the object bark may be spread around to draw attention to the marking post panda are known to mark object with urine and a waxy substance from their anal gland polar bear leave behind their scent in their track which allow individual to keep track of one another in the vast arctic wilderness reproduction and development the mating system of bear ha variously been described a a form of polygyny promiscuity and serial monogamy during the breeding season male take notice of female in their vicinity and female become more tolerant of male a male bear may visit a female continuously over a period of several day or week depending on the specie to test her reproductive state during this time period male try to prevent rival from interacting with their mate courtship may be brief although in some asian specie courting pair may engage in wrestling hugging mock fighting and vocalizing ovulation is induced by mating which can last up to minute depending on the specie gestation typically last month including delayed implantation and litter size number up to four cub giant panda may give birth to twin but they can only suckle one young and the other is left to die in northern living specie birth take place during winter dormancy cub are born blind and helpless with at most a thin layer of hair relying on their mother for warmth the milk of the female bear is rich in fat and antibody and cub may suckle for up to a year after they are born by month cub can follow their mother outside the den they usually follow her on foot but sloth bear cub may ride on their mother back male bear play no role in raising young infanticide where an adult male kill the cub of another ha been recorded in polar bear brown bear and american black bear but not in other specie male kill young to bring the female into estrus cub may flee and the mother defends them even at the cost of her lifein some specie offspring may become independent around the next spring through some may stay until the female successfully mate again bear reach sexual maturity shortly after they disperse at around year depending on the specie male alaskan brown bear and polar bear may continue to grow until they are year old lifespan may also vary between specie the brown bear can live an average of year hibernation bear of northern region including the american black bear and the grizzly bear hibernate in the winter during hibernation the bear metabolism slows down it body temperature decrease slightly and it heart rate slows from a normal value of to just beat per minute bear normally do not wake during their hibernation and can go the entire period without eating drinking urinating or defecating a fecal plug is formed in the colon and is expelled when the bear wake in the spring if they have stored enough body fat their muscle remain in good condition and their protein maintenance requirement are met from recycling waste urea female bear give birth during the hibernation period and are roused when doing so mortality bear do not have many predator the most important are human and a they started cultivating crop they increasingly came in conflict with the bear that raided them since the invention of firearm people have been able to kill bear with greater ease felid like the tiger may also prey on bear particularly cub which may also be threatened by canidsbears are parasitized by eighty specie of parasite including protozoan and worm and nematode and fluke in their heart liver lung and bloodstream externally they have tick flea and louse a study of american black bear found seventeen specie of endoparasite including the protozoan sarcocystis the parasitic worm diphyllobothrium mansonoides and the nematode dirofilaria immitis capillaria aerophila physaloptera sp strongyloides sp and others of these d mansonoides and adult c aerophila were causing pathological symptom by contrast polar bear have few parasite many parasitic specie need a secondary usually terrestrial host and the polar bear life style is such that few alternative host exist in their environment the protozoan toxoplasma gondii ha been found in polar bear and the nematode trichinella nativa can cause a serious infection and decline in older polar bear bear in north america are sometimes infected by a morbillivirus similar to the canine distemper virus they are susceptible to infectious canine hepatitis with black bear dying rapidly of encephalitis and hepatitis relationship with human conservation in modern time bear have come under pressure through encroachment on their habitat and illegal trade in bear part including the asian bile bear market though hunting is now banned largely replaced by farming the iucn list six bear specie a vulnerable even the two least concern specie the brown bear and the american black bear are at risk of extirpation in certain area in general these two specie inhabit remote area with little interaction with human and the main cause of mortality are hunting trapping and depredationlaws have been passed in many area of the world to protect bear from habitat destruction public perception of bear is often positive a people identify with bear due to their omnivorous diet their ability to stand on two leg and their symbolic importance support for bear protection is widespread at least in more affluent society the giant panda ha become a worldwide symbol of conservation the sichuan giant panda sanctuary which are home to around of the wild panda population gained a unesco world heritage site designation in where bear raid crop or attack livestock they may come into conflict with human in poorer rural region attitude may be more shaped by the danger posed by bear and the economic cost they cause to farmer and rancher attack several bear specie are dangerous to human especially in area where they have become used to people elsewhere they generally avoid human injury caused by bear are rare but are widely reported bear may attack human in response to being startled in defense of young or food or even for predatory reason entertainment hunting food and folk medicine bear in captivity have for century been used for entertainment they have been trained to dance and were kept for baiting in europe at least since the century there were five garden in southwark london at that time archaeological remains of three of these have survived across europe nomadic romani bear handler called ursari lived by busking with their bear from the century bear have been hunted for sport food and folk medicine their meat is dark and stringy like a tough cut of beef in cantonese cuisine bear paw are considered a delicacy bear meat should be cooked thoroughly a it can be infected with the parasite trichinella spiralisthe people of eastern asia use bear body part and secretion notably their gallbladder and bile a part of traditional chinese medicine more than bear are thought to be kept on farm in china vietnam and south korea for the production of bile trade in bear product is prohibited under cite but bear bile ha been detected in shampoo wine and herbal medicine sold in canada the united state and australia literature art and symbolism there is evidence of prehistoric bear worship though this is disputed by archaeologist it is possible that bear worship existed in early chinese and ainu culture the prehistoric finn siberian people and more recently korean considered the bear a the spirit of their forefather in many native american culture the bear is a symbol of rebirth because of it hibernation and the image of the mother bear wa prevalent throughout society in north america and eurasia based on the female devotion and protection of her cub japanese folklore feature the onikuma a demon bear that walk upright the ainu of northern japan a different people from the japanese saw the bear instead a sacred hirasawa byozan painted a scene in documentary style of a bear sacrifice in an ainu temple complete with offering to the dead animal spiritin korean mythology a tiger and a bear prayed to hwanung the son of the lord of heaven that they might become human upon hearing their prayer hwanung gave them clove of garlic and a bundle of mugwort ordering them to eat only this sacred food and remain out of the sunlight for day the tiger gave up after about twenty day and left the cave however the bear persevered and wa transformed into a woman the bear and the tiger are said to represent two tribe that sought the favor of the heavenly prince the ungnyeo wa grateful and made offering to hwanung however she lacked a husband and soon became sad and prayed beneath a divine birch tree korean sindansu hanja Shen Tan Shu  rr shindansu to be blessed with a child hwanung moved by her prayer took her for his wife and soon she gave birth to a son named dangun wanggeom who wa the legendary founder of gojoseon the first ever korean kingdom artio dea artio in the religion wa a celtic bear goddess evidence of her worship ha notably been found at bern itself named for the bear her name is derived from the celtic word for bear artos in ancient greece archaic cult of artemis in bear form survived into classical time at brauron where young athenian girl passed an initiation right a arktai she bear for artemis and one of her nymph a a see the myth of callisto the constellation of ursa major and ursa minor the great and little bear are named for their supposed resemblance to bear from the time of ptolemy the nearby star arcturus mean guardian of the bear a if it were watching the two constellation ursa major ha been associated with
