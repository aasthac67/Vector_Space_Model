fish are aquatic craniate animal that lack limb with digit they form a sister group to the tunicate together forming the olfactores included in this definition are the living hagfish lamprey and cartilaginous and bony fish a well a various extinct related group the earliest organism that can be classified a fish were chordate that first appeared during the cambrian period although they lacked a true spine they possessed notochord which allowed them to be more agile than their invertebrate counterpart fish would continue to evolve through the paleozoic era diversifying into a wide variety of form many fish of the paleozoic developed external armor that protected them from predator the first fish with jaw appeared in the silurian period after which many such a shark became formidable marine predator rather than just the prey of arthropod most fish are ectothermic allowing their body temperature to vary a ambient temperature change though some of the large active swimmer like white shark and tuna can hold a higher core temperaturefish can communicate in their underwater environment through the use of acoustic communication acoustic communication in fish involves the transmission of acoustic signal from one individual of a specie to another the production of sound a a mean of communication among fish is most often used in the context of feeding aggression or courtship behaviour the sound emitted by fish can vary depending on the specie and stimulus involved they can produce either stridulatory sound by moving component of the skeletal system or can produce sound by manipulating specialized organ such a the swimbladderfish are abundant in most body of water they can be found in nearly all aquatic environment from high mountain stream eg char and gudgeon to the abyssal and even hadal depth of the deepest ocean eg and snailfish although no specie ha yet been documented in the deepest of the ocean with described specie fish exhibit greater specie diversity than any other group of vertebratesfish are an important resource for human worldwide especially a food commercial and subsistence fisher hunt fish in wild fishery or farm them in pond or in cage in the ocean in aquaculture they are also caught by recreational fisher kept a pet raised by fishkeepers and exhibited in public aquarium fish have had a role in culture through the age serving a deity religious symbol and a the subject of art book and movie tetrapod emerged within fish so cladistically they are fish a well however traditionally fish are rendered paraphyletic by excluding the tetrapod ie the amphibian reptile bird and mammal which all descended from within the same ancestry because in this manner the term fish is defined negatively a a paraphyletic group it is not considered a formal taxonomic grouping in systematic biology unless it is used in the cladistic sense including tetrapod the traditional term pisces also ichthyes is considered a typological but not a phylogenetic classification etymology the word for fish in english and the other germanic language german fisch gothic fisks is inherited from and is related to the latin piscis and old irish iasc though the exact root is unknown some authority reconstruct an root attested only in italic celtic and germanic evolution fish a vertebrata developed a sister of the tunicata a the tetrapod emerged deep within the fish group a sister of the lungfish characteristic of fish are typically shared by tetrapod including having vertebra and a cranium early fish from the fossil record are represented by a group of small jawless armored fish known a ostracoderm jawless fish lineage are mostly extinct an extant clade the lamprey may approximate ancient fish the first jaw are found in placodermi fossil they lacked distinct teeth having instead the oral surface of their jaw plate modified to serve the various purpose of teeth the diversity of jawed vertebrate may indicate the evolutionary advantage of a jawed mouth it is unclear if the advantage of a hinged jaw is greater biting force improved respiration or a combination of factor fish may have evolved from a creature similar to a sea squirt whose larva resemble primitive fish in important way the first ancestor of fish may have kept the larval form into adulthood a some sea squirt do today although perhaps the reverse is the case taxonomy fish are a paraphyletic group that is any clade containing all fish also contains the tetrapod which are not fish for this reason group such a the class pisces seen in older reference work are no longer used in formal classification traditional classification divide fish into three extant class and with extinct form sometimes classified within the tree sometimes a their own class class agnatha jawless fish subclass cyclostomata hagfish and lamprey subclass ostracodermi armoured jawless fish class chondrichthyes cartilaginous fish subclass elasmobranchii shark and ray subclass holocephali chimaera and extinct relative class placodermi armoured fish class acanthodii spiny shark sometimes classified under bony fish class osteichthyes bony fish subclass actinopterygii ray finned fish subclass sarcopterygii fleshy finned fish ancestor of tetrapod the above scheme is the one most commonly encountered in and general work many of the above group are paraphyletic in that they have given rise to successive group agnathan are ancestral to chondrichthyes who again have given rise to acanthodiians the ancestor of osteichthyes with the arrival of phylogenetic nomenclature the fish ha been split up into a more detailed scheme with the following major group class myxini hagfish class pteraspidomorphi early jawless fish class thelodonti class anaspida class petromyzontida or hyperoartia petromyzontidae lamprey class conodonta conodont class cephalaspidomorphi early jawless fish unranked galeaspida unranked pituriaspida unranked osteostraci infraphylum gnathostomata jawed vertebrate class placodermi armoured fish class chondrichthyes cartilaginous fish class acanthodii spiny shark superclass osteichthyes bony fish class actinopterygii fish subclass chondrostei order acipenseriformes sturgeon and paddlefish order polypteriformes reedfishes and bichirs subclass neopterygii infraclass holostei gar and bowfin infraclass teleostei many order of common fish class sarcopterygii fish subclass actinistia coelacanth subclass dipnoi lungfish sister group to the tetrapod indicates extinct taxonsome palaeontologist contend that because conodonta are chordate they are primitive fish for a fuller treatment of this taxonomy see the vertebrate article the position of hagfish in the phylum chordata is not settled phylogenetic research in and supported the idea that the hagfish and the lamprey form a natural group the cyclostomata that is a sister group of the gnathostomatathe various fish group account for more than half of vertebrate specie there are almost known extant specie of which almost are bony fish with shark ray and chimera and about hagfish and lamprey a third of these specie fall within the nine largest family from largest to smallest these family are cyprinidae gobiidae cichlidae characidae loricariidae balitoridae serranidae labridae and scorpaenidae about family are monotypic containing only one specie the final total of extant specie may grow to exceed diversity the term fish most precisely describes any craniate ie an animal with a skull and in most case a backbone that ha gill throughout life and whose limb if any are in the shape of fin unlike grouping such a bird or mammal fish are not a single clade but a paraphyletic collection of taxon including hagfish lamprey shark and ray fish coelacanth and lungfish indeed lungfish and coelacanth are closer relative of tetrapod such a mammal bird amphibian etc than of other fish such a fish or shark so the last common ancestor of all fish is also an ancestor to tetrapod a paraphyletic group are no longer recognised in modern systematic biology the use of the term fish a a biological group must be avoided many type of aquatic animal commonly referred to a fish are not fish in the sense given above example include shellfish cuttlefish starfish crayfish and jellyfish in earlier time even biologist did not make a distinction sixteenth century natural historian classified also seal whale amphibian crocodile even hippopotamus a well a a host of aquatic invertebrate a fish however according to the definition above all mammal including cetacean like whale and dolphin are not fish in some context especially in aquaculture the true fish are referred to a finfish or fin fish to distinguish them from these other animal a typical fish is ectothermic ha a streamlined body for rapid swimming extract oxygen from water using gill or us an accessory breathing organ to breathe atmospheric oxygen ha two set of paired fin usually one or two rarely three dorsal fin an anal fin and a tail fin ha jaw ha skin that is usually covered with scale and lay egg each criterion ha exception tuna swordfish and some specie of shark show some adaptation they can heat their body significantly above ambient water temperature streamlining and swimming performance varies from fish such a tuna salmon and jack that can cover per second to specie such a eel and ray that swim no more than per second many group of freshwater fish extract oxygen from the air a well a from the water using a variety of different structure lungfish have paired lung similar to those of tetrapod gouramis have a structure called the labyrinth organ that performs a similar function while many catfish such a corydoras extract oxygen via the intestine or stomach body shape and the arrangement of the fin is highly variable covering such seemingly form a seahorse pufferfish anglerfish and gulper similarly the surface of the skin may be naked a in moray eel or covered with scale of a variety of different type usually defined a placoid typical of shark and ray cosmoid fossil lungfish and coelacanth ganoid various fossil fish but also living gar and bichirs cycloid and ctenoid these last two are found on most bony fish there are even fish that live mostly on land or lay their egg on land near water mudskipper feed and interact with one another on mudflats and go underwater to hide in their burrow a single undescribed specie of phreatobius ha been called a true land fish a this catfish strictly life among waterlogged leaf litter many specie live in underground lake underground river or aquifer and are popularly known a cavefishfish range in size from the huge ft whale shark to the tiny in stout infantfish fish specie diversity is roughly divided equally between marine oceanic and freshwater ecosystem coral reef in the constitute the center of diversity for marine fish whereas continental freshwater fish are most diverse in large river basin of tropical rainforest especially the amazon congo and mekong basin more than fish specie inhabit neotropical freshwater alone such that neotropical fish represent about of all vertebrate specie on the earth exceptionally rich site in the amazon basin such a cantao state park can contain more freshwater fish specie than occur in all of europe anatomy and physiology respiration gill most fish exchange gas using gill on either side of the pharynx gill consist of threadlike structure called filament each filament contains a capillary network that provides a large surface area for exchanging oxygen and carbon dioxide fish exchange gas by pulling water through their mouth and pumping it over their gill in some fish capillary blood flow in the opposite direction to the water causing countercurrent exchange the gill push the water out through opening in the side of the pharynx some fish like shark and lamprey posse multiple gill opening however bony fish have a single gill opening on each side this opening is hidden beneath a protective bony cover called an operculum juvenile bichirs have external gill a very primitive feature that they share with larval amphibian air breathing fish from multiple group can live out of the water for extended period amphibious fish such a the mudskipper can live and move about on land for up to several day or live in stagnant or otherwise oxygen depleted water many such fish can breathe air via a variety of mechanism the skin of anguillid eel may absorb oxygen directly the buccal cavity of the electric eel may breathe air catfish of the family loricariidae callichthyidae and scoloplacidae absorb air through their digestive tract lungfish with the exception of the australian lungfish and bichirs have paired lung similar to those of tetrapod and must surface to gulp fresh air through the mouth and pas spent air out through the gill gar and bowfin have a vascularized swim bladder that function in the same way loach trahiras and many catfish breathe by passing air through the gut mudskipper breathe by absorbing oxygen across the skin similar to frog a number of fish have evolved accessory breathing organ that extract oxygen from the air labyrinth fish such a gouramis and bettas have a labyrinth organ above the gill that performs this function a few other fish have structure resembling labyrinth organ in form and function most notably snakehead pikeheads and the clariidae catfish family breathing air is primarily of use to fish that inhabit shallow seasonally variable water where the water oxygen concentration may seasonally decline fish dependent solely on dissolved oxygen such a perch and cichlid quickly suffocate while survive for much longer in some case in water that is little more than wet mud at the most extreme some fish are able to survive in damp burrow for week without water entering a state of aestivation summertime hibernation until water return air breathing fish can be divided into obligate air breather and facultative air breather obligate air breather such a the african lungfish must breathe air periodically or they suffocate facultative air breather such a the catfish hypostomus plecostomus only breathe air if they need to and will otherwise rely on their gill for oxygen most air breathing fish are facultative air breather that avoid the energetic cost of rising to the surface and the fitness cost of exposure to surface predator circulation fish have a circulatory system the heart pump the blood in a single loop throughout the body in most fish the heart consists of four part including two chamber and an entrance and exit the first part is the sinus venosus a sac that collect blood from the fish vein before allowing it to flow to the second part the atrium which is a large muscular chamber the atrium serf a a antechamber sends blood to the third part ventricle the ventricle is another muscular chamber and it pump the blood first to the fourth part bulbus arteriosus a large tube and then out of the heart the bulbus arteriosus connects to the aorta through which blood flow to the gill for oxygenation digestion jaw allow fish to eat a wide variety of food including plant and other organism fish ingest food through the mouth and break it down in the esophagus in the stomach food is further digested and in many fish processed in pouch called pyloric caecum which secrete digestive enzyme and absorb nutrient organ such a the liver and pancreas add enzyme and various chemical a the food move through the digestive tract the intestine completes the process of digestion and nutrient absorption excretion a with many aquatic animal most fish release their nitrogenous waste a ammonia some of the waste diffuse through the gill blood waste are filtered by the kidney saltwater fish tend to lose water because of osmosis their kidney return water to the body the reverse happens in freshwater fish they tend to gain water osmotically their kidney produce dilute urine for excretion some fish have specially adapted kidney that vary in function allowing them to move from freshwater to saltwater scale the scale of fish originate from the mesoderm skin they may be similar in structure to teeth sensory and nervous system central nervous system fish typically have quite small brain relative to body size compared with other vertebrate typically the brain mass of a similarly sized bird or mammal however some fish have relatively large brain most notably mormyrids and shark which have brain about a massive relative to body weight a bird and marsupialsfish brain are divided into several region at the front are the olfactory lobe a pair of structure that receive and process signal from the nostril via the two olfactory nerve the olfactory lobe are very large in fish that hunt primarily by smell such a hagfish shark and catfish behind the olfactory lobe is the telencephalon the structural equivalent to the cerebrum in higher vertebrate in fish the telencephalon is concerned mostly with olfaction together these structure form the forebrain connecting the forebrain to the midbrain is the diencephalon in the diagram this structure is below the optic lobe and consequently not visible the diencephalon performs function associated with hormone and homeostasis the pineal body lie just above the diencephalon this structure detects light maintains circadian rhythm and control color changesthe midbrain or mesencephalon contains the two optic lobe these are very large in specie that hunt by sight such a rainbow trout and cichlidsthe hindbrain or metencephalon is particularly involved in swimming and balance the cerebellum is a structure that is typically the biggest part of the brain hagfish and lamprey have relatively small cerebellae while the mormyrid cerebellum is massive and apparently involved in their electrical sensethe brain stem or myelencephalon is the brain posterior a well a controlling some muscle and body organ in bony fish at least the brain stem governs respiration and osmoregulation sense organ most fish posse highly developed sense organ nearly all daylight fish have color vision that is at least a good a a human see vision in fish many fish also have chemoreceptor that are responsible for extraordinary sens of taste and smell although they have ear many fish may not hear very well most fish have sensitive receptor that form the lateral line system which detects gentle current and vibration and sens the motion of nearby fish and prey some fish such a catfish and shark have the ampulla of lorenzini electroreceptors that detect weak electric current on the order of millivolt other fish like the south american electric fish gymnotiformes can produce weak electric current which they use in navigation and social communication fish orient themselves using landmark and may use mental map based on multiple landmark or symbol fish behavior in maze reveals that they posse spatial memory and visual discrimination vision vision is an important sensory system for most specie of fish fish eye are similar to those of terrestrial vertebrate like bird and mammal but have a more spherical lens their retina generally have both rod and cone for scotopic and photopic vision and most specie have colour vision some fish can see ultraviolet and some can see polarized light amongst jawless fish the lamprey ha eye while the hagfish ha only primitive eyespot fish vision show adaptation to their visual environment for example deep sea fish have eye suited to the dark environment hearing hearing is an important sensory system for most specie of fish fish sense sound using their lateral line and their ear cognition new research ha expanded preconception about the cognitive capacity of fish for example manta ray have exhibited behavior linked to in mirror test case placed in front of a mirror individual ray engaged in contingency testing that is repetitive behavior aiming to check whether their reflection behavior mimic their body movementwrasses have also passed the mirror test in a scientific studycases of tool use have also been noticed notably in the choerodon family in archerfish and atlantic cod capacity for pain experiment done by william tavolga provide evidence that fish have pain and fear response for instance in tavolga experiment toadfish grunted when electrically shocked and over time they came to grunt at the mere sight of an electrodein scottish scientist at the university of edinburgh and the roslin institute concluded that rainbow trout exhibit behavior often associated with pain in other animal bee venom and acetic acid injected into the lip resulted in fish rocking their body and rubbing their lip along the side and floor of their tank which the researcher concluded were attempt to relieve pain similar to what mammal would do neuron fired in a pattern resembling human neuronal patternsprofessor james d rose of the university of wyoming claimed the study wa flawed since it did not provide proof that fish posse conscious awareness particularly a kind of awareness that is meaningfully like ours rose argues that since fish brain are so different from human brain fish are probably not conscious in the manner human are so that reaction similar to human reaction to pain instead have other cause rose had published a study a year earlier arguing that fish can not feel pain because their brain lack a neocortex however animal behaviorist temple grandin argues that fish could still have consciousness without a neocortex because different specie can use different brain structure and system to handle the same function animal welfare advocate raise concern about the possible suffering of fish caused by angling some country such a germany have banned specific type of fishing and the british rspca now formally prosecutes individual who are cruel to fish emotion in scientist have shown that member of the monogamous specie amatitlania siquia exhibit pessimistic behavior when they are prevented from being with their partner muscular system most fish move by alternately contracting paired set of muscle on either side of the backbone these contraction form curve that move down the body a each curve reach the back fin backward force is applied to the water and in conjunction with the fin move the fish forward the fish fin function like an airplane flap fin also increase the tail surface area increasing speed the streamlined body of the fish decrease the amount of friction from the water since body tissue is denser than water fish must compensate for the difference or they will sink many bony fish have an internal organ called a swim bladder that adjusts their buoyancy through manipulation of gas endothermy although most fish are exclusively ectothermic there are exception the only known bony fish infraclass teleostei that exhibit endothermy are in the suborder scombroidei which includes the billfish tuna and the butterfly kingfish a basal specie of mackerel and also the opah the opah a lampriform wa demonstrated in to utilize endothermy generating heat with it swimming muscle to warm it body while countercurrent exchange a in respiration minimizes heat loss it is able to actively hunt prey such a squid and swim for long distance due to the ability to warm it entire body including it heart which is a trait typically found in only mammal and bird in the form of homeothermy in the cartilaginous fish class chondrichthyes shark of the family lamnidae porbeagle mackerel salmon and great white shark and alopiidae thresher shark exhibit endothermy the degree of endothermy varies from the billfish which warm only their eye and brain to the bluefin tuna and the porbeagle shark which maintain body temperature in excess of above ambient water temperaturesendothermy though metabolically costly is thought to provide advantage such a increased muscle strength higher rate of central nervous system processing and higher rate of digestion reproductive system fish reproductive organ include testicle and ovary in most specie gonad are paired organ of similar size which can be partially or totally fused there may also be a range of secondary organ that increase reproductive fitness in term of spermatogonia distribution the structure of teleost testis ha two type in the most common spermatogonia occur all along the seminiferous tubule while in atherinomorph fish they are confined to the distal portion of these structure fish can present cystic or spermatogenesis in relation to the release phase of germ cell in cyst to the seminiferous tubule lumenfish ovary may be of three type gymnovarian secondary gymnovarian or cystovarian in the first type the oocyte are released directly into the coelomic cavity and then enter the ostium then through the oviduct and are eliminated secondary gymnovarian ovary shed ovum into the coelom from which they go directly into the oviduct in the third type the oocyte are conveyed to the exterior through the oviduct gymnovaries are the primitive condition found in lungfish sturgeon and bowfin cystovaries characterize most teleost where the ovary lumen ha continuity with the oviduct secondary gymnovaries are found in salmonid and a few other teleost oogonia development in teleost fish varies according to the group and the determination of oogenesis dynamic allows the understanding of maturation and fertilization process change in the nucleus ooplasm and the surrounding layer characterize the oocyte maturation processpostovulatory follicle are structure formed after oocyte release they do not have endocrine function present a wide irregular lumen and are rapidly reabsorbed in a process involving the apoptosis of follicular cell a degenerative process called follicular atresia reabsorbs vitellogenic oocyte not spawned this process can also occur but le frequently in oocyte in other development stagessome fish like the california sheephead are hermaphrodite having both testis and ovary either at different phase in their life cycle or a in hamlet have them simultaneously over of all known fish are oviparous that is the egg develop outside the mother body example of oviparous fish include salmon goldfish cichlid tuna and eel in the majority of these specie fertilisation take place outside the mother body with the male and female fish shedding their gamete into the surrounding water however a few oviparous fish practice internal fertilization with the male using some sort of intromittent organ to deliver sperm into the genital opening of the female most notably the oviparous shark such a the horn shark and oviparous ray such a skate in these case the male is equipped with a pair of modified pelvic fin known a claspers marine fish can produce high number of egg which are often released into the open water column the egg have an average diameter of millimetre in the newly hatched young of oviparous fish are called larva they are usually poorly formed carry a large yolk sac for nourishment and are very different in appearance from juvenile and adult specimen the larval period in oviparous fish is relatively short usually only several week and larva rapidly grow and change appearance and structure a process termed metamorphosis to become juvenile during this transition larva must switch from their yolk sac to feeding on zooplankton prey a process which depends on typically inadequate zooplankton density starving many larva in ovoviviparous fish the egg develop inside the mother body after internal fertilization but receive little or no nourishment directly from the mother depending instead on the yolk each embryo develops in it own egg familiar example of ovoviviparous fish include guppy angel shark and coelacanth some specie of fish are viviparous in such specie the mother retains the egg and nourishes the embryo typically viviparous fish have a structure analogous to the placenta seen in mammal connecting the mother blood supply with that of the embryo example of viviparous fish include the splitfins and lemon shark some viviparous fish exhibit oophagy in which the developing embryo eat other egg produced by the mother this ha been observed primarily among shark such a the shortfin mako and porbeagle but is known for a few bony fish a well such a the halfbeak nomorhamphus ebrardtii intrauterine cannibalism is an even more unusual mode of vivipary in which the largest embryo eat weaker and smaller sibling this behavior is also most commonly found among shark such a the grey nurse shark but ha also been reported for nomorhamphus ebrardtiiaquarists commonly refer to ovoviviparous and viviparous fish a livebearers acoustic communication in fish acoustic communication in fish involves the transmission of acoustic signal from one individual of a specie to another the production of sound a a mean of communication among fish is most often used in the context of feeding aggression or courtship behaviour the sound emitted can vary depending on the specie and stimulus involved fish can produce either stridulatory sound by moving component of the skeletal system or can produce sound by manipulating specialized organ such a the swimbladder stridulatory sound producing mechanism there are some specie of fish that can produce sound by rubbing or grinding their bone together these noise produced by interaction are known a example of this is seen in haemulon flavolineatum a specie commonly referred to a the grunt fish a it produce a grunting noise by grinding it teeth together this behaviour is most pronounced when the h flavolineatum is in distress situation the grunt produced by this specie of fish generate a frequency of approximately hz and last approximately millisecond the h flavolineatum doe not emit sound with frequency greater than hz and doe not detect sound that have frequency greater than hzin a study conducted by oliveira et al the longsnout seahorse hippocampus reidi wa recorded producing two different category of sound click and growl the sound emitted by the h reidi are accomplished by rubbing their coronet bone across the grooved section of their neurocranium clicking sound were found to be primarily produced during courtship and feeding and the frequency of click were within the range of hz the frequency were noted to be on the higher end of the range during spawning period when the female and male fish were le than fifteen centimeter apart growl sound were produced when the h reidi encountered stressful situation such a handling by researcher the growl sound consist of a series of sound pulse and are emitted simultaneously with body vibration sound producing mechanism some fish specie create noise by engaging specialized muscle that contract and cause swimbladder vibration oyster toadfish produce loud grunting sound by contracting muscle located along the side of their swim bladder known a sonic muscle female and male toadfish emit grunt often a a fright response in addition to grunt male toadfish produce boat whistle call these call are longer in duration lower in frequency and are primarily used to attract mate the sound emitted by the o tao have frequency range of hz to hz the frequency of the call depend on the rate at which the sonic muscle contractthe red drum sciaenops ocellatus produce drumming sound by vibrating it swimbladder vibration are caused by the rapid contraction of sonic muscle that surround the dorsal aspect of the swimbladder these vibration result in repeated sound with frequency that range from to hz the s ocellatus can produce different call depending on the stimulus involved the sound created in courtship situation are different from those made during distressing event such a predatorial attack unlike the male of the s ocellatus specie the female of this specie do produce sound and lack sonic muscle disease like other animal fish suffer from disease and parasite to prevent disease they have a variety of defense defense include the skin and scale a well a the mucus layer secreted by the epidermis that trap and inhibits the growth of microorganism if pathogen breach these defense fish can develop an inflammatory response that increase blood flow to the infected region and delivers white blood cell that attempt to destroy pathogen specific defense respond to particular pathogen recognised by the fish body ie an immune response in recent year vaccine have become widely used in aquaculture and also with ornamental fish for example furunculosis vaccine in farmed salmon and koi herpes virus in koisome specie use cleaner fish to remove external parasite the best known of these are the bluestreak cleaner wrasse of the genus labroides found on coral reef in the indian and pacific ocean these small fish maintain cleaning station where other fish congregate and perform specific movement to attract the attention of the cleaner cleaning behavior have been observed in a number of fish group including an interesting case between two cichlid of the same genus etroplus maculatus the cleaner and the much larger etroplus suratensis immune system immune organ vary by type of fish in the jawless fish lamprey and hagfish true lymphoid organ are absent these fish rely on region of lymphoid tissue within other organ to produce immune cell for example erythrocyte macrophage and plasma cell are produced in the anterior kidney or pronephros and some area of the gut where granulocyte mature they resemble primitive bone marrow in hagfish cartilaginous fish shark and ray have a more advanced immune system they have three specialized organ that are unique to chondrichthyes the epigonal organ lymphoid tissue similar to mammalian bone that surround the gonad the leydig organ within the wall of their esophagus and a spiral valve in their intestine these organ house typical immune cell granulocyte lymphocyte and plasma cell they also posse an identifiable thymus and a spleen their most important immune organ where various lymphocyte plasma cell and macrophage develop and are stored chondrostean fish sturgeon paddlefish and bichirs posse a major site for the production of granulocyte within a mass that is associated with the meninges membrane surrounding the central nervous system their heart is frequently covered with tissue that contains lymphocyte reticular cell and a small number of macrophage the chondrostean kidney is an important hemopoietic organ where erythrocyte granulocyte lymphocyte and macrophage develop like chondrostean fish the major immune tissue of bony fish or teleostei include the kidney especially the anterior kidney which house many different immune cell in addition teleost fish posse a thymus spleen and scattered immune area within mucosal tissue eg in the skin gill gut and gonad much like the mammalian immune system teleost erythrocyte neutrophil and granulocyte are believed to reside in the spleen whereas lymphocyte are the major cell type found in the thymus in a lymphatic system similar to that in mammal wa described in one specie of teleost fish the zebrafish although not confirmed a yet this system presumably will be where naive unstimulated t cell accumulate while waiting to encounter an antigenb and t lymphocyte bearing immunoglobulin and t cell receptor respectively are found in all jawed fish indeed the adaptive immune system a a whole evolved in an ancestor of all jawed vertebrate conservation the iucn red list name fish specie that are threatened with extinction included are specie such a atlantic cod devil hole pupfish coelacanth and great white shark because fish live underwater they are more difficult to study than terrestrial animal and plant and information about fish population is often lacking however freshwater fish seem particularly threatened because they often live in relatively small water body for example the devil hole pupfish occupies only a single by metre by ft pool overfishing overfishing is a major threat to edible fish such a cod and tuna overfishing eventually cause population known a stock collapse because the survivor can not produce enough young to replace those removed such commercial extinction doe not mean that the specie is extinct merely that it can no longer sustain a fishery one example of fishery collapse is the pacific sardine sadinops sagax caerulues fishery off the california coast from a peak of long ton t the catch steadily declined to only long ton t in after which the fishery wa no longer economically viablethe main tension between fishery science and the fishing industry is that the two group have different view on the resiliency of fishery to intensive fishing in place such a scotland newfoundland and alaska the fishing industry is a major employer so government are predisposed to support it on the other hand scientist and conservationist push for stringent protection warning that many stock could be wiped out within fifty year habitat destruction a key stress on both freshwater and marine ecosystem is habitat degradation including water pollution the building of dam removal of water for use by human and the introduction of exotic specie an example of a fish that ha become endangered because of habitat change is the pallid sturgeon a north american freshwater fish that life in river damaged by human activity exotic specie introduction of specie ha occurred in many habitat one of the best studied example is the introduction of nile perch into lake victoria in the nile perch gradually exterminated the lake endemic cichlid specie some of them survive now in captive breeding programme but others are probably extinct carp snakehead tilapia european perch brown trout rainbow trout and sea lamprey are other example of fish that have caused problem by being introduced into alien environment importance to human economic importance throughout history human have utilized fish a a food source historically and today most fish protein ha come by mean of catching wild fish however aquaculture or fish farming which ha been practiced since about bce in china is becoming increasingly important in many nation overall about of the world protein is estimated to be provided by fish that proportion is considerably elevated in some developing nation and region heavily dependent on the sea in a similar manner fish have been tied to trade catching fish for the purpose of food or sport is known a fishing while the organized effort by human to catch fish is called a fishery fishery are a huge global business and provide income for million of people the annual yield from all fishery worldwide is about million ton with popular specie including herring cod anchovy tuna flounder and salmon however the term fishery is broadly applied and includes more organism than just fish such a mollusk and crustacean which are often called fish when used a food recreation fishkeeping fish have been recognized a a source of beauty for almost a long a used for food appearing in cave art being raised a ornamental fish in pond and displayed in aquarium in home office or public setting recreational fishing recreational fishing is fishing primarily for pleasure or competition it can be contrasted with commercial fishing which is fishing for profit or subsistence fishing which is fishing primarily for food the most common form of recreational fishing is done with a rod reel line hook and any one of a wide range of bait recreational fishing is particularly popular in north america and europe and state provincial and federal government agency actively management target fish specie angling is a method of fishing specifically the practice of catching fish by mean of an angle hook angler must select the right hook cast accurately and retrieve at the right speed while considering water and weather condition specie fish response time of the day and other factor culture fish theme have symbolic significance in many religion in ancient mesopotamia fish offering were made to the god from the very earliest time fish were also a major symbol of enki the god of water fish frequently appear a filling motif in cylinder seal from the old babylonian c bc c bc and bc period starting during the kassite period c bc c bc and lasting until the early persian period bc healer and exorcist dressed in ritual garb resembling the body of fish during the seleucid period bc the legendary babylonian culture hero oannes described by berossus wa said to have dressed in the skin of a fish fish were sacred to the syrian goddess atargatis and during her festival only her priest were permitted to eat them in the book of jonah a work of jewish literature probably written in the fourth century bc the central figure a prophet named jonah is swallowed by a giant fish after being thrown overboard by the crew of the ship he is travelling on the fish later vomit jonah out on shore after three day this book wa later included a part of the hebrew bible or christian old testament and a version of the story it contains is summarized in surah of the quran early christian used the ichthys a symbol of a fish to represent jesus because the greek word for fish ikhthus ichthys could be used a an acronym for iesous khristos theou uios soter iesous christos theou huios soter meaning jesus christ son of god saviour the gospel also refer to fisher of men and feeding the multitude in the dhamma of buddhism the fish symbolize happiness a they have complete freedom of movement in the water often drawn in the form of carp which are regarded in the orient a sacred on account of their elegant beauty size and among the deity said to take the form of a fish are of the polynesian dagon of various ancient semitic people the of hawai`i and
