the aardvark orycteropus afer is a burrowing nocturnal mammal native to africa it is the only living specie of the order tubulidentata although other prehistoric specie and genus of tubulidentata are known unlike other insectivore it ha a long snout which is used to sniff out food it roams over most of the southern of the african continent avoiding area that are mainly rocky a nocturnal feeder it subsists on ant and termite which it will dig out of their hill using it sharp claw and powerful leg it also dig to create burrow in which to live and rear it young it receives a least concern rating from the iucn although it number seem to be decreasing aardvark are afrotheres a clade which also includes elephant manatee and hyrax name and taxonomy name the aardvark is sometimes colloquially called african ant bear anteater not to be confused with the south american anteater or the cape anteater after the cape of good hope the name aardvark is afrikaans afrikaans pronunciation 'a:rtfark come from earlier afrikaans erdvark and mean earth pig or ground pig aarde vark pig because of it burrowing habit the name orycteropus mean burrowing foot and the name afer refers to africa the name of the aardvark order tubulidentata come from the teeth taxonomy the aardvark is not closely related to the pig rather it is the sole extant representative of the obscure mammalian order tubulidentata in which it is usually considered to form one variable specie of the genus orycteropus the sole surviving genus in the family orycteropodidae the aardvark is not closely related to the south american anteater despite sharing some characteristic and a superficial resemblance the similarity are based on convergent evolution the closest living relative of the aardvark are the elephant shrew tenrec and golden mole along with the sirenian hyrax elephant and their extinct relative these animal form the superorder afrotheria study of the brain have shown the similarity with condylarthra and given the clade status a a wastebasket taxon it may mean some specie traditionally classified a condylarths are actually evolutionary history based on fossil bryan patterson ha concluded that early relative of the aardvark appeared in africa around the end of the paleocene the ptolemaiidans a mysterious clade of mammal with uncertain affinity may actually be either a a sister clade to tubulidentata or a a grade leading to true tubulidentatesthe first unambiguous tubulidentate wa probably myorycteropus africanus from kenyan miocene deposit the earliest example from the genus orycteropus wa orycteropus mauritanicus found in algeria in deposit from the middle miocene with an equally old version found in kenya fossil from the aardvark have been dated to million year and have been located throughout europe and the near eastthe mysterious pleistocene plesiorycteropus from madagascar wa originally thought to be a tubulidentate that wa descended from ancestor that entered the island during the eocene however a number of subtle anatomical difference coupled with recent molecular evidence now lead researcher to believe that plesiorycteropus is a relative of golden mole and tenrec that achieved an appearance and ecological niche through convergent evolution subspecies the aardvark ha seventeen poorly defined subspecies listed orycteropus afer afer o a adametzi grote o a aethiopicus sundevall o a angolensis zukowsky haltenorth o a erikssoni lonnberg o a faradjius hatt o a haussanus matschie o a kordofanicus rothschild o a lademanni grote o a leptodon hirst o a matschiei grote o a observandus grote o a ruvanensis grote o a senegalensis lesson o a somalicus lydekker o a wardi lydekker o a wertheri matschie encyclopaedia britannica also mention o a capensis or cape from south africa description the aardvark is vaguely in appearance it body is stout with a prominently arched back and is sparsely covered with coarse hair the limb are of moderate length with the rear leg being longer than the foreleg the front foot have lost the pollex or resulting in four toe while the rear foot have all five toe each toe bear a large robust nail which is somewhat flattened and and appears to be intermediate between a claw and a hoof whereas the aardvark is considered digitigrade it appears at time to be plantigrade this confusion happens because when it squat it stand on it sol a contributing characteristic to the burrow digging capability of aardvark is an endosteal tissue called compacted coarse cancellous bone cccb the stress and strain resistance provided by cccb allows aardvark to create their burrow ultimately leading to a favorable environment for plant and a variety of animalsan aardvark weight is typically between and kilogram lb an aardvark length is usually between and centimetre ft and can reach length of metre ft in when it tail which can be up to centimetre in is taken into account it is centimetre in tall at the shoulder and ha a girth of about centimetre ft it is the largest member of the proposed clade afroinsectiphilia the aardvark is pale in color and often stained by soil the aardvark coat is thin and the animal primary protection is it tough skin it hair is short on it head and tail however it leg tend to have longer hair the hair on the majority of it body is grouped in cluster of hair the hair surrounding it nostril is dense to help filter particulate matter out a it dig it tail is very thick at the base and gradually taper head the greatly elongated head is set on a short thick neck and the end of the snout bear a disc which house the nostril it contains a thin but complete zygomatic arch the head of the aardvark contains many unique and different feature one of the most distinctive characteristic of the tubulidentata is their teeth instead of having a pulp cavity each tooth ha a cluster of thin hexagonal upright parallel tube of vasodentin a modified form of dentine with individual pulp canal held together by cementum the number of column is dependent on the size of the tooth with the largest having about the teeth have no enamel coating and are worn away and regrow continuously the aardvark is born with conventional incisor and canine at the front of the jaw which fall out and are not replaced adult aardvark have only cheek teeth at the back of the jaw and have a dental formula of these remaining teeth are and rootless and are of unique composition the teeth consist of upper and lower jaw molar the nasal area of the aardvark is another unique area a it contains ten nasal concha more than any other placental mammalthe side of the nostril are thick with hair the tip of the snout is highly mobile and is moved by modified mimetic muscle the fleshy dividing tissue between it nostril probably ha sensory function but it is uncertain whether they are olfactory or vibratory in nature it nose is made up of more turbinate bone than any other mammal with between and compared to dog with to with a large quantity of turbinate bone the aardvark ha more space for the moist epithelium which is the location of the olfactory bulb the nose contains nine olfactory bulb more than any other mammal it keen sense of smell is not just from the quantity of bulb in the nose but also in the development of the brain a it olfactory lobe is very developed the snout resembles an elongated pig snout the mouth is small and tubular typical of specie that feed on ant and termite the aardvark ha a long thin snakelike protruding tongue a much a centimetre in long and elaborate structure supporting a keen sense of smell the ear which are very effective are disproportionately long about centimetre in long the eye are small for it head and consist only of rod digestive system the aardvark stomach ha a muscular pyloric area that act a a gizzard to grind swallowed food up thereby rendering chewing unnecessary it cecum is large both sex emit a strong smelling secretion from an anal gland it salivary gland are highly developed and almost completely ring the neck their output is what cause the tongue to maintain it tackiness the female ha two pair of teat in the inguinal regiongenetically speaking the aardvark is a living fossil a it chromosome are highly conserved reflecting much of the early eutherian arrangement before the divergence of the major modern taxon habitat and range aardvark are found in africa where suitable habitat savanna grassland woodland and bushland and food ie ant and termite is available they spend the daylight hour in dark burrow to avoid the heat of the day the only major habitat that they are not present in is swamp forest a the high water table precludes digging to a sufficient depth they also avoid terrain rocky enough to cause problem with digging they have been documented a high a metre ft in ethiopia they are present throughout africa all the way to south africa with few exception these exception include the coastal area of namibia ivory coast and ghana they are not found in madagascar ecology and behaviour aardvark live for up to year in captivity it keen hearing warns it of predator lion leopard cheetah african wild dog hyena and python some human also hunt aardvark for meat aardvark can dig fast or run in zigzag fashion to elude enemy but if all else fails they will strike with their claw tail and shoulder sometimes flipping onto their back lying motionless except to lash out with all four foot they are capable of causing substantial damage to unprotected area of an attacker they will also dig to escape a they can when pressed dig extremely quickly feeding the aardvark is nocturnal and is a solitary creature that feed almost exclusively on ant and termite myrmecophagy the only fruit eaten by aardvark is the aardvark cucumber in fact the cucumber and the aardvark have a symbiotic relationship a they eat the subterranean fruit then defecate the seed near their burrow which then grow rapidly due to the loose soil and fertile nature of the area the time spent in the intestine of the aardvark help the fertility of the seed and the fruit provides needed moisture for the aardvark they avoid eating the african driver ant and red ant due to their stringent diet requirement they require a large range to survive an aardvark emerges from it burrow in the late afternoon or shortly after sunset and forage over a considerable home range encompassing to kilometre to mi while foraging for food the aardvark will keep it nose to the ground and it ear pointed forward which indicates that both smell and hearing are involved in the search for food they a they forage and will usually not repeat a route for day a they appear to allow time for the termite nest to recover before feeding on it againduring a foraging period they will stop and dig a v shaped trench with their forefoot and then sniff it profusely a a mean to explore their location when a concentration of ant or termite is detected the aardvark dig into it with it powerful front leg keeping it long ear upright to listen for predator and take up an astonishing number of insect with it long sticky many a in one night have been recorded it claw enable it to dig through the extremely hard crust of a termite or ant mound quickly it avoids inhaling the dust by sealing the nostril when successful the aardvark long up to centimetre in tongue lick up the insect the termite biting or the ant stinging attack are rendered futile by the tough skin after an aardvark visit at a termite mound other animal will visit to pick up all the leftover termite mound alone do provide enough food for the aardvark so they look for termite that are on the move when these insect move they can form column metre ft long and these tend to provide easy picking with little effort exerted by the aardvark these column are more common in area of livestock or other hoofed animal the trampled grass and dung attract termite from the odontotermes microtermes and pseudacanthotermes generaon a nightly basis they tend to be more active during the first portion of night roughly the four hour between pm and am however they do seem to prefer bright or dark night over the other during adverse weather or if disturbed they will retreat to their burrow system they cover between and kilometre and mi per night however some study have shown that they may traverse a far a kilometre mi in a night vocalization the aardvark is a rather quiet animal however it doe make soft grunting sound a it forage and loud grunt a it make for it tunnel entrance it make a bleating sound if frightened when it is threatened it will make for one of it burrow if one is not close it will dig a new one rapidly this new one will be short and require the aardvark to back out when the coast is clear movement the aardvark is known to be a good swimmer and ha been witnessed successfully swimming in strong current it can dig a yard of tunnel in about five minute but otherwise move fairly slowly when leaving the burrow at night they pause at the entrance for about ten minute sniffing and listening after this period of watchfulness it will bound out and within second it will be metre ft away it will then pause prick it ear twisting it head to listen then jump and move off to start foragingaside from digging out ant and termite the aardvark also excavates burrow in which to live which generally fall into one of three category burrow made while foraging refuge and resting location and permanent home temporary site are scattered around the home range and are used a refuge while the main burrow is also used for breeding main burrow can be deep and extensive have several entrance and can be a long a metre ft these burrow can be large enough for a man to enter the aardvark change the layout of it home burrow regularly and periodically move on and make a new one the old burrow are an important part of the african wildlife scene a they are vacated then they are inhabited by smaller animal like the african wild dog chat nycteris thebaica and warthog other animal that use them are hare mongoose hyena owl python and lizard without these refuge many animal would die during wildfire season only mother and young share burrow however the aardvark is known to live in small family group or a a solitary creature if attacked in the tunnel it will escape by digging out of the tunnel thereby placing the fresh fill between it and it predator or if it decides to fight it will roll onto it back and attack with it claw the aardvark ha been known to sleep in a recently excavated ant nest which also serf a protection from it predator reproduction aardvark pair only during the breeding season after a gestation period of seven month one cub weighing around kilogram lb is born during when born the young ha flaccid ear and many wrinkle when nursing it will nurse off each teat in succession after two week the fold of skin disappear and after three the ear can be held upright after week body hair start growing it is able to leave the burrow to accompany it mother after only two week and eats termite at week and is weaned between three month and week at six month of age it is able to dig it own burrow but it will often remain with the mother until the next mating season and is sexually mature from approximately two year of age conservation aardvark were thought to have declining number however this is possibly because they are not readily seen there are no definitive count because of their nocturnal and secretive habit however their number seem to be stable overall they are not considered common anywhere in africa but due to their large range they maintain sufficient number there may be a slight decrease in number in eastern northern and western africa southern african number are not decreasing it receives an official designation from the iucn a least concern however they are a specie in a precarious situation a they are so dependent on such specific food therefore if a problem arises with the abundance of termite the specie a a whole would be affected drasticallyaardvarks handle captivity well the first zoo to have one wa london zoo in which had an animal from south africa mythology and popular culture in african folklore the aardvark is much admired because of it diligent quest for food and it
