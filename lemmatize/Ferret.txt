white or mixed they have an average length of cm in including a cm in tail weigh about between and kg and lb and have a natural lifespan of to year ferret are sexually dimorphic predator with male being substantially larger than female the history of the ferret domestication is uncertain like that of most other domestic animal but it is likely that they have been domesticated for at least year they are still used for hunting rabbit in some part of the world but increasingly they are kept only a pet being so closely related to polecat ferret easily hybridize with them and this ha occasionally resulted in feral colony of hybrid that have caused damage to native fauna especially in new zealand a a result new zealand and some other part of the world have imposed restriction on the keeping of ferret several other mustelid also have the word ferret in their common name including the ferret an endangered specie etymology the name ferret is derived from the latin furittus meaning little thief a likely reference to the common ferret penchant for secreting away small itemsthe greek word iktis iktis latinized a ictis occurs in a play written by aristophanes the acharnians

substantially larger than female the average gestation period is day and female may have two or three litter each year the litter size is usually between three and seven kit which are weaned after three to six week and become independent at three month they become sexually mature at approximately six month and the average life span is seven to year ferret are induced ovulators behavior ferret spend hour a day asleep and are most active around the hour of dawn and dusk meaning they are crepuscular if they are caged they should be taken out daily to exercise and satisfy their curiosity they need at least an hour and a place to play unlike their polecat ancestor which are solitary animal most ferret will live happily in social group they are territorial like to burrow and prefer to sleep in an enclosed arealike many other mustelid ferret have scent gland near their anus the secretion from which are used in scent marking ferret can recognize individual from these anal gland secretion a well a the sex of unfamiliar individual ferret may also use urine marking for sex and individual recognitionas with skunk ferret can release their anal gland secretion when startled or scared but the smell is much le potent and dissipates rapidly most pet ferret in the u are sold descented anal gland removed in many other part of the world including the uk and other european country is considered an unnecessary mutilation if excited they may perform a behavior called the weasel war dance characterized by frenzied sideways hop leap and bumping into nearby object despite it common name it is not aggressive but is a joyful invitation to play it is often accompanied by a unique soft clucking noise commonly referred to a dooking when scared ferret will hiss when upset they squeak softly diet ferret are obligate carnivore the natural diet of their wild ancestor consisted of whole small prey including meat organ bone skin feather and fur ferret have short digestive system and quick metabolism so they need to eat frequently prepared dry food consisting almost entirely of meat including cat food although specialized ferret food is increasingly available and preferable provide the most nutritional value and are the most convenient though some ferret owner feed or live prey such a mouse and rabbit to their ferret to more closely mimic their natural diet ferret digestive tract lack a cecum and the animal is largely unable to digest plant matter before much wa known about ferret physiology many breeder and pet store recommended food like fruit in the ferret diet but it is now known that such food are inappropriate and may in fact have negative ramification on ferret health ferret imprint on their food at around six month old this can make introducing new food to an older ferret a challenge and even simply changing brand of kibble may meet with resistance from a ferret that ha never eaten the food a a kit it is therefore advisable to expose young ferret to a many different type and flavor of appropriate food a possible dentition ferret have four type of teeth the number includes maxillary upper and mandibular lower teeth with a dental formula of twelve small incisor teeth only mm in long located between the canine in the front of the mouth these are used for grooming four canine used for killing prey twelve premolar teeth that the ferret us to chew at the side of the mouth directly behind the canine the ferret us these teeth to cut through flesh using them in a scissors action to cut the meat into digestible chunk six molar two on top and four on the bottom at the far back of the mouth are used to crush food health ferret are known to suffer from several distinct health problem among the most common are cancer affecting the adrenal gland pancreas and lymphatic system viral disease include canine distemper and influenza health problem can occur in unspayed female when not being used for breeding certain health problem have also been linked to ferret being neutered before reaching sexual maturity certain color of ferret may also carry a genetic defect known a waardenburg syndrome similar to domestic cat ferret can also suffer from hairball and dental problem ferret will also often chew on and swallow foreign object which can lead to bowel obstruction history of domestication in common with most domestic animal the original reason for ferret being domesticated by human being is uncertain but it may have involved hunting according to phylogenetic study the ferret wa domesticated from the european polecat mustela putorius and likely descends from a north african lineage of the specie analysis of mitochondrial dna suggests that ferret were domesticated around year ago it ha been claimed that the ancient egyptian were the first to domesticate ferret but a no mummified remains of a ferret have yet been found nor any hieroglyph of a ferret and no polecat now occurs wild in the area that idea seems unlikelyferrets were probably used by the roman for huntingcolonies of feral ferret have established themselves in area where there is no competition from similarly sized predator such a in the shetland island and in remote region in new zealand where ferret coexist with polecat hybridization is common it ha been claimed that new zealand ha the world largest feral population of hybrid in farmer in new zealand demanded that ferret be introduced into the country to control the rabbit population which wa also introduced by human five ferret were imported in and in shipment of ferret were made from london totaling animal only landed and were sent from melbourne australia on the voyage the ferret were mated with the european polecat creating a number of hybrid that were capable of surviving in the wild in and close to ferret and ferret hybrid weasel and stoat were turned loose concern wa raised that these animal would eventually prey on indigenous wildlife once rabbit population dropped and this is exactly what happened to new zealand bird specie which previously had had no mammalian predator ferreting for millennium the main use of ferret wa for hunting or ferreting with their long lean build and inquisitive nature ferret are very well equipped for getting down hole and chasing rodent rabbit and mole out of their burrow caesar augustus sent ferret or mongoose named viverrae by plinius to the balearic island to control the rabbit plague in bc in england in a law wa enacted restricting the use of ferret for hunting to the relatively wealthy it is ordained that no manner of layman which hath not land to the value of forty shilling a year shall from henceforth keep any greyhound or other dog to hunt nor shall he use ferret net heys harepipes nor cord nor other engine for to take or destroy deer hare nor cony nor other gentleman game under pain of twelve month imprisonment ferret were first introduced into the new world in the century and were used extensively from until the start of world war ii to protect grain store in the american west from rodent they are still used for hunting in some country including the united kingdom where rabbit are considered a plague specie by farmer the practice is illegal in several country where it is feared that ferret could unbalance the ecology in in finland where ferreting wa previously unknown the city of helsinki began to use ferret to restrict the city rabbit population to a manageable level ferreting wa chosen because in populated area it is considered to be safer and le ecologically damaging than shooting the rabbit a pet in the united state ferret were relatively rare pet until the a government study by the california state bird and mammal conservation program estimated that by about domestic ferret were being kept a pet in the united stateslike many household pet ferret require a cage for ferret a wire cage at least in mm long and deep and in mm wide or longer is needed ferret can not be housed in environment such a an aquarium because of the poor ventilation it is preferable that the cage have more than one level but this is not crucial usually two to three different shelf are used regulation australia it is illegal to keep ferret a pet in queensland or the northern territory in the australian capital territory a licence is required brazil they are allowed only if they are given a microchip identification tag and sterilized new zealand it ha been illegal to sell distribute or breed ferret in new zealand since unless certain condition are met united state ferret were once banned in many u state but most of these law were rescinded in the and a they became popular pet ferret are still illegal in california under fish and game code section and the california code of regulation although it is not illegal for veterinarian in the state to treat ferret kept a pet additionally ferret are strictly prohibited a pet under hawaii law because they are potential carrier of the rabies virus the territory of puerto rico ha a similar law ferret are restricted by individual city such a washington dc and new york city which renewed it ban in they are also prohibited on many military base a permit to own a ferret is needed in other area including rhode island illinois and georgia do not require a permit to merely posse a ferret but a permit is required to breed ferret it wa once illegal to own ferret in dallas texas but the current dallas city code for animal includes regulation for the vaccination of ferret pet ferret are legal in wisconsin however legality varies by municipality the city of oshkosh for example classifies ferret a a wild animal and subsequently prohibits them from being kept within the city limit also an import permit from the state department of agriculture is required to bring

influenza and have been used to study the swine flu virus smith andrew laidlaw inoculated ferret with human wash which produced a form of influenza that spread to other cage mate the human influenza virus influenza type a wa transmitted from an infected ferret to a junior investigator from whom it wa subsequently ferret have been used in many broad area of research such a the study of pathogenesis and treatment in a variety of human disease these including study into cardiovascular disease nutrition respiratory disease such a sars and human influenza airway physiology cystic fibrosis and gastrointestinal disease because they share many anatomical and physiological feature with human ferret are extensively used a experimental subject in biomedical research in field such a virology reproductive physiology anatomy endocrinology and neuroscience in the uk ferret racing is often a feature of rural fair or festival with people placing small bet on ferret that run set route through pipe and wire mesh although financial bet are placed the event is primarily for entertainment purpose a opposed to betting sport such a horse or greyhound racing terminology and coloring most ferret are either albino with white fur and pink eye or display the typical dark masked sable coloration of their wild polecat ancestor in recent year fancy breeder have produced a wide variety of color and pattern color refers to the color of the ferret guard hair undercoat eye and nose pattern refers to the concentration and distribution of color on the body mask and nose a well a white
