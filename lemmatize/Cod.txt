cod is the common name for the demersal fish genus gadus belonging to the family gadidae cod is also used a part of the common name for a number of other fish specie and one specie that belongs to genus gadus is commonly not called cod alaska pollock gadus chalcogrammus the two most common specie of cod are the atlantic cod gadus morhua which life in the colder water and deeper sea region throughout the north atlantic and the pacific cod gadus macrocephalus found in both eastern and western region of the northern pacific gadus morhua wa named by linnaeus in however g morhua callarias a nonmigratory race restricted to part of the baltic wa originally described a gadus callarias by linnaeus cod is popular a a food with a mild flavour and a dense flaky white flesh cod liver are processed to make cod liver oil an important source of vitamin a vitamin d vitamin e and fatty acid epa and dha young atlantic cod or haddock prepared in strip for cooking is called scrod in the united kingdom atlantic cod is one of the most common ingredient in fish and chip along with haddock and plaice specie at various time in the past taxonomist included many specie in the genus gadus most of these are now either classified in other genus or have been recognized a form of one of three specie all these specie have a number of common name most of them ending with the word cod whereas other specie a closely related have other common name such a pollock and haddock however many other unrelated specie also have common name ending with cod the usage often change with different locality and at different time cod in the genus gadus three specie in the genus gadus are currently called cod the fourth specie of genus gadus gadus chalcogrammus is commonly called alaska pollock or walleye pollock but there are also le widespread alternative trade name highlighting the fish belonging to the cod genus like snow cod or bigeye cod related specie cod form part of the common name of many other fish no longer classified in the genus gadus many are member of the family gadidae others are member of three related family within the order gadiformes whose name include the word cod the morid cod moridae or so specie the eel cod muraenolepididae four specie and the eucla cod euclichthyidae one specie the tadpole cod family ranicipitidae ha now been placed in gadidae gadiformes include some fish have common name derived from cod such a codling codlet or tomcod codling is also used a a name for a young cod other specie some fish commonly known a cod are unrelated to gadus part of this name confusion is severely shrunken atlantic cod stock have led to the marketing of cod replacement using culinary name of the form x cod according to culinary rather than phyletic similarity the common name for the following specie have become well established note that all inhabit the southern hemisphere perciformesfish of the order perciformes that are commonly called cod include blue cod parapercis colias eastern freshwater cod maccullochella ikei mary river cod maccullochella peelii mariensis murray cod maccullochella peelii peelii potato cod epinephelus tukula sleepy cod oxyeleotris lineolatus trout cod maccullochella macquariensis the notothen family nototheniidae including antarctic cod dissostichus mawsoni black cod notothenia microlepidota maori cod paranotothenia magellanicarock cod reef cod and coral codalmost all coral cod reef cod or rock cod are also in order perciformes most are better known a grouper and belong to the family serranidae others belong to the nototheniidiae two exception are the australasian red rock cod which belongs to a different order see below and the fish known simply a the rock cod and a soft cod in new zealand lotella rhacina which a noted above actually is related to the true cod it is a morid cod scorpaeniformesfrom the order scorpaeniformes ling cod ophiodon elongatus red rock cod scorpaena papillosa rock cod sebastesophidiiformesthe tadpole cod family ranicipitidae and the eucla cod family euclichthyidae were formerly classified in the order ophidiiformes but are now grouped with the gadiformes marketed a cod some fish that do not have cod in their name are sometimes sold a cod haddock and whiting belong to the same family the gadidae a cod haddock melanogrammus aeglefinus whiting merlangius merlangus characteristic cod of the genus gadus have three rounded dorsal and two anal fin the pelvic fin are small with the first ray extended and are set under the gill cover ie the throat region in front of the pectoral fin the upper jaw extends over the lower jaw which ha a chin barbel the eye are approximately the same a the length of the chin barbel cod have a distinct white lateral line running from the gill slit above the pectoral fin to the base of the caudal or tail fin the back tends to be a greenish to sandy brown and show extensive mottling especially towards the lighter side and white belly dark brown colouration of the back and side is not uncommon especially for individual that have resided in rocky inshore region the atlantic cod can change colour at certain water depth it ha two distinct colour phase and reddish brown it average weight is kilogram pound but specimen weighing up to kg lb have been recorded pacific cod are smaller than atlantic cod and are darker in colour distribution atlantic cod gadus morhua live in the colder water and deeper sea region throughout the north atlantic pacific cod gadus macrocephalus is found in both eastern and western region of the pacificatlantic cod divide into several stock including the north sea faroe iceland east greenland west greenland newfoundland and labrador stock there seems to be little interchange between the stock although migration to their individual breeding ground may involve distance of kilometre statute mile nautical mile or more atlantic cod occupy varied habitat favouring rough ground especially inshore and are demersal in depth between and metre and foot and fathom m ft fathom on average although not uncommonly to depth of m ft fathom off the norwegian and new england coast and on the grand bank of newfoundland cod congregate at certain season in water of m ft fathom depth cod are gregarious and form school although shoaling tends to be a feature of the spawning season life cycle spawning of northeastern atlantic cod occurs between january and april march and april are the peak month at a depth of metre ft in specific spawning ground at water temperature between and and around the uk the major spawning ground are in the middle to southern north sea the start of the bristol channel north of newquay the irish channel both east and west of the isle of man around stornoway and east of helmsdale prespawning courtship involves fin display and male grunting which lead to pairing the male inverts himself beneath the female and the pair swim in circle while spawning the egg are planktonic and hatch between eight and day with larva reaching millimetre inch in length this planktonic phase last some ten week enabling the young cod to increase it body weight by and growing to about cm in the young cod then move to the seabed and change their diet to small benthic crustacean such a isopod and small crab they increase in size to cm in in the first six month cm in by the end of their first year and to cm in by the end of the second growth tends to be le at higher latitude cod reach maturity at about cm in at about to year of age ecology adult cod are active hunter feeding on sand eel whiting haddock small cod squid crab lobster mussel worm mackerel and mollusc in the baltic sea the most important prey specie are herring and sprat many study that analyze the stomach content of these fish indicate that cod is the top predator preying on the herring and sprat sprat form particularly high concentration in the bornholm basin in the southern baltic sea although cod feed primarily on adult sprat sprat tend to prey on the cod egg and larvaecod and related specie are plagued by parasite for example the cod worm lernaeocera branchialis start life a a larva a small crustacean the first host used by the larva is a flatfish or lumpsucker which it capture with grasping hook at the front of it body it penetrates the fish with a thin filament which it us to suck the fish blood the nourished larva then mate on the fish the female larva with her now fertilized egg then find a cod or a fish such a a haddock or whiting there the larva cling to the gill while it metamorphosis into a plump sinusoidal wormlike body with a coiled mass of egg string at the rear the front part of the worm body penetrates the body of the cod until it enters the rear bulb of the host heart there firmly rooted in the cod circulatory system the front part of the parasite develops like the branch of a tree reaching into the main artery in this way the worm extract nutrient from the cod blood remaining safely tucked beneath the cod gill cover until it release a new generation of offspring into the water fishery the northwest atlantic cod quota is ton representing half the available stock while the northeast atlantic quota is ton pacific cod is currently enjoying strong global demand the total allowable catch tac for the gulf of alaska and aleutian island wa ton aquaculture farming of atlantic cod ha received a significant amount of interest due to the overall trend of increasing cod price alongside reduced wild catch however progress in creating large scale farming of cod ha been slow mainly due to bottleneck in the larval production stage where survival and growth are often unpredictable it ha been suggested that this bottleneck may be overcome by ensuring cod larva are fed diet with similar nutritional content a the copepod they feed on in the wild recent example have shown that increasing dietary level of mineral such a selenium iodine and zinc may improve survival biomarkers for health in aquaculture reared cod larva a food cod is popular a a food with a mild flavor and a dense flaky white flesh cod liver are

united kingdom atlantic cod is one of the most common ingredient in fish and chip along with haddock and plaice cod soft liver can be tinned canned and eaten history cod ha been an important economic commodity in international market since the viking period around ad norwegian travelled with dried cod and soon a dried cod market developed in southern europe this market ha lasted for more than year enduring the black death war and other crisis and is still an important norwegian fish trade the portuguese began fishing cod in the century clipfish is widely enjoyed in portugal the basque played an important role in the cod trade and allegedly found the canadian fishing bank before columbus discovery of america the north american east coast developed in part due to the vast cod stock many city in the new england area are located near cod fishing ground the fish wa so important to the history and development of massachusetts the state house of representative hung a wood carving of a codfish known a the sacred cod of massachusetts in it chamber apart from the long history cod differ from most fish because the fishing ground are far from population center the large cod fishery along the coast of north norway and in particular close to the lofoten island have been developed almost uniquely for export depending on sea transport of stockfish over large distance since the introduction of salt dried and salted cod clipfish or in norwegian ha also been exported by the end of the century the hanseatic league dominated trade operation and sea transport with bergen a the most important portwilliam pitt the elder criticizing the treaty of paris in parliament claimed cod wa british gold and that it wa folly to restore newfoundland fishing right to the french in the and century in the new world especially in massachusetts and newfoundland cod became a major commodity creating trade network and exchange in britain tried to gain control over trade between new england and the british caribbean by imposing the molasses act which they believed would eliminate the trade by making it unprofitable the cod trade grew instead because the french were eager to work with the new englanders in a lucrative contraband arrangement in addition to increasing trade the new england settler organized into a codfish aristocracy the colonist rose up against britain tariff on an import in the century iceland a a fishing power and entered the cod war in the late and early century fishing off the european and american coast severely depleted stock and become a major political issue the necessity of restricting catch to allow stock to recover upset the fishing industry and politician who are reluctant to hurt employment collapse of the atlantic northwest cod fishery in the canadian federal minister of fishery and ocean john crosbie declared a moratorium on the northern cod fishery which for the preceding year had largely shaped the life and community of canada eastern coast fishing society interplay with the resource which they depend on fishery transform the ecosystem which push the fishery and society to adapt in the summer of when the northern cod biomass fell to of earlier level canada federal government saw that this relationship had been pushed to the breaking point and declared a moratorium ending the region run with the northern cod observation on the reduced number and size of cod and concern of fisherman and marine biologist wa offered but generally ignored in favour of the uncertain science and harmful federal policy of canada department of fishery and ocean until the undeniable complete collapse of the fishery according to any reasonable analysis the collapse wa first due to massive overfishing second the dependence for maintenance of the fishery itself on the nutrient cycle that wa being disrupted by removal of megaton of biomass from a closed system resulted in the starvation of the residual fish academic have highlighted these
