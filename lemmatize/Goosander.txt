the common merganser north american or goosander eurasian mergus merganser is a large seaduck of river and lake in forested area of europe the northern and central palearctic and north america the common merganser eats fish and nest in hole in tree taxonomy the first formal description of the common merganser wa by the swedish naturalist carl linnaeus in in the tenth edition of his systema naturae he introduced the current binomial name mergus merganser the genus name is a latin word used by pliny and other roman author to refer to an unspecified waterbird and merganser is derived from mergus and anser latin for goose in john james audubon used the name merganser in addition to goosander in his book the bird of americathere are three subspecies differing in only minor detail m m merganser linnaeus found throughout northern europe and northern asiatic russia m m orientalis gould syn m m comatus salvadori found in the central asian mountain slightly larger than m m merganser with a slenderer bill m m americanus cassin found in north america bill than in m m merganser and a black bar crossing the white inner wing visible in flight on male description it is cm in long with a cm in wingspan and a weight of kg lb male average slightly larger than female but with some overlap like other specie in the genus mergus it ha a crest of longer head feather but these usually lie smoothly rounded behind the head not normally forming an erect crest adult male in breeding plumage are easily distinguished the body white with a variable tinge the head black with an iridescent green gloss the rump and tail grey and the wing largely white on the inner half black on the outer half female and male in eclipse plumage july to october are largely grey with a head white chin and white secondary feather on the wing juvenile both sex are similar to adult female but also show a short white stripe between the eye and bill the bill and leg are red to brightest on adult male dullest on juvenile behaviour feeding like the other merganser these piscivorous duck have serrated edge to their bill to help them grip their prey so they are often known a sawbill in addition to fish they take a wide range of other aquatic prey such a mollusc crustacean worm insect larva and amphibian more rarely small mammal and bird may be taken a in other bird with the character the tinge shown variably by male is probably obtained from the carotenoid pigment present in some crustacean and fish when not diving for food they are usually seen swimming on the water surface or resting on rock in midstream or hidden among riverbank vegetation or in winter on the edge of floating icein most place the common merganser is a much a frequenter of salt water a fresh water in larger stream and river they float down with the stream for a few mile and either fly back again or more commonly fish their way back diving incessantly the whole way in smaller stream they are present in pair or smaller group and they float down twisting round and round in the rapid or fishing vigorously in a deep pool near the foot of a waterfall or rapid when floating leisurely they position themselves in water similar to duck but they also swim deep in water like cormorant especially when swimming upstream they often sit on a rock in the middle of the water similar to cormorant often their wing to the sun to rise from water they flap along the surface for many yard once they are airborne the flight is strong and rapid they often fish in a group forming a semicircle and driving the fish into shallow water where they are captured easily their ordinary voice is a low harsh croak but during the breeding season they including the young make a plaintive soft whistle generally they are wary and one or more bird stay on sentry duty to warn the flock of approaching danger when disturbed they often disgorge food before moving though they move clumsily on land they resort to running when pressed assuming a very upright position similar to penguin and falling and stumbling frequently breeding nesting is normally in a tree cavity so it requires mature forest a it breeding habitat they also readily use large nest box where provided requiring an entrance hole cm in in diameter in place devoid of tree like central asian mountain they use hole in cliff and steep high bank sometimes at considerable distance from the water the female lay most often white to yellowish egg and raise one brood in a season the duckling are taken by their mother in her bill to river or lake immediately after hatching where they feed on freshwater invertebrate and small fish fry fledging when day old the young are sexually mature at the age of two year common merganser are known to form creche with single female having being observed with over duckling at one time movement the specie is a partial migrant with bird moving away from area where river and major lake freeze in the winter but resident where water remain open eastern north american bird move south in small group to the united state wherever ice free condition exist on lake and river on the milder pacific coast they are permanent resident scandinavian and russian bird also migrate southward but western european bird and a few in japan are largely resident in some population the male also show distinct moult migration leaving the breeding area a soon a the young hatch to spend the summer june to september elsewhere notably most of the western european male population migrates north to estuary in finnmark in northern norway principally tanafjord to moult leaving the female to care for the duckling much smaller number of male also use estuary in eastern scotland a a moulting area status and conservation overall the specie is not threatened though illegal persecution by game fishing interest is a problem in some area in february a rare goosander siting wa documented in central park new york the bird wa in obvious distress with it beak being trapped by a piece of debriswithin western europe a marked southward spread ha occurred from scandinavia in the breeding range since about colonising scotland in england in and also a strong increase in the population in the alp they are very scarce in ireland with regular breeding confined to a few pair in county wicklowthe goosander is one of the specie to which the
