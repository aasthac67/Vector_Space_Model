butterfly are insect in the macrolepidopteran clade rhopalocera from the order lepidoptera which also includes moth adult butterfly have large often brightly coloured wing and conspicuous fluttering flight the group comprises the large superfamily papilionoidea which contains at least one former group the skipper formerly the superfamily hesperioidea and the most recent analysis suggest it also contains the formerly the superfamily hedyloidea butterfly fossil date to the paleocene about million year ago butterfly have the typical insect life cycle winged adult lay egg on the food plant on which their larva known a caterpillar will feed the caterpillar grow sometimes very rapidly and when fully developed pupate in a chrysalis when metamorphosis is complete the pupal skin split the adult insect climb out and after it wing have expanded and dried it fly off some butterfly especially in the tropic have several generation in a year while others have a single generation and a few in cold location may take several year to pas through their entire life cycle butterfly are often polymorphic and many specie make use of camouflage mimicry and aposematism to evade their predator some like the monarch and the painted lady migrate over long distance many butterfly are attacked by parasite or parasitoids including wasp protozoan fly and other invertebrate or are preyed upon by other organism some specie are pest because in their larval stage they can damage domestic crop or tree other specie are agent of pollination of some plant larva of a few butterfly eg harvester eat harmful insect and a few are predator of ant while others live a mutualists in association with ant culturally butterfly are a popular motif in the visual and literary art etymology the oxford english dictionary derives the word straightforwardly from old english butorfleoge similar name in old dutch and old high german show that the name is ancient a possible source of the name is the bright yellow male of the brimstone gonepteryx rhamni another is that butterfly were on the wing in meadow during the spring and summer butter season while the grass wa growing taxonomy and phylogeny the earliest lepidoptera fossil are of a small moth archaeolepis mane of jurassic age around million year ago mya butterfly evolved from moth so while the butterfly are monophyletic forming a single clade the moth are not the oldest butterfly are from the palaeocene moclay or fur formation of denmark approximately million year old the oldest american butterfly is the late eocene prodryas persephone from the florissant fossil bed approximately million year oldtraditionally butterfly have been divided into the superfamily papilionoidea excluding the smaller group of the hesperiidae skipper and the more hedylidae of america phylogenetic analysis suggests that the traditional papilionoidea is paraphyletic with respect to the other two group so they should both be included within papilionoidea to form a single butterfly group thereby synonymous with the clade rhopalocera biology general description butterfly adult are characterized by their four wing which give the lepidoptera their name ancient greek lepis lepis scale pteron pteron wing these scale give butterfly wing their colour they are pigmented with melanin that give them black and brown a well a uric acid derivative and flavone that give them yellow but many of the blue green red and iridescent colour are created by structural coloration produced by the of the scale and hairsas in all insect the body is divided into three section the head thorax and abdomen the thorax is composed of three segment each with a pair of leg in most family of butterfly the antenna are clubbed unlike those of moth which may be threadlike or feathery the long proboscis can be coiled when not in use for sipping nectar from flowersnearly all butterfly are diurnal have relatively bright colour and hold their wing vertically above their body when at rest unlike the majority of moth which fly by night are often cryptically coloured well camouflaged and either hold their wing flat touching the surface on which the moth is standing or fold them closely over their body some moth such a the hummingbird are exception to these rule butterfly larva caterpillar have a hard sclerotised head with strong mandible used for cutting their food most often leaf they have cylindrical body with ten segment to the abdomen generally with short prolegs on segment and the three pair of true leg on the thorax have five segment each many are well camouflaged others are aposematic with bright colour and bristly projection containing toxic chemical obtained from their food plant the pupa or chrysalis unlike that of moth is not wrapped in a cocoonmany butterfly are sexually dimorphic most butterfly have the zw system where female are the heterogametic sex zw and male homogametic zz distribution and migration butterfly are distributed worldwide except antarctica totalling some specie of these are nearctic neotropical palearctic afrotropical and are distributed across the combined oriental and region the monarch butterfly is native to the america but in the nineteenth century or before spread across the world and is now found in australia new zealand other part of oceania and the iberian peninsula it is not clear how it dispersed adult may have been blown by the wind or larva or pupa may have been accidentally transported by human but the presence of suitable host plant in their new environment wa a necessity for their successful establishment many butterfly such a the painted lady monarch and several danaine migrate for long distance these migration take place over a number of generation and no single individual completes the whole trip the eastern north american population of monarch can travel thousand of mile to overwintering site in mexico there is a reverse migration in the spring it ha recently been shown that the british painted lady undertakes a round trip in a series of step by up to six successive generation from tropical africa to the arctic circle almost double the length of the famous migration undertaken by monarch spectacular migration associated with the monsoon are seen in peninsular india migration have been studied in more recent time using wing tag and also using stable hydrogen isotopesbutterflies navigate using a sun compass they can see polarized light and therefore orient even in cloudy condition the polarized light near the ultraviolet spectrum appears to be particularly important many migratory butterfly live in area where breeding season are short the life history of their host plant also influence butterfly behaviour life cycle butterfly in their adult stage can live from a week to nearly a year depending on the specie many specie have long larval life stage while others can remain dormant in their pupal or egg stage and thereby survive winter the melissa arctic oeneis melissa overwinters twice a a caterpillar butterfly may have one or more brood per year the number of generation per year varies from temperate to tropical region with tropical region showing a trend towards multivoltinism courtship is often aerial and often involves pheromone butterfly then land on the ground or on a perch to mate copulation take place and may last from minute to hour simple photoreceptor cell located at the genitals are important for this and other adult behaviour the male pass a spermatophore to the female to reduce sperm competition he may cover her with his scent or in some specie such a the apollo parnassius plug her genital opening to prevent her from mating againthe vast majority of butterfly have a life cycle egg larva caterpillar pupa chrysalis and imago adult in the genus colias erebia euchloe and parnassius a small number of specie are known that reproduce when the female dy a partially developed larva emerges from her abdomen egg butterfly egg are protected by a outer layer of shell called the chorion this is lined with a thin coating of wax which prevents the egg from drying out before the larva ha had time to fully develop each egg contains a number of tiny opening at one end called micropyle the purpose of these hole is to allow sperm to enter and fertilize the egg butterfly egg vary greatly in size and shape between specie but are usually upright and finely sculptured some specie lay egg singly others in batch many female produce between one hundred and two hundred eggsbutterfly egg are fixed to a leaf with a special glue which hardens rapidly a it hardens it contract deforming the shape of the egg this glue is easily seen surrounding the base of every egg forming a meniscus the nature of the glue ha been little researched but in the case of pieris brassicae it begin a a pale yellow granular secretion containing acidophilic protein this is viscous and darkens when exposed to air becoming a rubbery material which soon set solid butterfly in the genus agathymus do not fix their egg to a leaf instead the newly laid egg fall to the base of the planteggs are almost invariably laid on plant each specie of butterfly ha it own host plant range and while some specie of butterfly are restricted to just one specie of plant others use a range of plant specie often including member of a common family in some specie such a the great spangled fritillary the egg are deposited close to but not on the food plant this most likely happens when the egg overwinters before hatching and where the host plant loses it leaf in winter a do violet in this examplethe egg stage last a few week in most butterfly but egg laid close to winter especially in temperate region go through a diapause resting stage and the hatching may take place only in spring some temperate region butterfly such a the camberwell beauty lay their egg in the spring and have them hatch in the summer caterpillar larva butterfly larva or caterpillar consume plant leaf and spend practically all of their time searching for and eating food although most caterpillar are herbivorous a few specie are predator spalgis epius eats scale insect while lycaenid such a liphyra brassolis are myrmecophilous eating ant larva some larva especially those of the lycaenidae form mutual association with ant they communicate with the ant using vibration that are transmitted through the substrate a well a using chemical signal the ant provide some degree of protection to these larva and they in turn gather honeydew secretion large blue phengaris arion caterpillar trick myrmica ant into taking them back to the ant colony where they feed on the ant egg and larva in a parasitic relationship caterpillar mature through a series of developmental stage known a instar near the end of each stage the larva undergoes a process called apolysis mediated by the release of a series of neurohormone during this phase the cuticle a tough outer layer made of a mixture of chitin and specialized protein is released from the softer epidermis beneath and the epidermis begin to form a new cuticle at the end of each instar the larva moult the old cuticle split and the new cuticle expands rapidly hardening and developing pigment development of butterfly wing pattern begin by the last larval instar caterpillar have short antenna and several simple eye the mouthpart are adapted for chewing with powerful mandible and a pair of maxilla each with a segmented palp adjoining these is the which house a tubular spinneret which is able to extrude silk caterpillar such a those in the genus calpodes family hesperiidae have a specialized tracheal system on the segment that function a a primitive lung butterfly caterpillar have three pair of true leg on the thoracic segment and up to six pair of prolegs arising from the abdominal segment these prolegs have ring of tiny hook called crochet that are engaged hydrostatically and help the caterpillar grip the substrate the epidermis bear tuft of seta the position and number of which help in identifying the specie there is also decoration in the form of hair protuberance protuberance and spine internally most of the body cavity is taken up by the gut but there may also be large silk gland and special gland which secrete distasteful or toxic substance the developing wing are present in later stage instar and the gonad start development in the egg stage pupa when the larva is fully grown hormone such a prothoracicotropic hormone ptth are produced at this point the larva stop feeding and begin wandering in the quest for a suitable pupation site often the underside of a leaf or other concealed location there it spin a button of silk which it us to fasten it body to the surface and moult for a final time while some caterpillar spin a cocoon to protect the pupa most specie do not the naked pupa often known a a chrysalis usually hang head down from the cremaster a spiny pad at the posterior end but in some specie a silken girdle may be spun to keep the pupa in a position most of the tissue and cell of the larva are broken down inside the pupa a the constituent material is rebuilt into the imago the structure of the transforming insect is visible from the exterior with the wing folded flat on the ventral surface and the two half of the proboscis with the antenna and the leg between themthe pupal transformation into a butterfly through metamorphosis ha held great appeal to mankind to transform from the miniature wing visible on the outside of the pupa into large structure usable for flight the pupal wing undergo rapid mitosis and absorb a great deal of nutrient if one wing is surgically removed early on the other three will grow to a larger size in the pupa the wing form a structure that becomes compressed from top to bottom and pleated from proximal to distal end a it grows so that it can rapidly be unfolded to it full adult size several boundary seen in the adult colour pattern are marked by change in the expression of particular transcription factor in the early pupa adult the reproductive stage of the insect is the winged adult or imago the surface of both butterfly and moth is covered by scale each of which is an outgrowth from a single epidermal cell the head is small and dominated by the two large compound eye these are capable of distinguishing flower shape or motion but can not view distant object clearly colour perception is good especially in some specie in the range the antenna are composed of many segment and have clubbed tip unlike moth that have tapering or feathery antenna the sensory receptor are concentrated in the tip and can detect odour taste receptor are located on the palps and on the foot the mouthpart are adapted to sucking and the mandible are usually reduced in size or absent the first maxilla are elongated into a tubular proboscis which is curled up at rest and expanded when needed to feed the first and second maxilla bear palps which function a sensory organ some specie have a reduced proboscis or maxillary palps and do not feed a adultsmany heliconius butterfly also use their proboscis to feed on pollen in these specie only of the amino acid used in reproduction come from larval feeding which allow them to develop more quickly a caterpillar and give them a longer lifespan of several month a adultsthe thorax of the butterfly is devoted to locomotion each of the three thoracic segment ha two leg among nymphalid the first pair is reduced and the insect walk on four leg the second and third segment of the thorax bear the wing the leading edge of the forewing have thick vein to strengthen them and the hindwings are smaller and more rounded and have fewer stiffening vein the forewing and hindwings are not hooked together a they are in moth but are coordinated by the friction of their overlapping part the front two segment have a pair of spiracle which are used in respirationthe abdomen consists of ten segment and contains the gut and genital organ the front eight segment have spiracle and the terminal segment is modified for reproduction the male ha a pair of clasping organ attached to a ring structure and during copulation a tubular structure is extruded and inserted into the female vagina a spermatophore is deposited in the female following which the sperm make their way to a seminal receptacle where they are stored for later use in both sex the genitalia are adorned with various spine teeth scale and bristle which act to prevent the butterfly from mating with an insect of another specie after it emerges from it pupal stage a butterfly can not fly until the wing are unfolded a newly emerged butterfly need to spend some time inflating it wing with hemolymph and letting them dry during which time it is extremely vulnerable to predator behaviour butterfly feed primarily on nectar from flower some also derive nourishment from pollen tree sap rotting fruit dung decaying flesh and dissolved mineral in wet sand or dirt butterfly are important a pollinator for some specie of plant in general they do not carry a much pollen load a bee but they are capable of moving pollen over greater distance flower constancy ha been observed for at least one specie of butterflyadult butterfly consume only liquid ingested through the proboscis they sip water from damp patch for hydration and feed on nectar from flower from which they obtain sugar for energy and sodium and other mineral vital for reproduction several specie of butterfly need more sodium than that provided by nectar and are attracted by sodium in salt they sometimes land on people attracted by the salt in human sweat some butterfly also visit dung and scavenge rotting fruit or carcass to obtain mineral and nutrient in many specie this behaviour is restricted to the male and study have suggested that the nutrient collected may be provided a a nuptial gift along with the spermatophore during matingin hilltopping male of some specie seek hilltop and ridge top which they patrol in search for female since it usually occurs in specie with low population density it is assumed these landscape point are used a meeting place to find matesbutterflies use their antenna to sense the air for wind and scent the antenna come in various shape and colour the hesperiids have a pointed angle or hook to the antenna while most other family show knobbed antenna the antenna are richly covered with sensory organ known a sensillae a butterfly sense of taste is coordinated by chemoreceptor on the tarsus or foot which work only on contact and are used to determine whether an insect offspring will be able to feed on a leaf before egg are laid on it many butterfly use chemical signal pheromone some have specialized scent scale androconia or other structure coremata or hair pencil in the danaidae vision is well developed in butterfly and most specie are sensitive to the ultraviolet spectrum many specie show sexual dimorphism in the pattern of uv reflective patch colour vision may be widespread but ha been demonstrated in only a few specie some butterfly have organ of hearing and some specie make stridulatory and clicking sound many specie of butterfly maintain territory and actively chase other specie or individual that may stray into them some specie will bask or perch on chosen perch the flight style of butterfly are often characteristic and some specie have courtship flight display butterfly can only fly when their temperature is above when it is cool they can position themselves to expose the underside of the wing to the sunlight to heat themselves up if their body temperature reach they can orientate themselves with the folded wing edgewise to the sun basking is an activity which is more common in the cooler hour of the morning some specie have evolved dark wingbases to help in gathering more heat and this is especially evident in alpine formsas in many other insect the lift generated by butterfly is more than can be accounted for by aerodynamics study using vanessa atalanta in a wind tunnel show that they use a wide variety of aerodynamic mechanism to generate force these include wake capture vortex at the wing edge rotational mechanism and the mechanism butterfly are able to change from one mode to another rapidly ecology parasitoids predator and pathogen butterfly are threatened in their early stage by parasitoids and in all stage by predator disease and environmental factor braconid and other parasitic wasp lay their egg in lepidopteran egg or larva and the wasp parasitoid larva devour their host usually pupating inside or outside the desiccated husk most wasp are very specific about their host specie and some have been used a biological control of pest butterfly like the large white butterfly when the small cabbage white wa accidentally introduced to new zealand it had no natural enemy in order to control it some pupa that had been parasitised by a chalcid wasp were imported and natural control wa thus regained some fly lay their egg on the outside of caterpillar and the newly hatched fly larva bore their way through the skin and feed in a similar way to the parasitoid wasp larva predator of butterfly include ant spider wasp and birdscaterpillars are also affected by a range of bacterial viral and fungal disease and only a small percentage of the butterfly egg laid ever reach adulthood the bacterium bacillus thuringiensis ha been used in spray to reduce damage to crop by the caterpillar of the large white butterfly and the entomopathogenic fungus beauveria bassiana ha proved effective for the same purpose endangered specie queen alexandra birdwing is the largest butterfly in the world the specie is endangered and is one of only three insect the other two being butterfly a well to be listed on appendix i of cite making international trade illegalblack butterfly ocybadistes knightorum is a butterfly of the family hesperiidae it is endemic to new south wale it ha a very limited distribution in the boambee area defence butterfly protect themselves from predator by a variety of mean chemical defence are widespread and are mostly based on chemical of plant origin in many case the plant themselves evolved these toxic substance a protection against herbivore butterfly have evolved mechanism to sequester these plant toxin and use them instead in their own defence these defence mechanism are effective only if they are well advertised this ha led to the evolution of bright colour in unpalatable butterfly aposematism this signal is commonly mimicked by other butterfly usually only female a batesian mimic imitates another specie to enjoy the protection of that specie aposematism the common mormon of india ha female morphs which imitate the unpalatable swallowtail the common rose and the crimson rose mullerian mimicry occurs when aposematic specie evolve to resemble each other presumably to reduce predator sampling rate heliconius butterfly from the america are a good example camouflage is found in many butterfly some like the oakleaf butterfly and autumn leaf are remarkable imitation of leaf a caterpillar many defend themselves by freezing and appearing like stick or branch others have deimatic behaviour such a rearing up and waving their front end which are marked with eyespot a if they were snake some papilionid caterpillar such a the giant swallowtail papilio cresphontes resemble bird droppings so a to be passed over by predator some caterpillar have hair and bristly structure that provide protection while others are gregarious and form dense aggregation some specie are myrmecophile forming mutualistic association with ant and gaining their protection behavioural defence include perching and angling the wing to reduce shadow and avoid being conspicuous some female nymphalid butterfly guard their egg from parasitoidal waspsthe lycaenidae have a false head consisting of eyespot and small tail false antenna to deflect attack from the more vital head region these may also cause ambush predator such a spider to approach from the wrong end enabling the butterfly to detect attack promptly many butterfly have eyespot on the wing these too may deflect attack or may serve to attract matesauditory defence can also be used which in the case of the grizzled skipper refers to vibration generated by the butterfly upon expanding it wing in an attempt to communicate with ant predatorsmany tropical butterfly have seasonal form for dry and wet season these are switched by the hormone ecdysone the form are usually more cryptic perhaps offering better camouflage when vegetation is scarce dark colour in form may help to absorb solar radiationbutterflies without defence such a toxin or mimicry protect themselves through a flight that is more bumpy and unpredictable than in other specie it is assumed this behavior make it more difficult for predator to catch them and is caused by the turbulence created by the small whirlpool formed by the wing during flight in culture in art and literature butterfly have appeared in art from year ago in ancient egypt in the ancient mesoamerican city of teotihuacan the brilliantly coloured image of the butterfly wa carved into many temple building jewellery and emblazoned on incense burner the butterfly wa sometimes depicted with the maw of a jaguar and some specie were considered to be the reincarnation of the soul of dead warrior the close association of butterfly with fire and warfare persisted into the aztec civilisation evidence of similar image ha been found among the zapotec and maya civilisationsbutterflies are widely used in object of art and jewellery mounted in frame embedded in resin displayed in bottle laminated in paper and used in some mixed medium artwork and furnishing the norwegian naturalist kjell sandved compiled a photographic butterfly alphabet containing all letter and the numeral to from the wing of butterfly sir john tenniel drew a famous illustration of alice meeting a caterpillar for lewis carroll alice in wonderland c the caterpillar is seated on a toadstool and is smoking a hookah the image can be read a showing either the foreleg of the larva or a suggesting a face with protruding nose and chin eric carle child book the very hungry caterpillar portrays the larva a an extraordinarily hungry animal while also teaching child how to count to five and the day of the weekone of the most popular and most often

romantic young japanese bride who is deserted by her american officer husband soon after they are married it wa based on john luther long short story written in in mythology and folklore according to lafcadio hearn a butterfly wa seen in japan a the personification of a person soul whether they be living dying or already dead one japanese superstition say that if a butterfly enters your guest room and perch behind the bamboo screen the person whom you most love is coming to see you large number of butterfly are viewed a bad omen when taira no masakado wa secretly preparing for his famous revolt there appeared in kyoto so vast a swarm of butterfly that the people were the apparition to be a portent of coming evil diderot encyclopedie cite butterfly a a symbol for the soul a roman sculpture depicts a butterfly exiting the mouth of a dead man representing the roman belief that the soul leaf through the mouth in line with this the ancient greek word for butterfly is psukhe psyche which primarily mean soul or mind according to mircea eliade some of the naga of manipur claim ancestry from a butterfly in some culture butterfly symbolise rebirth the butterfly is a symbol of being transgender because of the transformation from caterpillar to winged adult in the english county of devon people once hurried to kill the first butterfly of the year to avoid a year of bad luck in the philippine a lingering black butterfly or moth in the house is taken to mean a death in the family several american state have chosen an official state butterfly collecting recording and rearing collecting butterfly wa once a popular hobby it ha now largely been replaced by photography recording and rearing butterfly for release into the wild the zoological illustrator frederick william frohawk succeeded in rearing all the butterfly specie found in britain at a rate of four per year to enable him to draw every stage of each specie he published the result in the folio sized handbook
