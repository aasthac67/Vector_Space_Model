anteater is a common name for the four extant mammal specie of the suborder vermilingua meaning worm tongue commonly known for eating ant and termite the individual specie have other name in english and other language together with the sloth they are within the order pilosa the name anteater is also colloquially applied to the unrelated aardvark numbat echidna pangolin and some member of the oecobiidae extant specie are the giant anteater myrmecophaga tridactyla about m ft in long including the tail the silky anteater cyclops didactylus about cm in long the southern tamandua or collared anteater tamandua tetradactyla about m ft in long and the northern tamandua tamandua mexicana of similar dimension taxonomy classification the anteater are more closely related to the sloth than they are to any other group of mammal their next closest relation are armadillo there are four extant specie in three genus giant anteater myrmecophaga tridactyla silky anteater cyclops didactylus northern tamandua mexicana and southern tamandua tamandua tetradactyla there are several extinct genus a well order pilosa suborder folivora sloth suborder vermilingua anteater family cyclopedidae genus

tetradactyla genus ameghino incertae sedis genus ameghino patagonica genus ameghino mixtus evolution anteater are one of three surviving family of a once diverse group of mammal that occupied south america while it wa geographically isolated from an invasion of animal from north america the other two being the sloth and the armadillo at one time anteater were assumed to be related to aardvark and pangolin because of their physical similarity to those animal but these similarity have since been determined to be not a sign of a common ancestor but of convergent evolution all have evolved powerful digging forearm long tongue and toothless snout to subsist by raiding termite mound this similarity is the reason aardvark are also commonly called anteater the pangolin ha been called the scaly anteater and the word antbear is a common term for both the aardvark and the giant anteater physical characteristic all anteater have elongated snout equipped with a thin tongue that can be extended to a length greater than the length of the head their mouth have lip but no teeth they use their large curved foreclaws to tear open ant and termite mound and for defense while their dense and long fur protects them from attack from the insect all specie except the giant anteater have a long prehensile tail behaviour anteater are mostly solitary mammal prepared to defend their to to territory they do not normally enter a territory of another anteater of the same sex but male often enter the territory of associated female when a territorial dispute occurs they vocalize swat and can sometimes sit on or even ride the back of their opponentsanteaters have poor sight but an excellent sense of smell and most specie depend on the latter for foraging feeding and defence their hearing is thought to be goodwith a body temperature fluctuating between and and anteater like other xenarthrans have among the lowest body temperature of any mammal and can tolerate greater fluctuation in body temperature than most mammal it daily energy intake from food is only slightly greater than it energy need for daily activity and anteater probably coordinate their body temperature so they keep cool during period of rest and heat up during foraging reproduction adult male are slightly larger and more muscular than female and have wider head and neck visual sex determination can however be difficult since the penis and testis are located internally between the rectum and urinary bladder in male and female have a single pair of mamma near the armpit fertilization occurs by contact transfer without intromission similar to some lizard polygynous mating usually result in a single offspring twin are possible but rare the large foreclaws prevent mother from grasping their newborn and they therefore have to carry the offspring until they are feeding anteater are specialized to feed on small insect with each anteater specie having it own insect preference small specie are specialized on arboreal insect living on small branch while large specie can penetrate the hard covering of the nest of terrestrial insect to avoid the jaw sting and other defence of the invertebrate anteater have adopted the feeding strategy of licking up large number of ant and termite a quickly a possible an anteater normally spends about a minute at a nest before moving on to another and a giant anteater ha to visit up to nest per day to consume the thousand of insect it need to satisfy it caloric requirementsthe anteater tongue is covered with thousand of tiny hook called filiform papilla which are used to hold the insect together with large amount of saliva swallowing and the movement of the tongue are aided by movement of the jaw the tongue is attached to the sternum and move very quickly flicking time per minute the anteater stomach similar to a bird gizzard ha hardened fold and us strong contraction to grind the insect a digestive process assisted by small amount of ingested sand and dirt distribution range silky anteater and northern tamandua extend their range a far north a southeastern mexico while giant anteater can be found a far north a central america southern tamandua range south to uruguay giant anteater did also until their recent extirpation there and the range of all specie except the northern tamandua overlap in eastern brazil anteater were confined to south america which wa formerly an island continent during most of the cenozoic era once the isthmus of panama formed about three million year ago however anteater expanded their range into central america a part of the great american interchange habitat anteater habitat include dry tropical forest rainforest grassland and savanna the silky anteater cyclops didactylus is specialized to an arboreal environment but the more opportunistic tamandua find their food both on the ground and in tree typically in dry forest near stream and lake the almost entirely terrestrial giant anteater myrmecophaga tridactyla life in savannasthe two anteater of the genus tamandua the southern tamandua tetradactyla and the northern tamandua tamandua mexicana are much smaller than the giant anteater and differ essentially from it in their habit being mainly arboreal they inhabit the dense primeval forest of south and central america the usual colour is with a broad black lateral band covering nearly the whole of the side of the bodythe silky anteater cyclops didactylus is a native of the hottest part of south and central america and about the size of a cat of a general yellowish color and exclusively arboreal in it habit note reference grzimek bernhard hutchins michael kleiman devra g geist valerius mcdade melissa s ed grzimek animal life encyclopedia
