eagle is the common name for many large bird of prey of the familia accipitridae eagle belong to several group of genus not all of which are closely related most of the specie of eagle are from eurasia and africa outside this area just specie can be in north america in central and south america and in australia description eagle are large powerfully built bird of prey with heavy head and beak even the smallest eagle such a the booted eagle aquila pennata which is comparable in size to a common buzzard buteo buteo or hawk b jamaicensis have relatively longer and more evenly broad wing and more direct faster flight despite the reduced size of aerodynamic feather most eagle are larger than any other raptor apart from some vulture the smallest specie of eagle is the south nicobar serpent eagle spilornis klossi at g lb and cm in the largest specie are discussed below like all bird of prey eagle have very large hooked beak for ripping flesh from their prey strong muscular leg and powerful talon the beak is typically heavier than that of most other bird of prey eagle eye are extremely powerful it is estimated that the martial eagle whose eye is more than twice a long a a human eye ha a visual acuity to time that of human this acuity enables eagle to spot potential prey from a very long distance this keen eyesight is primarily attributed to their extremely large pupil which ensure minimal diffraction scattering of the incoming light the female of all known specie of eagle is larger than the maleeagles normally build their nest called eyry in tall tree or on high cliff many specie lay two egg but the older larger chick frequently kill it younger sibling once it ha hatched the dominant chick tends to be a female a they are bigger than the male the parent take no action to stop the killingdue to the size and power of many eagle specie they are ranked at the top of the food chain a apex predator in the avian world the type of prey varies by genus the haliaeetus and ichthyophaga eagle prefer to capture fish though the specie in the former often capture various animal especially other water bird and are powerful kleptoparasites of other bird the snake and serpent eagle of the genus circaetus terathopius and spilornis predominantly prey on the great diversity of snake found in the tropic of africa and asia the eagle of the genus aquila are often the top bird of prey in open habitat taking almost any vertebrate they can catch where aquila eagle are absent other eagle such a the buteonine of south america may assume the position of top raptorial predator in open area many other eagle including the genus spizaetus live predominantly in woodland and forest these eagle often target various arboreal or mammal and bird which are often unsuspectingly ambushed in such dense knotty environment hunting technique differ among the specie and genus with some individual eagle having engaged in quite varied technique based their environment and prey at any given time most eagle grab prey without landing and take flight with it so the prey can be carried to a perch and torn apartthe bald eagle is noted for having flown with the heaviest load verified to be carried by any flying bird since one eagle flew with a kg lb mule deer fawn however a few eagle may target prey considerably heavier than themselves such prey is too heavy to fly with thus it is either eaten at the site of the kill or taken in piece back to a perch or nest golden and crowned eagle have killed ungulate weighing up to kg lb and a martial eagle even killed a kg lb duiker time heavier than the preying eagle author on bird david allen sibley pete dunne and clay sutton described the behavioral difference between hunting eagle and other bird of prey thus in this case the bald and golden eagle a compared to other north american raptor they have at least one singular characteristic it ha been observed that most bird of prey look back over their shoulder before striking prey or shortly thereafter predation is after all a sword all hawk seem to have this habit from the smallest kestrel to the largest ferruginous but not the eagle among the eagle are some of the largest bird of prey only the condor and some of the old world vulture are markedly larger it is regularly debated which should be considered the largest specie of eagle they could be measured variously in total length body mass or wingspan different lifestyle need among various eagle result in variable measurement from specie to specie for example many eagle including the very large harpy eagle have relatively short wingspan a feature necessary for being able to maneuver in quick short burst through densely forested habitat eagle in the genus aquila though found almost strictly in open country are superlative soarers and have relatively long wing for their sizethese list of the top five eagle are based on weight length and wingspan respectively unless otherwise noted by reference

eagle are often informally divided into four groupsthe snake eagle are placed in the subfamily circaetinae the fish eagle booted eagle and harpy eagle have traditionally been placed in the subfamily buteoninae together with the buteonine hawk and harrier some author may treat these group a tribe of the buteoninae lerner mindell proposed separating the eagle group into their own subfamily of accipitridae fish eagle sea eagle or fish eagle take fish a a large part of their diet either fresh or a carrion proposed subfamily haliaeetinae genus haliaeetus ichthyophaga some author include gypohierax angolensis the vulturine fish eagle also called the vulture in this group however genetic analysis indicate it is related to a grouping of egyptian vulture bearded vulture lammergeier and madagascan serpent eagle the fish eagle have a close genetic relationship with haliastur and milvus the whole group is only distantly related to the buteo group booted eagle booted eagle or true eagle

not related harpy eagle harpy eagle or giant forest eagle are large eagle that inhabit tropical forest the group contains two to six specie depending on the author although these bird occupy similar niche and have traditionally been grouped together they are not all related the solitary eagle are related to the and the philippine eagle to the snake eagle harpy eagle proposed subfamily harpiinae

formerly harpyhaliaetus solitarius south america specie major new research into eagle taxonomy suggests that the important genus aquila and hieraaetus are not composed of nearest relative and it is likely that a reclassification of these genus will soon take place with some specie being moved to lophaetus or ictinaetus bonelli eagle and the african have been moved from hieraaetus to aquila either the greater spotted eagle and lesser spotted eagle should move from aquila to join the eagle in lophaetus or perhaps better all three of these specie should move to ictinaetus with the black

is unknown but it is believed to possibly derive from either aquilus meaning swarthy or blackish a a reference to the plumage of eagle or from aquilo meaning north wind old english used the term earn related to scandinavia it is similar to other term for bird or eagle including greek ornis ornis russian oriol orel and welsh eryr in the southern part of finland near the gulf of finland is the town of kotka which literally mean eagle in britain before eagle referred specifically to the golden eagle with the other native specie the eagle being known a erne the modern name golden eagle for aquila chrysaetos wa introduced by the naturalist john ray religion and folklore in ancient sumerian mythology the mythical king etana wa said to have been carried into heaven by an eagle classical writer such a lucan and pliny the elder claimed that the eagle wa able to look directly at the sun and that they forced their fledgling to do the same those that blinked would be cast from the nest this belief persisted until the medieval erathe eagle is the patron animal of the ancient greek god zeus in particular zeus wa said to have taken the form of an eagle in order to abduct ganymede and there are numerous artistic depiction of the eagle zeus bearing ganymede aloft from classical time up to the present see illustration in the ganymede mythology page psalm in greek latin and english mention renewing one youth a the eagle although the hebrew word nSHr apparently mean vulture augustine of hippo give a curious explanation of this in his commentary on the psalmsthe eagle is a common form in the anglican tradition often used to support the bible because of the symbolism of spreading the gospel over the world additional symbolic meaning for eagle include the pronouncement to the israelite in exodus psalm and isaiah the united state eagle feather law stipulates that only individual of certifiable native american ancestry enrolled in a federally recognized tribe are legally authorized to obtain eagle feather for religious or spiritual reason in canada the poaching of eagle feather for the booming u market ha sometimes resulted in the arrest of first nation person for the crimethe moche people of ancient peru worshiped the eagle and often depicted eagle in their art heraldry eagle are an exceptionally common symbol in heraldry being considered the king of bird in contrast to the lion the king of beast whereas the lion eg england usually represents a kingdom the eagle is symbolic for an empire they are particularly popular in germanic country such a austria due to their association with the holy roman empire the eagle of the holy roman empire wa supposedly representing the two division east and west of the old roman empire this motif derived from the byzantine eastern roman empire wa also adopted by the russian empire and is still featured in the flag of albania the roman eagle wa preceded by the eagle of ptolemaic egypt and the achaemenid empire in the coat of arm of kotka finland the eagle is depicted carrying an anchor and the caduceus on it foot heraldic eagle are most often found displayed ie with their wing and leg extended they can also occur close ie with their wing folded or rising ie about to take flight the head wing and leg of eagle can also be found independently note reference further reading collinson martin splitting headache
