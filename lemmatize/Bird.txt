bird are a group of vertebrate constituting the class aves characterized by feather toothless beaked jaw the laying of egg a high metabolic rate a heart and a strong yet lightweight skeleton bird live worldwide and range in size from the cm in bee hummingbird to the m ft ostrich there are about ten thousand living specie more than half of which are passerine or perching bird bird have wing whose development varies according to specie the only known group without wing are the extinct moa and elephant bird wing which evolved from forelimb gave bird the ability to fly although further evolution ha led to the loss of flight in some bird including ratite penguin and diverse endemic island specie the digestive and respiratory system of bird are also uniquely adapted for flight some bird specie of aquatic environment particularly seabird and some waterbird have further evolved for swimming bird are a group of feathered theropod dinosaur and constitute the only living dinosaur likewise bird are considered reptile in the modern cladistic sense of the term and their closest living relative are the crocodilian bird are descendant of the primitive avialans whose member include archaeopteryx which first appeared about million year ago mya in china according to dna evidence modern bird neornithes evolved in the middle to late cretaceous and diversified dramatically around the time of the extinction event mya which killed off the pterosaur and all dinosaur many social specie pas on knowledge across generation which is considered a form of culture bird are social communicating with visual signal call and song and participating in such behaviour a cooperative breeding and hunting flocking and mobbing of predator the vast majority of bird specie are socially but not necessarily sexually monogamous usually for one breeding season at a time sometimes for year but rarely for life other specie have breeding system that are polygynous one male with many female or rarely polyandrous one female with many male bird produce offspring by laying egg which are fertilised through sexual reproduction they are usually laid in a nest and incubated by the parent most bird have an extended period of parental care after hatching many specie of bird are economically important a food for human consumption and raw material in manufacturing with domesticated and undomesticated bird being important source of egg meat and feather songbird parrot and other specie are popular a pet guano bird excrement is harvested for use a a fertiliser bird figure throughout human culture about to specie have become extinct due to human activity since the century and hundred more before then human activity threatens about bird specie with extinction though effort are underway to protect them recreational birdwatching is an important part of the ecotourism industry evolution and classification the first classification of bird wa developed by francis willughby and john ray in their volume ornithologiaecarl linnaeus modified that work in to devise the taxonomic classification system currently in use bird are categorised a the biological class aves in linnaean taxonomy phylogenetic taxonomy place aves in the dinosaur clade theropoda definition aves and a sister group the order crocodilia contain the only living representative of the reptile clade archosauria during the late aves wa most commonly defined phylogenetically a all descendant of the most recent common ancestor of modern bird and archaeopteryx lithographica however an earlier definition proposed by jacques gauthier gained wide currency in the century and is used by many scientist including adherent of the phylocode system gauthier defined aves to include only the crown group of the set of modern bird this wa done by excluding most group known only from fossil and assigning them instead to the broader group avialae in part to avoid the uncertainty about the placement of archaeopteryx in relation to animal traditionally thought of a theropod dinosaur gauthier and de queiroz identified four different definition for the same biological name aves which is a problem the author proposed to reserve the term aves only for the crown group consisting of the last common ancestor of all living bird and all of it descendant which corresponds to meaning number below he assigned other name to the other group aves can mean all archosaur closer to bird than to crocodile alternately avemetatarsalia aves can mean those advanced archosaur with feather alternately avifilopluma aves can mean those feathered dinosaur that fly alternately avialae aves can mean the last common ancestor of all the currently living bird and all of it descendant a crown group in this sense synonymous with neornithes under the fourth definition archaeopteryx traditionally considered one of the earliest member of aves is removed from this group becoming a dinosaur instead these proposal have been adopted by many researcher in the field of palaeontology and bird evolution though the exact definition applied have been inconsistent avialae initially proposed to replace the traditional fossil content of aves is often used synonymously with the vernacular term bird by these researcher most researcher define avialae a clade though definition vary many author have used a definition similar to all theropod closer to bird than to deinonychus with troodon being sometimes added a a second external specifier in case it is closer to bird than to deinonychus avialae is also occasionally defined a an clade that is one based on physical characteristic jacques gauthier who named avialae in it in a all dinosaur that possessed feathered wing used in flapping flight and the bird that descended from themdespite being currently one of the most widely used the definition of aves ha been criticised by some researcher lee and spencer argued that contrary to what gauthier defended this definition would not increase the stability of the clade and the exact content of aves will always be uncertain because any defined clade either crown or not will have few synapomorphies distinguishing it from it closest relative their alternative definition is synonymous to avifilopluma dinosaur and the origin of bird based on fossil and biological evidence most scientist accept that bird are a specialised subgroup of theropod dinosaur and more specifically they are member of maniraptora a group of theropod which includes dromaeosaurids and oviraptorosaurs among others a scientist have discovered more theropod closely related to bird the previously clear distinction between and bird ha become blurred recent discovery in the liaoning province of northeast china which demonstrate many small theropod feathered dinosaur contribute to this ambiguitythe consensus view in contemporary palaeontology is that the flying theropod or avialans are the closest relative of the deinonychosaurs which include dromaeosaurids and troodontids together these form a group called paraves some basal member of deinonychosauria such a microraptor have feature which may have enabled them to glide or fly the most basal deinonychosaurs were very small this evidence raise the possibility that the ancestor of all paravians may have been arboreal have been able to glide or both unlike archaeopteryx and the feathered dinosaur who primarily ate meat recent study suggest that the first avialans were omnivoresthe late jurassic archaeopteryx is well known a one of the first transitional fossil to be found and it provided support for the theory of evolution in the late century archaeopteryx wa the first fossil to display both clearly traditional reptilian clawed finger and a long well a wing with flight feather similar to those of modern bird it is not considered a direct ancestor of bird though it is possibly closely related to the true ancestor early evolution over of key trait found in modern bird evolved during the million year transition from the earliest archosaur to the first maniraptoromorphs ie the first dinosaur closer to living bird than to tyrannosaurus rex the loss of osteoderms otherwise common in archosaur and acquisition of primitive feather might have occurred early during this phase after the appearance of maniraptoromorpha the next million year marked a continuous reduction of body size and the accumulation of neotenic characteristic hypercarnivory became increasingly le common while braincase enlarged and forelimb became longer the integument evolved into complex pennaceous feathersthe oldest known paravian and probably the earliest avialan fossil come from the tiaojishan formation of china which ha been dated to the late jurassic period oxfordian stage about million year ago the avialan specie from this time period include anchiornis huxleyi xiaotingia zhengi and aurornis xuithe probable early avialan archaeopteryx date from slightly later jurassic rock about million year old from germany many of these early avialans shared unusual anatomical feature that may be ancestral to modern bird but were later lost during bird evolution these feature include enlarged claw on the second toe which may have been held clear of the ground in life and long feather or hind wing covering the hind limb and foot which may have been used in aerial maneuveringavialans diversified into a wide variety of form during the cretaceous period many group retained primitive characteristic such a clawed wing and teeth though the latter were lost independently in a number of avialan group including modern bird aves increasingly stiff tail especially the outermost half can be seen in the evolution of maniraptoromorphs and this process culminated in the appearance of the pygostyle an ossification of fused tail vertebra in the late cretaceous about million year ago the ancestor of all modern bird evolved a more open pelvis allowing them to lay larger egg compared to body size around million year ago they evolved a better sense of smella third stage of bird evolution starting with ornithothoraces the avialans can be associated with the refining of aerodynamics and flight capability and the loss or of several skeletal feature particularly significant are the development of an enlarged keeled sternum and the alula and the loss of grasping hand early diversity of bird ancestor the first large diverse lineage of avialans to evolve were the enantiornithes or opposite bird so named because the construction of their shoulder bone wa in reverse to that of modern bird enantiornithes occupied a wide array of ecological niche from shorebird and to form and while they were the dominant group of avialans during the cretaceous period enantiornithes became extinct along with many other dinosaur group at the end of the mesozoic eramany specie of the second major avialan lineage to diversify the euornithes meaning true bird because they include the ancestor of modern bird were and specialised in eating fish and other small aquatic organism unlike the enantiornithes which dominated and arboreal habitat most early euornithes lacked perching adaptation and seem to have included specie wader and swimming and diving specie the latter included the superficially ichthyornis and the hesperornithiformes which became so well adapted to hunting fish in marine environment that they lost the ability to fly and became primarily aquatic the early euornithes also saw the development of many trait associated with modern bird like strongly keeled breastbone toothless beaked portion of their jaw though most euornithes retained teeth in other part of the jaw euornithes also included the first avialans to develop true pygostyle and a fully mobile fan of tail feather which may have replaced the hind wing a the primary mode of aerial maneuverability and braking in flighta study on mosaic evolution in the avian skull found that the last common ancestor of all neornithes might have had a beak similar to that of the modern vanga and a skull similar to that of the eurasian golden oriole a both specie are small aerial and canopy foraging omnivore a similar ecological niche wa inferred for this hypothetical ancestor diversification of modern bird all modern bird lie within the crown group aves alternately neornithes which ha two subdivision the palaeognathae which includes the flightless ratite such a the ostrich and the tinamou and the extremely diverse neognathae containing all other bird these two subdivision are often given the rank of superorder although livezey and zusi assigned them cohort rank depending on the taxonomic viewpoint the number of known living bird specie varies anywhere from to discovery of vegavis a late cretaceous member of the anatidae proved that the diversification of modern bird started before the cenozoic era the affinity of an earlier fossil the possible galliform austinornis lentus dated to about million year ago are still too controversial to provide a fossil evidence of modern bird diversification most study agree on a cretaceous age for the most recent common ancestor of modern bird but estimate range from the middle cretaceous to the latest late cretaceous similarly there is no agreement on whether most of the early diversification of modern bird occurred before or after the extinction event this disagreement is in part caused by a divergence in the evidence most molecular dating study suggests a cretaceous evolutionary radiation while fossil evidence point to a cenozoic radiation the versus controversy previous attempt to reconcile molecular and fossil evidence have proved controversial but more recent estimate using a more comprehensive sample of fossil and a new way of calibrating molecular clock showed that while modern bird originated early in the late cretaceous a pulse of diversification in all major group occurred around the extinction event classification of bird order cladogram of modern bird relationship based on prum ro et al with some clade name after yuri t et al the classification of bird is a contentious issue sibley and ahlquist phylogeny and classification of bird is a landmark work on the classification of bird although it is frequently debated and constantly revised most evidence seems to suggest the assignment of order is accurate but scientist disagree about the relationship between the order themselves evidence from modern bird anatomy fossil and dna have all been brought to bear on the problem but no strong consensus ha emerged more recently new fossil and molecular evidence is providing an increasingly clear picture of the evolution of modern bird order distribution bird live and breed in most terrestrial habitat and on all seven continent reaching their southern extreme in the snow petrel breeding colony up to kilometre mi inland in antarctica the highest bird diversity occurs in tropical region it wa earlier thought that this high diversity wa the result of higher speciation rate in the tropic however recent study found higher speciation rate in the high latitude that were offset by greater extinction rate than in the tropic many specie migrate annually over great distance and across ocean several family of bird have adapted to life both on the world ocean and in them and some seabird specie come ashore only to breed while some penguin have been recorded diving up to metre ft deepmany bird specie have established breeding population in area to which they have been introduced by human some of these introduction have been deliberate the pheasant for example ha been introduced around the world a a game bird others have been accidental such a the establishment of wild monk parakeet in several north american city after their escape from captivity some specie including cattle egret caracara and galah have spread naturally far beyond their original range a agricultural practice created suitable new habitat anatomy and physiology compared with other vertebrate bird have a body plan that show many unusual adaptation mostly to facilitate flight skeletal system the skeleton consists of very lightweight bone they have large cavity called pneumatic cavity which connect with the respiratory system the skull bone in adult are fused and do not show cranial suture the orbit are large and separated by a bony septum the spine ha cervical thoracic lumbar and caudal region with the number of cervical neck vertebra highly variable and especially flexible but movement is reduced in the anterior thoracic vertebra and absent in the later vertebra the last few are fused with the pelvis to form the synsacrum the rib are flattened and the sternum is keeled for the attachment of flight muscle except in the flightless bird order the forelimb are modified into wing the wing are more or le developed depending on the specie the only known group that lost their wing are the extinct moa and elephant bird excretory system like the reptile bird are primarily uricotelic that is their kidney extract nitrogenous waste from their bloodstream and excrete it a uric acid instead of urea or ammonia through the ureter into the intestine bird do not have a urinary bladder or external urethral opening and with exception of the ostrich uric acid is excreted along with faeces a a semisolid waste however bird such a hummingbird can be facultatively ammonotelic excreting most of the nitrogenous waste a ammonia they also excrete creatine rather than creatinine like mammal this material a well a the output of the intestine emerges from the bird cloaca the cloaca is a opening waste is expelled through it most bird mate by joining cloaca and female lay egg from it in addition many specie of bird regurgitate pelletsit is a common but not universal feature of altricial passerine nestling born helpless under constant parental care that instead of excreting directly into the nest they produce a fecal sac this is a pouch that allows parent to either dispose of the waste outside the nest or to recycle the waste through their own digestive system reproductive system male within palaeognathae with the exception of the kiwi the anseriformes with the exception of screamer and in rudimentary form in galliformes but fully developed in cracidae posse a penis which is never present in neoaves the length is thought to be related to sperm competition when not copulating it is hidden within the proctodeum compartment within the cloaca just inside the vent female bird have sperm storage tubule that allow sperm to remain viable long after copulation a hundred day in some specie sperm from multiple male may compete through this mechanism most female bird have a single ovary and a single oviduct both on the left side but there are exception specie in at least different order of bird have two ovary even these specie however tend to have a single oviduct it ha been speculated that this might be an adaptation to flight but male have two testis and it is also observed that the gonad in both sex decrease dramatically in size outside the breeding season also terrestrial bird generally have a single ovary a doe the platypus an mammal a more likely explanation is that the egg develops a shell while passing through the oviduct over a period of about a day so that if two egg were to develop at the same time there would be a risk to survivalbirds have two sex either female or male the sex of bird is determined by the z and w sex chromosome rather than by the x and y chromosome present in mammal male bird have two z chromosome zz and female bird have a w chromosome and a z chromosome wz in nearly all specie of bird an individual sex is determined at fertilisation however one recent study claimed to demonstrate sex determination among the australian brushturkey for which higher temperature during incubation resulted in a higher sex ratio this however wa later proven to not be the case these bird do not exhibit sex determination but sex mortality respiratory and circulatory system bird have one of the most complex respiratory system of all animal group upon inhalation of the fresh air bypass the lung and flow directly into a posterior air sac which extends from the lung and connects with air space in the bone and fill them with air the other of the air go directly into the lung when the bird exhales the used air flow out of the lung and the stored fresh air from the posterior air sac is simultaneously forced into the lung thus a bird lung receive a constant supply of fresh air during both inhalation and exhalation sound production is achieved using the syrinx a muscular chamber incorporating multiple tympanic membrane which diverges from the lower end of the trachea the trachea being elongated in some specie increasing the volume of vocalisation and the perception of the bird sizein bird the main artery taking blood away from the heart originate from the right aortic arch or pharyngeal arch unlike in the mammal where the left aortic arch form this part of the aorta the postcava receives blood from the limb via the renal portal system unlike in mammal the circulating red blood cell in bird retain their nucleus heart type and feature the avian circulatory system is driven by a myogenic heart contained in a fibrous pericardial sac this pericardial sac is filled with a serous fluid for lubrication the heart itself is divided into a right and left half each with an atrium and ventricle the atrium and ventricle of each side are separated by atrioventricular valve which prevent back flow from one chamber to the next during contraction being myogenic the heart pace is maintained by pacemaker cell found in the sinoatrial node located on the right atrium the sinoatrial node us calcium to cause a depolarising signal transduction pathway from the atrium through right and left atrioventricular bundle which communicates contraction to the ventricle the avian heart also consists of muscular arch that are made up of thick bundle of muscular layer much like a mammalian heart the avian heart is composed of endocardial myocardial and epicardial layer the atrium wall tend to be thinner than the ventricle wall due to the intense ventricular contraction used to pump oxygenated blood throughout the body avian heart are generally larger than mammalian heart when compared to body mass this adaptation allows more blood to be pumped to meet the high metabolic need associated with flight organisation bird have a very efficient system for diffusing oxygen into the blood bird have a ten time greater surface area to gas exchange volume than mammal a a result bird have more blood in their capillary per unit of volume of lung than a mammal the artery are composed of thick elastic muscle to withstand the pressure of the ventricular contraction and become more rigid a they move away from the heart blood move through the artery which undergo vasoconstriction and into arteriole which act a a transportation system to distribute primarily oxygen a well a nutrient to all tissue of the body a the arteriole move away from the heart and into individual organ and tissue they are further divided to increase surface area and slow blood flow blood travel through the arteriole and move into the capillary where gas exchange can occur capillary are organized into capillary bed in tissue it is here that blood exchange oxygen for carbon dioxide waste in the capillary bed blood flow is slowed to allow maximum diffusion of oxygen into the tissue once the blood ha become deoxygenated it travel through venule then vein and back to the heart vein unlike artery are thin and rigid a they do not need to withstand extreme pressure a blood travel through the venule to the vein a funneling occurs called vasodilation bringing blood back to the heart once the blood reach the heart it move first into the right atrium then the right ventricle to be pumped through the lung for further gas exchange of carbon dioxide waste for oxygen oxygenated blood then flow from the lung through the left atrium to the left ventricle where it is pumped out to the body nervous system the nervous system is large relative to the bird size the most developed part of the brain is the one that control the function while the cerebellum coordinate movement and the cerebrum control behaviour pattern navigation mating and nest building most bird have a poor sense of smell with notable exception including kiwi new world vulture and tubenoses the avian visual system is usually highly developed water bird have special flexible lens allowing accommodation for vision in air and water some specie also have dual fovea bird are tetrachromatic possessing ultraviolet uv sensitive cone cell in the eye a well a green red and blue one they also have double cone likely to mediate achromatic visionmany bird show plumage pattern in ultraviolet that are invisible to the human eye some bird whose sex appear similar to the naked eye are distinguished by the presence of ultraviolet reflective patch on their feather male blue tit have an ultraviolet reflective crown patch which is displayed in courtship by posturing and raising of their nape feather ultraviolet light is also used in have been shown to search for prey by detecting the uv reflective urine trail mark left on the ground by rodent with the exception of pigeon and a few other specie the eyelid of bird are not used in blinking instead the eye is lubricated by the nictitating membrane a third eyelid that move horizontally the nictitating membrane also cover the eye and act a a contact lens in many aquatic bird the bird retina ha a fan shaped blood supply system called the pecteneyes of most bird are large not very round and capable of only limited movement in the orbit typically bird with eye on the side of their head have a wide visual field while bird with eye on the front of their head such a owl have binocular vision and can estimate the depth of field the avian ear lack external pinna but is covered by feather although in some bird such a the asio bubo and otus owl these feather form tuft which resemble ear the inner ear ha a cochlea but it is not spiral a in mammal defence and intraspecific combat a few specie are able to use chemical defence against predator some procellariiformes can eject an unpleasant stomach oil against an aggressor and some specie of pitohuis from new guinea have a powerful neurotoxin in their skin and feathersa lack of field observation limit our knowledge but intraspecific conflict are known to sometimes result in injury or death the screamer anhimidae some jacanas jacana hydrophasianus the goose plectropterus the torrent duck merganetta and nine specie of lapwing vanellus use a sharp spur on the wing a a weapon the steamer duck tachyeres goose and swan anserinae the solitaire pezophaps sheathbills chionis some guan crax and stone curlew burhinus use a bony knob on the alular metacarpal to punch and hammer opponent the jacanas actophilornis and irediparra have an expanded radius the extinct xenicibis wa unique in having an elongate forelimb and massive hand which likely functioned in combat or defence a a jointed club or flail swan for instance may strike with the bony spur and bite when defending egg or young feather plumage and scale feather are a feature characteristic of bird though also present in some dinosaur not currently considered to be true bird they facilitate flight provide insulation that aid in thermoregulation and are used in display camouflage and signalling there are several type of feather each serving it own set of purpose feather are epidermal growth attached to the skin and arise only in specific tract of skin called pterylae the distribution pattern of these feather tract pterylosis is used in taxonomy and systematics the arrangement and appearance of feather on the body called plumage may vary within specie by age social status and sexplumage is regularly moulted the standard plumage of a bird that ha moulted after breeding is known a the plumage the basic plumage breeding plumage or variation of the basic plumage are known under the system a alternate plumage moulting is annual in most specie although some may have two moult a year and large bird of prey may moult only once every few year moulting pattern vary across specie in passerine flight feather are replaced one at a time with the innermost primary being the first when the fifth of sixth primary is replaced the outermost tertiary begin to drop after the innermost tertiary are moulted the secondary starting from the innermost begin to drop and this proceeds to the outer feather centrifugal moult the greater primary covert are moulted in synchrony with the primary that they overlapa small number of specie such a duck and goose lose all of their flight feather at once temporarily becoming flightless a a general rule the tail feather are moulted and replaced starting with the innermost pair centripetal moult of tail feather are however seen in the phasianidae the centrifugal moult is modified in the tail feather of woodpecker and treecreepers in that it begin with the second innermost pair of feather and finish with the central pair of feather so that the bird maintains a functional climbing tail the general pattern seen in passerine is that the primary are replaced outward secondary inward and the tail from centre outward before nesting the female of most bird specie gain a bare brood patch by losing feather close to the belly the skin there is well supplied with blood vessel and help the bird in incubation feather require maintenance and bird preen or groom them daily spending an average of around of their daily time on this the bill is used to brush away foreign particle and to apply waxy secretion from the uropygial gland these secretion protect the feather flexibility and act a an antimicrobial agent inhibiting the growth of bacteria this may be supplemented with the secretion of formic acid from ant which bird receive through a behaviour known a anting to remove feather parasitesthe scale of bird are composed of the same keratin a beak claw and spur they are found mainly on the toe and metatarsus but may be found further up on the ankle in some bird most bird scale do not overlap significantly except in the case of kingfisher and woodpecker the scale of bird are thought to be homologous to those of reptile and mammal flight most bird can fly which distinguishes them from almost all other vertebrate class flight is the primary mean of locomotion for most bird specie and is used for searching for food and for escaping from predator bird have various adaptation for flight including a lightweight skeleton two large flight muscle the pectoralis which account for of the total mass of the bird and the supracoracoideus a well a a modified forelimb wing that serf a an aerofoilwing shape and size generally determine a bird flight style and performance many bird combine powered flapping flight with le soaring flight about extant bird specie are flightless a were many extinct bird flightlessness often arises in bird on isolated island probably due to limited resource and the absence of land predator although flightless penguin use similar musculature and movement to fly through the water a do some bird such a auk shearwater and dipper behaviour most bird are diurnal but some bird such a many specie of owl and nightjar are nocturnal or crepuscular active during twilight hour and many coastal wader feed when the tide are appropriate by day or night diet and feeding bird diet are varied and often include nectar fruit plant seed carrion and various small animal including other bird the digestive system of bird is unique with a crop for storage and a gizzard that contains swallowed stone for grinding food to compensate for the lack of teeth most bird are highly adapted for rapid digestion to aid with flight some migratory bird have adapted to use protein stored in many part of their body including protein from the intestine a additional energy during migrationbirds that employ many strategy to obtain food or feed on a variety of food item are called generalist while others that concentrate time and effort on specific food item or have a single strategy to obtain food are considered specialist avian foraging strategy can vary widely by specie many bird glean for insect invertebrate fruit or seed some hunt insect by suddenly attacking from a branch those specie that seek pest insect are considered beneficial control agent and their presence encouraged in biological pest control programme combined insectivorous bird eat million metric ton of arthropod annuallynectar feeder such a hummingbird sunbirds lory and lorikeet amongst others have specially adapted brushy tongue and in many case bill designed to fit flower kiwi and shorebird with long bill probe for invertebrate shorebird varied bill length and feeding method result in the separation of ecological niche loon diving duck penguin and auk pursue their prey underwater using their wing or foot for propulsion while aerial predator such a sulids kingfisher and tern plunge dive after their prey flamingo three specie of prion and some duck are filter feeder goose and dabbling duck are primarily grazers some specie including frigatebirds gull and skua engage in kleptoparasitism stealing food item from other bird kleptoparasitism is thought to be a supplement to food obtained by hunting rather than a significant part of any specie diet a study of great frigatebirds stealing from masked booby estimated that the frigatebirds stole at most of their food and on average stole only other bird are scavenger some of these like vulture are specialised carrion eater while others like gull corvids or other bird of prey are opportunist water and drinking water is needed by many bird although their mode of excretion and lack of sweat gland reduces the physiological demand some desert bird can obtain their water need entirely from moisture in their food they may also have other adaptation such a allowing their body temperature to rise saving on moisture loss from evaporative cooling or panting seabird can drink seawater and have salt gland inside the head that eliminate excess salt out of the nostrilsmost bird scoop water in their beak and raise their head to let water run down the throat some specie especially of arid zone belonging to the pigeon finch mousebird and bustard family are capable of sucking up water without the need to tilt back their head some desert bird depend on water source and sandgrouse are particularly well known for their daily congregation at waterholes nesting sandgrouse and many plover carry water to their young by wetting their belly feather some bird carry water for chick at the nest in their crop or regurgitate it along with food the pigeon family flamingo and penguin have adaptation to produce a nutritive fluid called crop milk that they provide to their chick feather care feather being critical to the survival of a bird require maintenance apart from physical wear and tear feather face the onslaught of fungi ectoparasitic feather mite and bird louse the physical condition of feather are maintained by preening often with the application of secretion from the preen gland bird also bathe in water or dust themselves while some bird dip into shallow water more aerial specie may make aerial dip into water and arboreal specie often make use of dew or rain that collect on leaf bird of arid region make use of loose soil to a behaviour termed a anting in which the bird encourages ant to run through their plumage is also thought to help them reduce the ectoparasite load in feather many specie will spread out their wing and expose them to direct sunlight and this too is thought to help in reducing fungal and ectoparasitic activity that may lead to feather damage migration many bird specie migrate to take advantage of global difference of seasonal temperature therefore optimising availability of food source and breeding habitat these migration vary among the different group many landbirds shorebird and waterbird undertake annual migration usually triggered by the length of daylight a well a weather condition these bird are characterised by a breeding season spent in the temperate or polar region and a season in the tropical region or opposite hemisphere before migration bird substantially increase body fat and reserve and reduce the size of some of their organsmigration is highly demanding energetically particularly a bird need to cross desert and ocean without refuelling landbirds have a flight range of around km mi and shorebird can fly up to km mi although the godwit is capable of flight of up to km mi seabird also undertake long migration the longest annual migration being those of sooty shearwater which nest in new zealand and chile and spend the northern summer feeding in the north pacific off japan alaska and california an annual round trip of km mi other seabird disperse after breeding travelling widely but having no set migration route albatross nesting in the southern ocean often undertake circumpolar trip between breeding season some bird specie undertake shorter migration travelling only a far a is required to avoid bad weather or obtain food irruptive specie such a the boreal finch are one such group and can commonly be found at a location in one year and absent the next this type of migration is normally associated with food availability specie may also travel shorter distance over part of their range with individual from higher latitude travelling into the existing range of conspecific others undertake partial migration where only a fraction of the population usually female and subdominant male migrates partial migration can form a large percentage of the migration behaviour of bird in some region in australia survey found that of bird and of passerine were partially migratoryaltitudinal migration is a form of migration in which bird spend the breeding season at higher altitude and move to lower one during suboptimal condition it is most often triggered by temperature change and usually occurs when the normal territory also become inhospitable due to lack of food some specie may also be nomadic holding no fixed territory and moving according to weather and food availability parrot a a family are overwhelmingly neither migratory nor sedentary but considered to either be dispersive irruptive nomadic or undertake small and irregular migrationsthe ability of bird to return to precise location across vast distance ha been known for some time in an experiment conducted in the a manx shearwater released in boston in the united state returned to it colony in skomer in wale within day a distance of km mi bird navigate during migration using a variety of method for diurnal migrant the sun is used to navigate by day and a stellar compass is used at night bird that use the sun compensate for the changing position of the sun during the day by the use of an internal clock orientation with the stellar compass depends on the position of the constellation surrounding polaris these are backed up in some specie by their ability to sense the earth geomagnetism through specialised photoreceptors communication bird communicate using primarily visual and auditory signal signal can be interspecific between specie and intraspecific within specie bird sometimes use plumage to ass and assert social dominance to display breeding condition in sexually selected specie or to make threatening display a in the sunbittern mimicry of a large predator to ward off hawk and protect young chick variation in plumage also allows for the identification of bird particularly between specie visual communication among bird may also involve ritualised display which have developed from action such a preening the adjustment of feather position pecking or other behaviour these display may signal aggression or submission or may contribute to the formation of the most elaborate display occur during courtship where dance are often formed from complex combination of many possible component movement male breeding success may depend on the quality of such displaysbird call and song which are produced in the syrinx are the major mean by which bird communicate with sound this communication can be very complex some specie can operate the two side of the syrinx independently allowing the simultaneous production of two different song call are used for a variety of purpose including mate attraction evaluation of potential mate bond formation the claiming and maintenance of territory the identification of other individual such a when parent look for chick in colony or when mate reunite at the start of breeding season and the warning of other bird of potential predator sometimes with specific information about the nature of the threat some bird also use mechanical sound for auditory communication the coenocorypha snipe of new zealand drive air through their feather woodpecker drum for communication and palm cockatoo use tool to drum flocking and other association while some bird are essentially territorial or live in small family group other bird may form large flock the principal benefit of flocking are safety in number and increased foraging efficiency defence against predator is particularly important in closed habitat like forest where ambush predation is common and multiple eye can provide a valuable early warning system this ha led to the development of many feeding flock which are usually composed of small number of many specie these flock provide safety in number but increase potential competition for resource cost of flocking include bullying of socially subordinate bird by more dominant bird and the reduction of feeding efficiency in certain casesbirds sometimes also form association with specie seabird associate with dolphin and tuna which push shoaling fish towards the surface hornbill have a mutualistic relationship with dwarf mongoose in which they forage together and warn each other of nearby bird of prey and other predator resting and roosting the high metabolic rate of bird during the active part of the day is supplemented by rest at other time sleeping bird often use a type of sleep known a vigilant sleep where period of rest are interspersed with quick peek allowing them to be sensitive to disturbance and enable rapid escape from threat swift are believed to be able to sleep in flight and radar observation suggest that they orient themselves to face the wind in their roosting flight it ha been suggested that there may be certain kind of sleep which are possible even when in flightsome bird have also demonstrated the capacity to fall into sleep one hemisphere of the brain at a time the bird tend to exercise this ability depending upon it position relative to the outside of the flock this may allow the eye opposite the sleeping hemisphere to remain vigilant for predator by viewing the outer margin of the flock this adaptation is also known from marine mammal communal roosting is common because it lower the loss of body heat and decrease the risk associated with predator roosting site are often chosen with regard to thermoregulation and safetymany sleeping bird bend their head over their back and tuck their bill in their back feather although others place their beak among their breast feather many bird rest on one leg while some may pull up their leg into their feather especially in cold weather perching bird have a tendon locking mechanism that help them hold on to the perch when they are asleep many ground bird such a quail and pheasant roost in tree a few parrot of the genus loriculus roost hanging upside down some hummingbird go into a nightly state of torpor accompanied with a reduction of their metabolic rate this physiological adaptation show in nearly a hundred other specie including nightjar and woodswallows one specie the common poorwill even enters a state of hibernation bird do not have sweat gland but they may cool themselves by moving to shade standing in water panting increasing their surface area fluttering their throat or by using special behaviour like urohidrosis to cool themselves breeding social system per cent of bird specie are socially monogamous these specie pair for at least the length of the breeding season some several year or until the death of one mate monogamy allows for both paternal care and biparental care which is especially important for specie in which female require male assistance for successful among many socially monogamous specie copulation infidelity is common such behaviour typically occurs between dominant male and female paired with subordinate male but may also be the result of forced copulation in duck and other anatidsfor female possible benefit of copulation include getting better gene for her offspring and insuring against the possibility of infertility in her mate male of specie that engage in copulation will closely guard their mate to ensure the parentage of the offspring that they raiseother mating system including polygyny polyandry polygamy polygynandry and promiscuity also occur polygamous breeding system arise when female are able to raise brood without the help of male some specie may use more than one system depending on the circumstance breeding usually involves some form of courtship display typically performed by the male most display are rather simple and involve some type of song some display however are quite elaborate depending on the specie these may include wing or tail drumming dancing aerial flight or communal lekking female are generally the one that drive partner selection although in the polyandrous phalarope this is reversed plainer male choose brightly coloured female courtship feeding billing and allopreening are commonly performed between partner generally after the bird have paired and matedhomosexual behaviour ha been observed in male or female in numerous specie of bird including copulation and joint parenting of chick over avian specie around the world engage in sexual interaction between the same sex or homosexual behavior courtship activity may involve elaborate display synchronized dance ceremony or behavior at specific display area including bower arena or lek territory nesting and incubation many bird actively defend a territory from others of the same specie during the breeding season maintenance of territory protects the food source for their chick specie that are unable to defend feeding territory such a seabird and swift often breed in colony instead this is thought to offer protection from predator colonial breeder defend small nesting site and competition between and within specie for nesting site can be intenseall bird lay amniotic egg with hard shell made mostly of calcium carbonate hole and burrow nesting specie tend to lay white or pale egg while open nester lay camouflaged egg there are many exception to this pattern however the nightjar have pale egg and camouflage is instead provided by their plumage specie that are victim of brood parasite have varying egg colour to improve the chance of spotting a parasite egg which force female parasite to match their egg to those of their host bird egg are usually laid in a nest most specie create somewhat elaborate nest which can be cup dome plate bed scrape mound or burrow some bird nest however are extremely primitive albatross nest are no more than a scrape on the ground most bird build nest in sheltered hidden area to avoid predation but large or colonial are more capable of build more open nest during nest construction some specie seek out plant matter from plant with toxin to improve chick survival and feather are often used for nest insulation some bird specie have no nest the common guillemot lay it egg on bare rock and male emperor penguin keep egg between their body and foot the absence of nest is especially prevalent in specie where the newly hatched young are precocial incubation which optimises temperature for chick development usually begin after the last egg ha been laid in monogamous specie incubation duty are often shared whereas in polygamous specie one parent is wholly responsible for incubation warmth from parent pass to the egg through brood patch area of bare skin on the abdomen or breast of the incubating bird incubation can be an energetically demanding process adult albatross for instance lose a much a gram oz of body weight per day of incubation the warmth for the incubation of the egg of megapode come from the sun decaying vegetation or volcanic source incubation period range from day in woodpecker cuckoo and passerine bird to over day in albatross and kiwi the diversity of characteristic of bird is great sometimes even in closely related specie several avian characteristic are compared in the table below parental care and fledging at the time of their hatching chick range in development from helpless to independent depending on their specie helpless chick are termed altricial and tend to be born small blind immobile and naked chick that are mobile and feathered upon hatching are termed precocial altricial chick need help thermoregulating and must be brooded for longer than precocial chick the young of many bird specie do not precisely fit into either the precocial or altricial category having some aspect of each and thus fall somewhere on an spectrum chick at neither extreme but favoring one or the other may be termed or the length and nature of parental care varies widely amongst different order and specie at one extreme parental care in megapode end at hatching the newly hatched chick dig itself out of the nest mound without parental assistance and can fend for itself immediately at the other extreme many seabird have extended period of parental care the longest being that of the great frigatebird whose chick take up to six month to fledge and are fed by the parent for up to an additional month the chick guard stage describes the period of breeding during which one of the adult bird is permanently present at the nest after chick have hatched the main purpose of the guard stage is to aid offspring to thermoregulate and protect them from predationin some specie both parent care for nestling and fledgling in others such care is the responsibility of only one sex in some specie other member of the same close relative of the breeding pair such a offspring from previous help with the raising of the young such alloparenting is particularly common among the corvida which includes such bird a the true crow australian magpie and but ha been observed in specie a different a the rifleman and red kite among most group of animal male parental care is rare in bird however it is quite so than in any other vertebrate class although territory and nest site defence incubation and chick feeding are often shared task there is sometimes a division of labour in which one mate undertakes all or most of a particular dutythe point at which chick fledge varies dramatically the chick of the synthliboramphus murrelets like the ancient murrelet leave the nest the night after they hatch following their parent out to sea where they are raised away from terrestrial predator some other specie such a duck move their chick away from the nest at an early age in most specie chick leave the nest just before or soon after they are able to fly the amount of parental care after fledging varies albatross chick leave the nest on their own and receive no further help while other specie continue some supplementary feeding after fledging chick may also follow their parent during their first migration brood parasite brood parasitism in which an leaf her egg with another individual brood is more common among bird than any other type of organism after a parasitic bird lay her egg in another bird nest they are often accepted and raised by the host at the expense of the host own brood brood parasite may be either obligate brood parasite which must lay their egg in the nest of other specie because they are incapable of raising their own young or brood parasite which sometimes lay egg in the nest of conspecific to increase their reproductive output even though they could have raised their own young one hundred bird specie including honeyguides icterids and duck are obligate parasite though the most famous are the cuckoo some brood parasite are adapted to hatch before their host young which allows them to destroy the host egg by pushing them out of the nest or to kill the host chick this ensures that all food brought to the nest will be fed to the parasitic chick sexual selection bird have evolved a variety of mating behaviour with the peacock tail being perhaps the most famous example of sexual selection and the fisherian runaway commonly occurring sexual dimorphism such a size and colour difference are energetically costly attribute that signal competitive breeding situation many type of avian sexual selection have been identified intersexual selection also known a female choice and intrasexual competition where individual of the more abundant sex compete with each other for the privilege to mate sexually selected trait often evolve to become more pronounced in competitive breeding situation until the trait begin to limit the individual fitness conflict between an individual fitness and signalling adaptation ensure that sexually selected ornament such a plumage coloration and courtship behaviour are honest trait signal must be costly to ensure that only individual can present these exaggerated sexual ornament and behaviour inbreeding depression inbreeding cause early death inbreeding depression in the zebra finch taeniopygia guttata embryo survival that is hatching success of fertile egg wa significantly lower for mating pair than for unrelated pair darwin finch geospiza scandens experience inbreeding depression reduced survival of offspring and the magnitude of this effect is influenced by environmental condition such a low food availability inbreeding avoidance incestuous mating by the fairy wren malurus coronatus result in severe fitness cost due to inbreeding depression greater than reduction in hatchability of egg female paired with related male may undertake extra pair mating see promiscuity other animal for frequency in avian specie that can reduce the negative effect of inbreeding however there are ecological and demographic constraint on extra pair mating nevertheless of brood produced by incestuously paired female contained extra pair younginbreeding depression occurs in the great tit parus major when the offspring produced a a result of a mating between close relative show reduced fitness in natural population of parus major inbreeding is avoided by dispersal of individual from their birthplace which reduces the chance of mating with a close relativesouthern pied babbler turdoides bicolor appear to avoid inbreeding in two way the first is through dispersal and the second is by avoiding familiar group member a mate although both male and female disperse locally they move outside the range where genetically related individual are likely to be encountered within their group individual only acquire breeding position when the breeder is unrelated cooperative breeding in bird typically occurs when offspring usually male delay dispersal from their natal group in order to remain with the family to help rear younger kin female offspring rarely stay at home dispersing over distance that allow them to breed independently or to join unrelated group in general inbreeding is avoided because it lead to a reduction in progeny fitness inbreeding depression due largely to the homozygous expression of deleterious recessive allele between unrelated individual ordinarily lead to the masking of deleterious recessive allele in progeny ecology bird occupy a wide range of ecological position while some bird are generalist others are highly specialised in their habitat or food requirement even within a single habitat such a a forest the niche occupied by different specie of bird vary with some specie feeding in the forest canopy others beneath the canopy and still others on the forest floor forest bird may be insectivore frugivores and nectarivores aquatic bird generally feed by fishing plant eating and piracy or kleptoparasitism bird of prey specialise in hunting mammal or other bird while vulture are specialised scavenger avivores are animal that are specialised at preying on bird some bird are important pollinator and many frugivores play a key role in seed dispersal plant and pollinating bird often coevolve and in some case a flower primary pollinator is the only specie capable of reaching it nectarbirds are often important to island ecology bird have frequently reached island that mammal have not on those island bird may fulfil ecological role typically played by larger animal for example in new zealand nine specie of moa were important browser a are the kereru and kokako today today the plant of new zealand retain the defensive adaptation evolved to protect them from the extinct moa nesting seabird may also affect the ecology of island and surrounding sea principally through the concentration of large quantity of guano which may enrich the local soil and the surrounding seasa wide variety of avian ecology field method including count nest monitoring and capturing and marking are used for researching avian ecology relationship with human since bird are highly visible and common animal human have had a relationship with them since the dawn of man sometimes these relationship are mutualistic like the cooperative among honeyguides and african people such a the borana other time they may be commensal a when specie such a the house sparrow have benefited from human activity several bird specie have become commercially significant agricultural pest and some pose an aviation hazard human activity can also be detrimental and have threatened numerous bird specie with extinction hunting avian lead poisoning pesticide roadkill wind turbine kill and predation by pet cat and dog are common cause of death for bird bird can act a vector for spreading disease such a psittacosis salmonellosis campylobacteriosis mycobacteriosis avian tuberculosis avian influenza bird flu giardiasis and cryptosporidiosis over long distance some of these are zoonotic disease that can also be transmitted to human economic importance domesticated bird raised for meat and egg called poultry are the largest source of animal protein eaten by human in million ton of poultry and million ton of egg were produced worldwide chicken account for much of human poultry consumption though domesticated turkey duck and goose are also relatively common many specie of bird are also hunted for meat bird hunting is primarily a recreational activity except in extremely undeveloped area the most important bird hunted in north and south america are waterfowl other widely hunted bird include pheasant wild turkey quail dove partridge grouse snipe and woodcock muttonbirding is also popular in australia and new zealand although some hunting such a that of muttonbirds may be sustainable hunting ha led to the extinction or endangerment of dozen of speciesother commercially valuable product from bird include feather especially the down of goose and duck which are used a insulation in clothing and bedding and seabird faeces guano which is a valuable source of phosphorus and nitrogen the war of the pacific sometimes called the guano war wa fought in part over the control of guano depositsbirds have been domesticated by human both a pet and for practical purpose colourful bird such a parrot and myna are bred in captivity or kept a pet a practice that ha led to the illegal trafficking of some endangered specie falcon and cormorant have long been used for hunting and fishing respectively messenger pigeon used since at least ad remained important a recently a world war ii today such activity are more common either a hobby for entertainment and tourism or for sport such a pigeon racing amateur bird enthusiast called birdwatchers twitchers or more commonly birder number in the million many homeowner erect bird feeder near their home to attract various specie bird feeding ha grown into a industry for example an estimated of household in britain provide food for bird at some point during the winter in religion and mythology bird play prominent and diverse role in religion and mythology in religion bird may serve a either messenger or priest and leader for a deity such a in the cult of makemake in which the tangata manu of easter island served a chief or a attendant a in the case of hugin and munin the two common raven who whispered news into the ear of the norse god odin in several civilisation of ancient italy particularly etruscan and roman religion priest were involved in augury or interpreting the word of bird while the auspex from which the word auspicious is derived watched their activity to foretell eventsthey may also serve a religious symbol a when jonah hebrew dove embodied the fright passivity mourning and beauty traditionally associated with dove bird have themselves been deified a in the case of the common peacock which is perceived a mother earth by the dravidian of india in the ancient world dove were used a symbol of the mesopotamian goddess inanna later known a ishtar the canaanite mother goddess asherah and the greek goddess aphrodite in ancient greece athena the goddess of wisdom and patron deity of the city of athens had a little owl a her symbol in religious image preserved from the inca and tiwanaku empire bird are depicted in the process of transgressing boundary between earthly and underground spiritual realm indigenous people of the central andes maintain legend of bird passing to and from metaphysical world in culture and folklore bird have featured in culture and art since prehistoric time when they were represented in early cave painting some bird have been perceived a monster including the mythological roc and the maori legendary pouakai a giant bird capable of snatching human bird were later used a symbol of power a in the magnificent peacock throne of the mughal and persian emperor with the advent of scientific interest in bird many painting of bird were commissioned for book among the most famous of these bird artist wa john james audubon whose painting of north american bird were a great commercial success in europe and who later lent his name to the national audubon society bird are also important figure in poetry for example homer incorporated nightingale into his odyssey and catullus used a sparrow a an erotic symbol in his catullus the relationship between an albatross and a sailor is the central theme of samuel taylor coleridge the rime of the ancient mariner which led to the use of the term a a metaphor for a other english metaphor derive from bird vulture fund and vulture investor for instance take their name from the scavenging vultureperceptions of bird specie vary across culture owl are associated with bad luck witchcraft and death in part of africa but are regarded a wise across much of europe hoopoe were considered sacred in ancient egypt and symbol of virtue in persia but were thought of a thief across much of europe and harbinger of war in scandinavia in heraldry bird especially eagle often appear in coat of arm in music in music birdsong ha influenced composer and musician in several way they can be inspired by birdsong they can intentionally imitate bird song in a composition a vivaldi messiaen and beethoven did along with many later composer they can incorporate recording of bird into their work a ottorino respighi first did or like beatrice harrison and david rothenberg they can duet with bird conservation although human activity have allowed the expansion of a few specie such a the barn swallow and european starling they have caused population decrease or extinction in many other specie over a hundred bird specie have gone extinct in historical time although the most dramatic avian extinction eradicating an estimated specie occurred during the human colonisation of melanesian polynesian and micronesian island many bird population are declining worldwide with specie listed a threatened by birdlife international and the iucn in most commonly cited human threat to bird is habitat loss other threat include overhunting accidental mortality due to collision with building or vehicle fishing bycatch pollution including oil spill and pesticide use competition and predation from nonnative invasive specie and climate change government and conservation group work to protect bird either by passing law that preserve and restore bird habitat or by establishing captive population for reintroduction such project have produced some success one study estimated that conservation effort saved specie of bird that would otherwise have gone extinct between and including the california condor and norfolk parakeet see also animal track avian sleep bat glossary of
