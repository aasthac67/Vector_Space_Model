dinosaur are a diverse group of reptile of the clade dinosauria they first appeared during the triassic period between and million year ago although the exact origin and timing of the evolution of dinosaur is the subject of active research they became the dominant terrestrial vertebrate after the extinction event million year ago their dominance continued throughout the jurassic and cretaceous period the fossil record demonstrates that bird are modern feathered dinosaur having evolved from earlier theropod during the late jurassic epoch a such bird were the only dinosaur lineage to survive the extinction event approximately million year ago dinosaur can therefore be divided into avian dinosaur or bird and dinosaur which are all dinosaur other than bird dinosaur are a varied group of animal from taxonomic morphological and ecological standpoint bird at over living specie are the most diverse group of vertebrate besides perciform fish using fossil evidence paleontologist have identified over distinct genus and more than different specie of dinosaur dinosaur are represented on every continent by both extant specie bird and fossil remains through the first half of the century before bird were recognized to be dinosaur most of the scientific community believed dinosaur to have been sluggish and most research conducted since the however ha indicated that all dinosaur were active animal with elevated metabolism and numerous adaptation for social interaction some were herbivorous others carnivorous evidence suggests that all dinosaur were and that wa a trait shared by many dinosaur both avian and while dinosaur were ancestrally bipedal many extinct group included quadrupedal specie and some were able to shift between these stance elaborate display structure such a horn or crest are common to all dinosaur group and some extinct group developed skeletal modification such a bony armor and spine while the dinosaur surviving avian lineage bird are generally small due to the constraint of flight many prehistoric dinosaur and avian were largest sauropod dinosaur are estimated to have reached length of meter foot and height of m ft and were the largest land animal of all time still the idea that dinosaur were uniformly gigantic is a misconception based in part on preservation bias a large sturdy bone are more likely to last until they are fossilized many dinosaur were quite small xixianykus for example wa only about centimeter inch long since the first dinosaur fossil were recognized in the early century mounted fossil dinosaur skeleton have been major attraction at museum around the world and dinosaur have become an enduring part of world culture the large size of some dinosaur group a well a their seemingly monstrous and fantastic nature have ensured dinosaur regular appearance in book and film such a jurassic park persistent public enthusiasm for the animal ha resulted in significant funding for dinosaur science and new discovery are regularly covered by the medium etymology the taxon wa formally named in by paleontologist sir richard owen who used it to refer to the distinct tribe or of saurian reptile that were then being recognized in england and around the world the term is derived from ancient greek deinos deinos meaning potent or fearfully great and sauros sauros meaning or reptile though the taxonomic name ha often been interpreted a a reference to dinosaur teeth claw and other fearsome characteristic owen intended it merely to evoke their size and majestyother prehistoric animal including pterosaur mosasaurs ichthyosaur plesiosaur and dimetrodon while often popularly conceived of a dinosaur are not taxonomically classified a dinosaur pterosaur are distantly related to dinosaur being member of the clade ornithodira the other group mentioned are like dinosaur and pterosaur member of sauropsida the reptile and bird clade except dimetrodon which is a synapsid definition under phylogenetic nomenclature dinosaur are usually defined a the group consisting of the most recent common ancestor mrca of triceratops and modern bird neornithes and all it descendant it ha also been suggested that dinosauria be defined with respect to the mrca of megalosaurus and iguanodon because these were two of the three genus cited by richard owen when he recognized the dinosauria both definition result in the same set of animal being defined a dinosaur dinosauria ornithischia saurischia encompassing ankylosaurians armored herbivorous quadruped stegosaurians plated herbivorous quadruped ceratopsian herbivorous quadruped with horn and frill ornithopod bipedal or quadrupedal herbivore including theropod mostly bipedal carnivore and bird and sauropodomorphs mostly large herbivorous quadruped with long neck and tail bird are now recognized a being the sole surviving lineage of theropod dinosaur in traditional taxonomy bird were considered a separate class that had evolved from dinosaur a distinct superorder however a majority of contemporary paleontologist concerned with dinosaur reject the traditional style of classification in favor of phylogenetic taxonomy this approach requires that for a group to be natural all descendant of member of the group must be included in the group a well bird are thus considered to be dinosaur and dinosaur are therefore not extinct bird are classified a belonging to the subgroup maniraptora which are coelurosaurs which are theropod which are saurischian which are dinosaursresearch by matthew g baron david b norman and paul m barrett in suggested a radical revision of dinosaurian systematics phylogenetic analysis by baron et al recovered the ornithischia a being closer to the theropoda than the sauropodomorpha a opposed to the traditional union of theropod with sauropodomorphs they resurrected the clade ornithoscelida to refer to the group containing ornithischia and theropoda dinosauria itself wa a the last common ancestor of triceratops horridus passer domesticus and diplodocus carnegii and all of it descendant to ensure that sauropod and kin remain included a dinosaur general description using one of the above definition dinosaur can be generally described a archosaur with hind limb held erect beneath the body many prehistoric animal group are popularly conceived of a dinosaur such a ichthyosaur mosasaurs plesiosaur pterosaur and pelycosaur especially dimetrodon but are not classified scientifically a dinosaur and none had the erect hind limb posture characteristic of true dinosaur dinosaur were the dominant terrestrial vertebrate of the mesozoic era especially the jurassic and cretaceous period other group of animal were restricted in size and niche mammal for example rarely exceeded the size of a domestic cat and were generally carnivore of small preydinosaurs have always been an extremely varied group of animal according to a study over dinosaur genus have been identified with certainty so far and the total number of genus preserved in the fossil record ha been estimated at around nearly of which remain to be discovered an earlier study predicted that about dinosaur genus existed including many that would not have been preserved in the fossil record by september different specie of dinosaur had been namedin the estimated number of dinosaur specie that existed in the mesozoic wa estimated to be some are herbivorous others carnivorous including insectivore and omnivore while dinosaur were ancestrally bipedal a are all modern bird some prehistoric specie were quadruped and others such a anchisaurus and iguanodon could walk just a easily on two or four leg cranial modification like horn and crest are common dinosaurian trait and some extinct specie had bony armor although known for large size many mesozoic dinosaur were or smaller and modern bird are generally small in size dinosaur today inhabit every continent and fossil show that they had achieved global distribution by at least the early jurassic epoch modern bird inhabit most available habitat from terrestrial to marine and there is evidence that some dinosaur such a microraptor could fly or at least glide and others such a spinosaurids had semiaquatic habit distinguishing anatomical feature while recent discovery have made it more difficult to present a universally list of dinosaur distinguishing feature nearly all dinosaur discovered so far share certain modification to the ancestral archosaurian skeleton or are clear descendant of older dinosaur showing these modification although some later group of dinosaur featured further modified version of these trait they are considered typical for dinosauria the earliest dinosaur had them and passed them on to their descendant such modification originating in the most recent common ancestor of a certain taxonomic group are called the synapomorphies of such a groupa detailed assessment of archosaur interrelation by sterling nesbitt confirmed or found the following twelve unambiguous synapomorphies some previously known in the skull a supratemporal fossa excavation is present in front of the supratemporal fenestra the main opening in the rear skull roof epipophyses obliquely process on the rear top corner present in the anterior front neck vertebra behind the atlas and axis the first two neck vertebra apex of a deltopectoral crest a projection on which the deltopectoral muscle attach located at or more than down the length of the humerus upper arm bone radius a lower arm bone shorter than of humerus length fourth trochanter projection where the caudofemoralis muscle attache on the inner rear shaft on the femur thigh bone is a sharp flange fourth trochanter asymmetrical with distal lower margin forming a steeper angle to the shaft on the astragalus and calcaneum upper ankle bone the proximal articular facet the top connecting surface for the fibula occupies le than of the transverse width of the element exoccipitals bone at the back of the skull do not meet along the midline on the floor of the endocranial cavity the inner space of the braincase in the pelvis the proximal articular surface of the ischium with the ilium and the pubis are separated by a large concave surface on the upper side of the ischium a part of the open hip joint is located between the contact with the pubic bone and the ilium cnemial crest on the tibia protruding part of the top surface of the shinbone arc anterolaterally curve to the front and the outer side distinct proximodistally oriented vertical ridge present on the posterior face of the distal end of the tibia the rear surface of the lower end of the shinbone concave articular surface for the fibula of the calcaneum the top surface of the calcaneum where it touch the fibula ha a hollow profile nesbitt found a number of further potential synapomorphies and discounted a number of synapomorphies previously suggested some of these are also present in silesaurids which nesbitt recovered a a sister group to dinosauria including a large anterior trochanter metatarsal ii and iv of subequal length reduced contact between ischium and pubis the presence of a cnemial crest on the tibia and of an ascending process on the astragalus and many others a variety of other skeletal feature are shared by dinosaur however because they are either common to other group of archosaur or were not present in all early dinosaur these feature are not considered to be synapomorphies for example a diapsid dinosaur ancestrally had two pair of infratemporal fenestra opening in the skull behind the eye and a member of the diapsid group archosauria had additional opening in the snout and lower jaw additionally several characteristic once thought to be synapomorphies are now known to have appeared before dinosaur or were absent in the earliest dinosaur and independently evolved by different dinosaur group these include an elongated scapula or shoulder blade a sacrum composed of three or more fused vertebra three are found in some other archosaur but only two are found in herrerasaurus and a perforate acetabulum or hip socket with a hole at the center of it inside surface closed in saturnalia tupiniquim for example another difficulty of determining distinctly dinosaurian feature is that early dinosaur and other archosaur from the late triassic epoch are often poorly known and were similar in many way these animal have sometimes been misidentified in the literature dinosaur stand with their hind limb erect in a manner similar to most modern mammal but distinct from most other reptile whose limb sprawl out to either side this posture is due to the development of a laterally facing recess in the pelvis usually an open socket and a corresponding inwardly facing distinct head on the femur their erect posture enabled early dinosaur to breathe easily while moving which likely permitted stamen and activity level that surpassed those of sprawling reptile erect limb probably also helped support the evolution of large size by reducing bending stress on limb some archosaur including rauisuchians also had erect limb but achieved this by a configuration of the hip joint where instead of having a projection from the femur insert on a socket on the hip the upper pelvic bone wa rotated to form an overhanging shelf evolutionary history origin and early evolution dinosaur diverged from their archosaur ancestor during the middle to late triassic epoch roughly million year after the devastating extinction event wiped out an estimated of all marine specie and of terrestrial vertebrate specie approximately million year ago radiometric dating of the rock formation that contained fossil from the early dinosaur genus eoraptor at million year old establishes it presence in the fossil record at this time paleontologist think that eoraptor resembles the common ancestor of all dinosaur if this is true it trait suggest that the first dinosaur were small bipedal predator the discovery of primitive ornithodirans such a marasuchus and lagerpeton in argentinian middle triassic stratum support this view analysis of recovered fossil suggests that these animal were indeed small bipedal predator dinosaur may have appeared a early a million year ago a evidenced by remains of the genus nyasasaurus from that period though known fossil of these animal are too fragmentary to tell if they are dinosaur or very close dinosaurian relative paleontologist max c langer et al determined that staurikosaurus from the santa maria formation date to million year ago making it older in geologic age than eoraptorwhen dinosaur appeared they were not the dominant terrestrial animal the terrestrial habitat were occupied by various type of archosauromorphs and therapsid like cynodont and rhynchosaurs their main competitor were the pseudosuchia such a aetosaurs ornithosuchids and rauisuchians which were more successful than the dinosaur most of these other animal became extinct in the triassic in one of two event first at about million year ago a variety of basal archosauromorphs including the protorosaurs became extinct this wa followed by the extinction event about million year ago that saw the end of most of the other group of early archosaur like aetosaurs ornithosuchids phytosaurs and rauisuchians rhynchosaurs and dicynodont survived at least in some area at least a late a norian and late norian or earliest rhaetian stage respectively and the exact date of their extinction is uncertain these loss left behind a land fauna of crocodylomorphs dinosaur mammal pterosaurians and turtle the first few line of early dinosaur diversified through the carnian and norian stage of the triassic possibly by occupying the niche of the group that became extinct also notably there wa a heightened rate of extinction during the carnian pluvial event evolution and paleobiogeography dinosaur evolution after the triassic follows change in vegetation and the location of continent in the late triassic and early jurassic the continent were connected a the single landmass pangaea and there were a worldwide dinosaur fauna mostly composed of coelophysoid carnivore and early sauropodomorph herbivore gymnosperm plant particularly conifer a potential food source radiated in the late triassic early sauropodomorphs did not have sophisticated mechanism for processing food in the mouth and so must have employed other mean of breaking down food farther along the digestive tract the general homogeneity of dinosaurian fauna continued into the middle and late jurassic where most locality had predator consisting of ceratosaurians spinosauroids and carnosaurians and herbivore consisting of stegosaurian ornithischian and large sauropod example of this include the morrison formation of north america and tendaguru bed of tanzania dinosaur in china show some difference with specialized sinraptorid theropod and unusual sauropod like mamenchisaurus ankylosaurians and ornithopod were also becoming more common but prosauropods had become extinct conifer and pteridophyte were the most common plant sauropod like the earlier prosauropods were not oral processor but ornithischian were evolving various mean of dealing with food in the mouth including potential organ to keep food in the mouth and jaw motion to grind food another notable evolutionary event of the jurassic wa the appearance of true bird descended from maniraptoran coelurosaurians by the early cretaceous and the ongoing breakup of pangaea dinosaur were becoming strongly differentiated by landmass the earliest part of this time saw the spread of ankylosaurians iguanodontians and brachiosaurids through europe north america and northern africa these were later supplemented or replaced in africa by large spinosaurid and carcharodontosaurid theropod and rebbachisaurid and titanosaurian sauropod also found in south america in asia maniraptoran coelurosaurians like dromaeosaurids troodontids and oviraptorosaurians became the common theropod and ankylosaurids and early ceratopsian like psittacosaurus became important herbivore meanwhile australia wa home to a fauna of basal ankylosaurians hypsilophodonts and iguanodontians the stegosaurians appear to have gone extinct at some point in the late early cretaceous or early late cretaceous a major change in the early cretaceous which would be amplified in the late cretaceous wa the evolution of flowering plant at the same time several group of dinosaurian herbivore evolved more sophisticated way to orally process food ceratopsian developed a method of slicing with teeth stacked on each other in battery and iguanodontians refined a method of grinding with dental battery taken to it extreme in hadrosaurids some sauropod also evolved tooth battery best exemplified by the rebbachisaurid nigersaurus there were three general dinosaur fauna in the late cretaceous in the northern continent of north america and asia the major theropod were tyrannosaurids and various type of smaller maniraptoran theropod with a predominantly ornithischian herbivore assemblage of hadrosaurids ceratopsian ankylosaurids and pachycephalosaurians in the southern continent that had made up the gondwana abelisaurids were the common theropod and titanosaurian sauropod the common herbivore finally in europe dromaeosaurids rhabdodontid iguanodontians nodosaurid ankylosaurians and titanosaurian sauropod were prevalent flowering plant were greatly radiating with the first grass appearing by the end of the cretaceous grinding hadrosaurids and shearing ceratopsian became extremely diverse across north america and asia theropod were also radiating a herbivore or omnivore with therizinosaurians and ornithomimosaurians becoming commonthe extinction event which occurred approximately million year ago at the end of the cretaceous caused the extinction of all dinosaur group except for the neornithine bird some other diapsid group such a crocodilian sebecosuchians turtle lizard snake sphenodontians and choristoderans also survived the eventthe surviving lineage of neornithine bird including the ancestor of modern ratite duck and chicken and a variety of waterbird diversified rapidly at the beginning of the paleogene period entering ecological niche left vacant by the extinction of mesozoic dinosaur group such a the arboreal enantiornithines aquatic hesperornithines and even the larger terrestrial theropod in the form of gastornis eogruiids bathornithids ratite geranoidids mihirungs and terror bird it is often cited that mammal the neornithines for dominance of most terrestrial niche but many of these group with rich mammalian fauna for most of the cenozoic era terror bird and bathornithids occupied carnivorous guild alongside predatory mammal and ratite are still fairly successful a herbivore eogruiids similarly lasted from the eocene to pliocene only becoming extinct very recently after over million year of with many mammal group classification dinosaur belong to a group known a archosaur which also includes modern crocodilian within the archosaur group dinosaur are differentiated most noticeably by their gait dinosaur leg extend directly beneath the body whereas the leg of lizard and crocodilian sprawl out to either sidecollectively dinosaur a a clade are divided into two primary branch saurischia and ornithischia saurischia includes those taxon sharing a more recent common ancestor with bird than with ornithischia while ornithischia includes all taxon sharing a more recent common ancestor with triceratops than with saurischia anatomically these two group can be distinguished most noticeably by their pelvic structure early from the greek sauros sauros meaning lizard and ischion iskhion meaning hip joint the hip structure of their ancestor with a pubis bone directed cranially or forward this basic form wa modified by rotating the pubis backward to varying degree in several group herrerasaurus therizinosauroids dromaeosaurids and bird saurischia includes the theropod exclusively bipedal and with a wide variety of diet and sauropodomorphs herbivore which include advanced quadrupedal group by contrast from the greek ornitheios ornitheios meaning of a bird and ischion iskhion meaning hip joint a pelvis that superficially resembled a bird pelvis the pubic bone wa oriented caudally unlike bird the ornithischian pubis also usually had an additional process ornithischia includes a variety of specie that were primarily herbivore nb the term lizard hip and bird hip are misnomer bird evolved from dinosaur with lizard hip taxonomy the following is a simplified classification of dinosaur group based on their evolutionary relationship and organized based on the list of mesozoic dinosaur specie provided by holtz a more detailed version can be found at dinosaur classification the dagger is used to signify group with no living member dinosauriasaurischia includes theropoda and sauropodomorpha early bipedal carnivore theropoda all bipedal most were carnivorous small early theropod includes coelophysis and close relative early crested and carnivorous theropod generally elaborately horned the dominant southern carnivore of the cretaceous tetanurae stiff tail includes most theropod early group of large carnivore including the semiaquatic spinosaurids allosaurus and close relative like carcharodontosaurus coelurosauria feathered theropod with a range of body size and niche common early coelurosaurs with reduced forelimb tyrannosaurus and close relative had reduced forelimb mostly toothless carnivore to possible herbivore small insectivore with reduced forelimb each bearing one enlarged claw maniraptora hand snatcher had long slender arm and finger bipedal herbivore with large hand claw and small head mostly toothless their diet and lifestyle are uncertain small winged theropod or primitive bird to with a distinctive toe claw avialae modern bird and extinct relative small primitive avialans with long third finger large early avialans small toothless avialans primitive flying avialans euornithes advanced flying bird toothed cretaceous chinese bird specialized aquatic diving bird aves modern beaked bird and their extinct relative herbivore with small head long neck long tail small primitive omnivorous sauropodomorphs primitive strictly bipedal prosauropods small primitive sauropodomorphs small primitive sauropodomorphs very large and heavy usually over m ft long quadrupedal primitive sauropod with limb true sauropod whale reptile european group of jurassic and cretaceous sauropod new sauropod skull and tail elongated teeth typically narrow and boxy skull or teeth macronarians diverse stocky with wide hip most common in the late cretaceous of southern continent diverse bipedal and quadrupedal herbivore small basal ornithopod with prominent teeth armored dinosaur mostly quadruped scute a primary armor some had tail spike and plate a primary armor new ornithischian various size biped and quadruped evolved a method of chewing using skull flexibility and numerous teeth characterized by a cranial growth biped with domed or knobby growth on skull quadruped with frill many also had horn biology knowledge about dinosaur is derived from a variety of fossil and record including fossilized bone feces trackways gastroliths feather impression of skin internal organ and soft tissue many field of study contribute to our understanding of dinosaur including physic especially biomechanics chemistry biology and the earth science of which paleontology is a two topic of particular interest and study have been dinosaur size and behavior size current evidence suggests that dinosaur average size varied through the triassic early jurassic late jurassic and cretaceous predatory theropod dinosaur which occupied most terrestrial carnivore niche during the mesozoic most often fall into the to kg to lb category when sorted by estimated weight into category based on order of magnitude whereas recent predatory carnivoran mammal peak in the to kg to lb category the mode of mesozoic dinosaur body mass is between to metric ton to short ton this contrast sharply with the average size of cenozoic mammal estimated by the national museum of natural history a about to kg to lb the sauropod were the largest and heaviest dinosaur for much of the dinosaur era the smallest sauropod were larger than anything else in their habitat and the largest wa an order of magnitude more massive than anything else that ha since walked the earth giant prehistoric mammal such a paraceratherium the largest land mammal ever were dwarfed by the giant sauropod and only modern whale approach or surpass them in size there are several proposed advantage for the large size of sauropod including protection from predation reduction of energy use and longevity but it may be that the most important advantage wa dietary large animal are more efficient at digestion than small animal because food spends more time in their digestive system this also permit them to subsist on food with lower nutritive value than smaller animal sauropod remains are mostly found in rock formation interpreted a dry or seasonally dry and the ability to eat large quantity of browse would have been advantageous in such environment largest and smallest scientist will probably never be certain of the largest and smallest dinosaur to have ever existed this is because only a tiny percentage of animal were ever fossilized and most of these remain buried in the earth few of the specimen that are recovered are complete skeleton and impression of skin and other soft tissue are rare rebuilding a complete skeleton by comparing the size and morphology of bone to those of similar specie is an inexact art and reconstructing the muscle and other organ of the living animal is at best a process of educated guessworkthe tallest and heaviest dinosaur known from good skeleton is giraffatitan brancai previously classified a a specie of brachiosaurus it remains were discovered in tanzania between and bone from several individual were incorporated into the skeleton now mounted and on display at the museum fur naturkunde in berlin this mount is meter ft tall and to meter to ft long and would have belonged to an animal that weighed between and kilogram and lb the longest complete dinosaur is the meter ft long diplodocus which wa discovered in wyoming in the united state and displayed in pittsburgh carnegie museum of natural history in the longest dinosaur known from good fossil material is the patagotitan the skeleton mount in the american museum of natural history in new york is meter ft long the museo municipal carmen funes in plaza huincul argentina ha an argentinosaurus reconstructed skeleton mount meter ft long there were larger dinosaur but knowledge of them is based entirely on a small number of fragmentary fossil most of the largest herbivorous specimen on record were discovered in the or later and include the massive argentinosaurus which may have weighed to kilogram to short ton and reached length of to meter to ft some of the longest were the meter ft long diplodocus hallorum formerly seismosaurus the to meter to ft long supersaurus and meter ft long patagotitan and the tallest the meter ft tall sauroposeidon which could have reached a window the heaviest and longest dinosaur may have been maraapunisaurus known only from a now lost partial vertebral neural arch described in extrapolating from the illustration of this bone the animal may have been meter ft long and weighed kg lb however a no further evidence of sauropod of this size ha been found and the discoverer edward drinker cope had made typographic error before it is likely to have been an extreme overestimationthe largest carnivorous dinosaur wa spinosaurus reaching a length of to meter to ft and weighing to metric ton to short ton other large carnivorous theropod included giganotosaurus carcharodontosaurus and tyrannosaurus therizinosaurus and deinocheirus were among the tallest of the theropod the largest ornithischian dinosaur wa probably the hadrosaurid shantungosaurus giganteus which measured meter ft the largest individual may have weighed a much a metric ton short ton the smallest dinosaur known is the bee hummingbird with a length of only centimeter in and mass of around g oz the smallest known dinosaur were about the size of pigeon and were those theropod most closely related to bird for example anchiornis huxleyi is currently the smallest dinosaur described from an adult specimen with an estimated weight of g oz and a total skeletal length of centimeter ft the smallest herbivorous dinosaur included microceratus and wannanosaurus at about centimeter ft long each behavior many modern bird are highly social often found living in flock there is general agreement that some behavior that are common in bird a well a in crocodile bird closest living relative were also common among extinct dinosaur group interpretation of behavior in fossil specie are generally based on the pose of skeleton and their habitat computer simulation of their biomechanics and comparison with modern animal in similar ecological nichesthe first potential evidence for herding or flocking a a widespread behavior common to many dinosaur group in addition to bird wa the discovery of iguanodon bernissartensis ornithischian that were then thought to have perished together in bernissart belgium after they fell into a deep flooded sinkhole and drowned other site have been discovered subsequently those along with multiple trackways suggest that gregarious behavior wa common in many early dinosaur specie trackways of hundred or even thousand of herbivore indicate that hadrosaurids may have moved in great herd like the american bison or the african springbok sauropod track document that these animal traveled in group composed of several different specie at least in oxfordshire england although there is no evidence for specific herd structure congregating into herd may have evolved for defense for migratory purpose or to provide protection for young there is evidence that many type of dinosaur including various theropod sauropod ankylosaurians ornithopod and ceratopsian formed aggregation of immature individual one example is a site in inner mongolia that ha yielded the remains of over sinornithomimus from one to seven year old this assemblage is interpreted a a social group that wa trapped in mud the interpretation of dinosaur a gregarious ha also extended to depicting carnivorous theropod a pack hunter working together to bring down large prey however this lifestyle is uncommon among modern bird crocodile and other reptile and the taphonomic evidence suggesting pack hunting in such theropod a deinonychus and allosaurus can also be interpreted a the result of fatal dispute between feeding animal a is seen in many modern diapsid predator the crest and frill of some dinosaur like the marginocephalian theropod and lambeosaurines may have been too fragile to be used for active defense and so they were likely used for sexual or aggressive display though little is known about dinosaur mating and territorialism head wound from bite suggest that theropod at least engaged in active aggressive confrontationsfrom a behavioral standpoint one of the most valuable dinosaur fossil wa discovered in the gobi desert in it included a velociraptor attacking a protoceratops providing evidence that dinosaur did indeed attack each other additional evidence for attacking live prey is the partially healed tail of an edmontosaurus a hadrosaurid dinosaur the tail is damaged in such a way that show the animal wa bitten by a tyrannosaur but survived cannibalism amongst some specie of dinosaur wa confirmed by tooth mark found in madagascar in involving the theropod majungasauruscomparisons between the scleral ring of dinosaur and modern bird and reptile have been used to infer daily activity pattern of dinosaur although it ha been suggested that most dinosaur were active during the day these comparison have shown that small predatory dinosaur such a dromaeosaurids juravenator and megapnosaurus were likely nocturnal large and herbivorous and omnivorous dinosaur such a ceratopsian sauropodomorphs hadrosaurids ornithomimosaurs may have been cathemeral active during short interval throughout the day although the small ornithischian agilisaurus wa inferred to be diurnalbased on current fossil evidence from dinosaur such a oryctodromeus some ornithischian specie seem to have led a partially fossorial burrowing lifestyle many modern bird are arboreal tree climbing and this wa also true of many mesozoic bird especially the enantiornithines while some early specie may have already been arboreal a well including dromaeosaurids such a microraptor most dinosaur seem to have relied on locomotion a good understanding of how dinosaur moved on the ground is key to model of dinosaur behavior the science of biomechanics pioneered by robert mcneill alexander ha provided significant insight in this area for example study of the force exerted by muscle and gravity on dinosaur skeletal structure have investigated how fast dinosaur could run whether diplodocids could create sonic boom via tail snapping and whether sauropod could float communication modern bird are known to communicate using visual and auditory signal and the wide diversity of visual display structure among fossil dinosaur group such a horn frill crest sail and feather suggests that visual communication ha always been important in dinosaur biology reconstruction of the plumage color of anchiornis huxleyi suggest the importance of color in visual communication in dinosaur the evolution of dinosaur vocalization is le certain paleontologist phil senter suggests that dinosaur relied mostly on visual display and possibly acoustic sound like hissing jaw grinding or clapping splashing and wing beating possible in winged maniraptoran dinosaur he state they were unlikely to have been capable of vocalizing since their closest relative crocodilian and bird use different mean to vocalize the former via the larynx and the latter through the unique syrinx suggesting they evolved independently and their common ancestor wa mutethe earliest remains of a syrinx which ha enough mineral content for fossilization wa found in a specimen of the vegavis iaai dated million year ago and this organ is unlikely to have existed in dinosaur however in contrast to senter the researcher have suggested that dinosaur could vocalize and that the vocal system of bird evolved from a one rather than the two system evolving independently a study suggests that dinosaur produced closed mouth vocalization like cooing which occur in both crocodilian and bird a well a other reptile such vocalization evolved independently in extant archosaur numerous time following increase in body size the crest of the lambeosaurini and nasal chamber of ankylosaurids have been suggested to function in vocal resonance though senter state that the presence of resonance chamber in some dinosaur is not necessarily evidence of vocalization a modern snake have such chamber which intensify their hiss reproductive biology all dinosaur laid amniotic egg with hard shell made mostly of calcium carbonate dinosaur egg were usually laid in a nest most specie create somewhat elaborate nest which can be cup dome plate bed scrape mound or burrow some specie of modern bird have no nest the common guillemot lay it egg on bare rock and male emperor penguin keep egg between their body and foot primitive bird and many dinosaur often lay egg in communal nest with male primarily incubating the egg while modern bird have only one functional oviduct and lay one egg at a time more primitive bird and dinosaur had two oviduct like crocodile some dinosaur such a troodon exhibited iterative laying where the adult might lay a pair of egg every one or two day and then ensured simultaneous hatching by delaying brooding until all egg were laidwhen laying egg female grow a special type of bone between the hard outer bone and the marrow of their limb this medullary bone which is rich in calcium is used to make eggshell a discovery of feature in a tyrannosaurus rex skeleton provided evidence of medullary bone in extinct dinosaur and for the first time allowed paleontologist to establish the sex of a fossil dinosaur specimen further research ha found medullary bone in the carnosaur allosaurus and the ornithopod tenontosaurus because the line of dinosaur that includes allosaurus and tyrannosaurus diverged from the line that led to tenontosaurus very early in the evolution of dinosaur this suggests that the production of medullary tissue is a general characteristic of all dinosaur another widespread trait among modern bird but see below in regard to fossil group and extant megapode is parental care for young after hatching jack horner discovery of a maiasaura good mother lizard nesting ground in montana demonstrated that parental care continued long after birth among ornithopod a specimen of the mongolian oviraptorid citipati osmolskae wa discovered in a brooding position in which may indicate that they had begun using an insulating layer of feather to keep the egg warm a dinosaur embryo pertaining to the prosauropod massospondylus wa found without teeth indicating that some parental care wa required to feed the young dinosaur trackways have also confirmed parental behavior among ornithopod from the isle of skye in northwestern scotlandhowever there is ample evidence of precociality or superprecociality among many dinosaur specie particularly theropod for instance bird have been abundantly demonstrated to have had slow growth rate egg burying behavior and the ability to fly soon after birth both tyrannosaurus rex and troodon formosus display juvenile with clear superprecociality and likely occupying different ecological niche than the adult superprecociality ha been inferred for sauropod physiology because both modern crocodilian and bird have heart albeit modified in crocodilian it is likely that this is a trait shared by all archosaur including all dinosaur while all modern bird have high metabolism and are endothermic a vigorous debate ha been ongoing since the regarding how far back in the dinosaur lineage this trait extends scientist disagree a to whether dinosaur were endothermic ectothermic or some combination of bothafter dinosaur were discovered paleontologist first posited that they were ectothermic this supposed wa used to imply that the ancient dinosaur were relatively slow sluggish organism even though many modern reptile are fast and despite relying on external source of heat to regulate their body temperature the idea of dinosaur a ectothermic remained a prevalent view until robert t bob bakker an early proponent of dinosaur endothermy published an influential paper on the topic in evidence indicates that some dinosaur thrived in cooler temperate climate and that some early specie must have regulated their body temperature by internal biological mean aided by the animal bulk in large specie and feather or other body covering in smaller specie evidence of endothermy in mesozoic dinosaur includes the discovery of polar dinosaur in australia and antarctica a well a analysis of structure within fossil bone that are typical of endotherms scientific debate continues regarding the specific way in which dinosaur temperature regulation evolved in saurischian dinosaur higher metabolism were supported by the evolution of the avian respiratory system characterized by an extensive system of air sac that extended the lung and invaded many of the bone in the skeleton making them hollow early respiratory system with air sac may have been capable of sustaining higher activity level than those of mammal of similar size and build in addition to providing a very efficient supply of oxygen the rapid airflow would have been an effective cooling mechanism which is essential for animal that are active but too large to get rid of all the excess heat through their skinlike other reptile dinosaur are primarily uricotelic that is their kidney extract nitrogenous waste from their bloodstream and excrete it a uric acid instead of urea or ammonia via the ureter into the intestine in most living specie uric acid is excreted along with feces a a semisolid waste however at least some modern bird such a hummingbird can be facultatively ammonotelic excreting most of the nitrogenous waste a ammonia this material a well a the output of the intestine emerges from the cloaca in addition many specie regurgitate pellet and fossil pellet that may have come from dinosaur are known from a long ago a the cretaceous origin of bird the possibility that dinosaur were the ancestor of bird wa first suggested in by thomas henry huxley after the work of gerhard heilmann in the early century the theory of bird a dinosaur descendant wa abandoned in favor of the idea of their being descendant of generalized thecodont with the key piece of evidence being the supposed lack of clavicle in dinosaur however a later discovery showed clavicle or a single fused wishbone which derived from separate clavicle were not actually absent they had been found a early a in oviraptor but misidentified a an interclavicle in the john ostrom revived the theory which gained momentum in the coming decade with the advent of cladistic analysis and a great increase in the discovery of small theropod and early bird of particular note have been the fossil of the yixian formation where a variety of theropod and early bird have been found often with feather of some type bird share over a hundred distinct anatomical feature with theropod dinosaur which are now generally accepted to have been their closest ancient relative they are most closely allied with maniraptoran coelurosaurs a minority of scientist most notably alan feduccia and larry martin have proposed other evolutionary path including revised version of heilmann basal archosaur proposal or that maniraptoran theropod are the ancestor of bird but themselves are not dinosaur only convergent with dinosaur feather feather are one of the most recognizable characteristic of modern bird and a trait that wa shared by all other dinosaur group based on the current distribution of fossil evidence it appears that feather were an ancestral dinosaurian trait though one that may have been selectively lost in some specie direct fossil evidence of feather or structure ha been discovered in a diverse array of specie in many dinosaur group both among saurischian and ornithischian simple branched structure are known from heterodontosaurids primitive neornithischians and theropod and primitive ceratopsian evidence for true vaned feather similar to the flight feather of modern bird ha been found only in the theropod subgroup maniraptora which includes oviraptorosaurs troodontids dromaeosaurids and bird structure known a pycnofibres have also been found in pterosaur suggesting the possibility that filament may have been common in the bird lineage and evolved before the appearance of dinosaur themselves research into the genetics of american alligator ha also revealed that crocodylian scute do posse during embryonic development but these keratin are not expressed by the animal before hatchingarchaeopteryx wa the first fossil found that revealed a potential connection between dinosaur and bird it is considered a transitional fossil in that it display feature of both group brought to light just two year after charles darwin seminal on the origin of specie it discovery spurred the nascent debate between proponent of evolutionary biology and creationism this early bird is so that without a clear impression of feather in the surrounding rock at least one specimen wa mistaken for compsognathus since the a number of additional feathered dinosaur have been found providing even stronger evidence of the close relationship between dinosaur and modern bird most of these specimen were unearthed in the lagerstatte of the yixian formation liaoning northeastern china which wa part of an island continent during the cretaceous though feather have been found in only a few location it is possible that dinosaur elsewhere in the world were also feathered the lack of widespread fossil evidence for feathered dinosaur may be because delicate feature like skin and feather are not often preserved by fossilization and thus are absent from the fossil recordthe description of feathered dinosaur ha not been without controversy perhaps the most vocal critic have been alan feduccia and theagarten who have proposed that some purported fossil are the result of the decomposition of collagenous fiber that underlaid the dinosaur skin and that maniraptoran dinosaur with vaned feather were not actually dinosaur but convergent with dinosaur however their view have for the most part not been accepted by other researcher to the point that the scientific nature of feduccia proposal ha been questionedin it wa reported that a dinosaur tail with feather had been found enclosed in amber the fossil is about million year old skeleton because feather are often associated with bird feathered dinosaur are often touted a the missing link between bird and dinosaur however the multiple skeletal feature also shared by the two group represent another important line of evidence for paleontologist area of the skeleton with important similarity include the neck pubis wrist carpal arm and pectoral girdle furcula wishbone and breast bone comparison of bird and dinosaur skeleton through cladistic analysis strengthens the case for the link soft anatomy large dinosaur had a complex system of air sac similar to those found in modern bird according to a investigation led by patrick m the lung of theropod dinosaur carnivore that walked on two leg and had foot likely pumped air into hollow sac in their skeleton a is the case in bird what wa once formally considered unique to bird wa present in some form in the ancestor of bird said in scientist described aerosteon riocoloradensis the skeleton of which supply the strongest evidence to date of a dinosaur with a breathing system ct scanning of aerosteon fossil bone revealed evidence for the existence of air sac within the animal body cavity behavioral evidence fossil of the troodonts mei and sinornithoides demonstrate that some dinosaur slept with their head tucked under their arm this behavior which may have helped to keep the head warm is also characteristic of modern bird several deinonychosaur and oviraptorosaur specimen have also been found preserved on top of their nest likely brooding in a manner the ratio between egg volume and body mass of adult among these dinosaur suggest that the egg were primarily brooded by the male and that the young were highly precocial similar to many modern birdssome dinosaur are known to have used gizzard stone like modern bird these stone are swallowed by animal to aid digestion and break down food and hard fiber once they enter the stomach when found in association with fossil gizzard stone are called gastroliths extinction of major group the discovery that bird are a type of dinosaur showed that dinosaur in general are not in fact extinct a is commonly stated however all dinosaur estimated to have been specie a well a many group of bird did suddenly become extinct approximately million year ago it ha been suggested that because small mammal squamata and bird occupied the ecological niche suited for small body size dinosaur never evolved a diverse fauna of specie which led to their downfall when terrestrial tetrapod were hit by the mass extinction event many other group of animal also became extinct at this time including ammonite mollusk mosasaurs plesiosaur pterosaur and many group of mammal significantly the insect suffered no discernible population loss which left them available a food for other survivor this mass extinction is known a the extinction event the nature of the event that caused this mass extinction ha been extensively studied since the at present several related theory are supported by paleontologist though the consensus is that an impact event wa the primary cause of dinosaur extinction some scientist cite other possible cause or support the idea that a confluence of several factor wa responsible for the sudden disappearance of dinosaur from the fossil record impact event the asteroid impact hypothesis which wa brought to wide attention in by walter alvarez and colleague link the extinction event at the end of the cretaceous to a bolide impact approximately million year ago alvarez et al proposed that a sudden increase in iridium level recorded around the world in the period rock stratum wa direct evidence of the impact the bulk of the evidence now suggests that a bolide to kilometer to mile wide hit in the vicinity of the yucatan peninsula in southeastern mexico creating the approximately km mi chicxulub crater and triggering the mass extinction scientist are not certain whether dinosaur were thriving or declining before the impact event some scientist propose that the meteorite impact caused a long and unnatural drop in earth atmospheric temperature while others claim that it would have instead created an unusual heat wave the consensus among scientist who support this hypothesis is that the impact caused extinction both directly by heat from the meteorite impact and also indirectly via a worldwide cooling brought about when matter ejected from the impact crater reflected thermal radiation from the sun although the speed of extinction can not be deduced from the fossil record alone various model suggest that the extinction wa extremely rapid being down to hour rather than year in scientist drilling into the seafloor off mexico extracted a unique geologic record of what they believe to be the day a asteroid smashed into the planet deccan trap before argument that the deccan trap flood basalt caused the extinction were usually linked to the view that the extinction wa gradual a the flood basalt event were thought to have started around million year ago and lasted for over million year however there is evidence that two third of the deccan trap were created in only million year about million year ago and so these eruption would have caused a fairly rapid extinction possibly over a period of thousand of year but still longer than would be expected from a single impact eventthe deccan trap in india could have caused extinction through several mechanism including the release into the air of dust and sulfuric aerosol which might have blocked sunlight and thereby reduced photosynthesis in plant in addition deccan trap volcanism might have resulted in carbon dioxide emission which would have increased the greenhouse effect when the dust and aerosol cleared from the atmosphere before the mass extinction of the dinosaur the release of volcanic gas during the formation of the deccan trap contributed to an apparently massive global warming some data point to an average rise in temperature of in the last year before the impact at chicxulub in the year when the deccan trap hypothesis wa linked to a slower extinction luis alvarez who died in replied that paleontologist were being misled by sparse data while his assertion wa not initially later intensive field study of fossil bed lent weight to his claim eventually most paleontologist began to accept the idea that the mass extinction at the end of the cretaceous were largely or at least partly due to a massive earth impact however even walter alvarez ha acknowledged that there were other major change on earth even before the impact such a a drop in sea level and massive volcanic eruption that produced the indian deccan trap and these may have contributed to the extinction possible paleocene survivor dinosaur remains are occasionally found above the boundary in paleontologist spencer g lucas et al reported the discovery of a single hadrosaur right femur in the san juan basin new mexico and described it a evidence of paleocene dinosaur the formation in which the bone wa discovered ha been dated to the early paleocene epoch approximately million year ago if the bone wa not into that stratum by weathering action it would provide evidence that some dinosaur population may have survived at least a year into the cenozoic other evidence includes the finding of dinosaur remains in the hell creek formation up to m in above the boundary representing year of elapsed time similar report have come from other part of the world including china many scientist however dismissed the supposed paleocene dinosaur a that is washed out of their original location and then in much later sediment direct dating of the bone themselves ha supported the later date with dating method resulting in a precise age of million year ago if correct the presence of a handful of dinosaur in the early paleocene would not change the underlying fact of the extinction history of study dinosaur fossil have been known for millennium although their true nature wa not recognized the chinese considered them to be dragon bone and documented them a such for example huayang guo zhi Hua Yang Guo Zhi  a gazetteer compiled by chang qu Chang Qu  during the western jin dynasty reported the discovery of dragon bone at wucheng in sichuan province villager in central china have long unearthed fossilized dragon bone for use in traditional medicine in europe dinosaur fossil were generally believed to be the remains of giant and other biblical creaturesscholarly description of what would now be recognized a dinosaur bone first appeared in the late century in england part of a bone now known to have been the femur of a megalosaurus wa recovered from a limestone quarry at cornwell near chipping norton oxfordshire in the fragment wa sent to robert plot professor of chemistry at the university of oxford and first curator of the ashmolean museum who published a description in his the natural history of he correctly identified the bone a the lower extremity of the femur of a large animal and recognized that it wa too large to belong to any known specie he therefore concluded it to be the femur of a huge human perhaps a titan or another type of giant featured in legend edward lhuyd a friend of sir isaac newton published lithophylacii britannici ichnographia the first scientific treatment of what would now be recognized a a dinosaur when he described and named a sauropod tooth rutellum impicatum that had been found in caswell near witney oxfordshire between and the rev william buckland the first reader of geology at the university of oxford collected more fossilized bone of megalosaurus and became the first person to describe a dinosaur in a scientific journal the second dinosaur genus to be identified iguanodon wa discovered in by mary ann mantell the wife of english geologist gideon mantell gideon mantell recognized similarity between his fossil and the bone of modern iguana he published his finding in study of these great fossil lizard soon became of great interest to european and american scientist and in the english paleontologist richard owen coined the term dinosaur he recognized that the remains that had been found so far iguanodon megalosaurus and hylaeosaurus shared a number of distinctive feature and so decided to present them a a distinct taxonomic group with the backing of prince albert the husband of queen victoria owen established the natural history museum london to display the national collection of dinosaur fossil and other biological and geological exhibitsin william parker foulke discovered the first known american dinosaur in marl pit in the small town of haddonfield new jersey although fossil had been found before their nature had not been correctly discerned the creature wa named hadrosaurus foulkii it wa an extremely important find hadrosaurus wa one of the first nearly complete dinosaur skeleton found the first wa in in maidstone england and it wa clearly a bipedal creature this wa a revolutionary discovery a until that point most scientist had believed dinosaur walked on four foot like other lizard foulke discovery sparked a wave of interest in dinosaur in the united state known a dinosaur mania dinosaur mania wa exemplified by the fierce rivalry between edward drinker cope and othniel charles marsh both of whom raced to be the first to find new dinosaur in what came to be known a the bone war the feud probably originated when marsh publicly pointed out that cope reconstruction of an elasmosaurus skeleton wa flawed cope had inadvertently placed the plesiosaur head at what should have been the animal tail end the fight between the two scientist lasted for over year ending in when cope died after spending his entire fortune on the dinosaur hunt unfortunately many valuable dinosaur specimen were damaged or destroyed due to the pair rough method for example their digger often used dynamite to unearth bone modern paleontologist would find such method crude and unacceptable since blasting easily destroys fossil and stratigraphic evidence despite their unrefined method the contribution of cope and marsh to paleontology were vast marsh unearthed new specie of dinosaur and cope discovered a total of new specie cope collection is now at the american museum of natural history while marsh is on display at the peabody museum of natural history at yale universityafter the search for dinosaur fossil extended to every continent including antarctica the first antarctic dinosaur to be discovered the ankylosaurid antarctopelta oliveroi wa found on james ross island in although it wa before an antarctic specie the theropod cryolophosaurus ellioti wa formally named and described in a scientific journalcurrent dinosaur hot spot include southern south america especially argentina and china china in particular ha produced many exceptional feathered dinosaur specimen due to the unique geology of it dinosaur bed a well a an ancient arid climate particularly conducive to fossilization dinosaur renaissance the field of dinosaur research ha enjoyed a surge in activity that began in the and is ongoing this wa triggered in part by john ostrom discovery of deinonychus an active predator that may have been in marked contrast to the image of dinosaur a sluggish and vertebrate paleontology ha become a global science major new dinosaur discovery have been made by paleontologist working in previously unexploited region including india south america madagascar antarctica and most significantly china the feathered dinosaur in china have further consolidated the link between dinosaur and their living descendant modern bird the widespread application of cladistics which rigorously analyzes the relationship between biological organism ha also proved tremendously useful in classifying dinosaur cladistic analysis among other modern technique help to compensate for an often incomplete and fragmentary fossil record soft tissue and dna one of the best example of impression in a fossil dinosaur wa discovered in the pietraroia plattenkalk in southern italy the discovery wa reported in and described the specimen of a small very young coelurosaur scipionyx samniticus the fossil includes portion of the intestine colon liver muscle and windpipe of this immature dinosaurin the march issue of science the paleontologist mary higby schweitzer and her team announced the discovery of flexible material resembling actual soft tissue inside a tyrannosaurus rex leg bone from the hell creek formation in montana after recovery the tissue wa rehydrated by the science team when the fossilized bone wa treated over several week to remove mineral content from the fossilized cavity a process called demineralization schweitzer found evidence of intact structure such a blood vessel bone matrix and connective tissue bone fiber scrutiny under the microscope further revealed that the putative dinosaur soft tissue had retained fine structure microstructures even at the cellular level the exact nature and composition of this material and the implication of schweitzer discovery are not yet clearin a team including schweitzer announced that using even more careful methodology they had duplicated their result by finding similar soft tissue in a dinosaur brachylophosaurus canadensis found in the judith river formation of montana this included even more detailed tissue down to preserved bone cell that seem even to have visible remnant of nucleus and what seem to be red blood cell among other material found in the bone wa collagen a in the tyrannosaurus bone the type of collagen an animal ha in it bone varies according to it dna and in both case this collagen wa of the same type found in modern chicken and ostrichesthe extraction of ancient dna from dinosaur fossil ha been reported on two separate occasion upon further inspection and peer review however neither of these report could be confirmed however a functional peptide involved in the vision of a theoretical dinosaur ha been inferred using analytical phylogenetic reconstruction method on gene sequence of related modern specie such a reptile and bird in addition several protein including hemoglobin have putatively been detected in dinosaur fossilsin researcher reported finding structure similar to blood cell and collagen fiber preserved in the bone fossil of six cretaceous dinosaur specimen which are approximately million year old cultural depiction by human standard dinosaur were creature of fantastic appearance and often enormous size a such they have captured the popular imagination and become an enduring part of human culture the entry of the word dinosaur into the common vernacular reflects the animal cultural importance in english dinosaur is commonly used to describe anything that is impractically large obsolete or bound for extinctionpublic enthusiasm for dinosaur first developed in victorian england where in three decade after the first scientific description of dinosaur remains a menagerie of lifelike dinosaur sculpture wa unveiled in london crystal palace park the crystal palace dinosaur proved so popular that a strong market in smaller replica soon developed in subsequent decade dinosaur exhibit opened at park and museum around the world ensuring that successive generation would be introduced to the animal in an immersive and exciting way dinosaur enduring popularity in it turn ha resulted in significant public funding for dinosaur science and ha frequently spurred new discovery in the united state for example the competition between museum for public attention led directly to the bone war of the and during which a pair of feuding paleontologist made enormous scientific contributionsthe popular preoccupation with dinosaur ha ensured their appearance in literature film and other medium beginning in with a passing mention in charles dickens bleak house dinosaur have been featured in large number of fictional work jules verne novel journey to the center of the earth sir arthur conan doyle book the lost world the iconic film king kong the godzilla and it many sequel the novel jurassic park by michael crichton and it film adaptation are just a few notable example of dinosaur appearance in fiction author of work about dinosaur including some prominent paleontologist who have often sought to use the animal a a way to educate reader about science in general dinosaur are ubiquitous in advertising numerous company have referenced dinosaur in printed or televised advertisement
