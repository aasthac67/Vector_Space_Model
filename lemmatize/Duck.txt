duck is the common name for numerous specie in the waterfowl family anatidae which also includes swan and goose duck are divided among several subfamily in the family anatidae they do not represent a monophyletic group the group of all descendant of a single common ancestral specie but a form taxon since swan and goose are not considered duck duck are mostly aquatic bird mostly smaller than the swan and goose and may be found in both fresh water and sea water duck are sometimes confused with several type of unrelated water bird with similar form such a loon or diver grebe gallinule and coot etymology the word duck come from old english duce diver a derivative of the verb ducan to duck bend down low a if to get under something or dive because of the way many specie in the dabbling duck group feed by upending compare with dutch duiken and german tauchen to dive this word replaced old english duck possibly to avoid confusion with other old english word like ende end with similar form other germanic language still have similar word for duck for example dutch eend duck german ente duck and norwegian and duck the word wa inherited from compare latin ana duck lithuanian anti duck ancient greek nessa netta duck and sanskrit ati water bird among others a duckling is a young duck in downy plumage or baby duck but in the food trade a young domestic duck which ha just reached adult size and bulk and it meat is still fully tender is sometimes labelled a a duckling a male duck is called a drake and the female is called a duck or in ornithology a hen morphology the overall body plan of duck is elongated and broad and the duck are also relatively albeit not a a the goose and swan the body shape of diving duck varies somewhat from this in being more rounded the bill is usually broad and contains serrated pectens which are particularly well defined in the specie in the case of some fishing specie the bill is long and strongly serrated the scaled leg are strong and well developed and generally set far back on the body more so in the highly aquatic specie the wing are very strong and are generally short and pointed and the flight of duck requires fast continuous stroke requiring in turn strong wing muscle three specie of steamer duck are almost flightless however many specie of duck are temporarily flightless while moulting they seek out protected habitat with good food supply during this period this moult typically precedes migration the drake of northern specie often have extravagant plumage but that is moulted in summer to give a more appearance the eclipse plumage southern resident specie typically show le sexual dimorphism although there are exception such a the paradise shelduck of new zealand which is both strikingly sexually dimorphic and in which the female plumage is brighter than that of the male the plumage of juvenile bird generally resembles that of the female over the course of evolution female duck have evolved to have a corkscrew shaped vagina to prevent rape behaviour feeding duck eat a variety of food source such a grass aquatic plant fish insect small amphibian worm and small mollusc dabbling duck feed on the surface of water or on land or a deep a they can reach by without completely submerging along the edge of the beak there is a structure called a pecten this strain the water squirting from the side of the beak and trap any food the pecten is also used to preen feather and to hold slippery food item diving duck and sea duck forage deep underwater to be able to submerge more easily the diving duck are heavier than dabbling duck and therefore have more difficulty taking off to fly a few specialized specie such a the merganser are adapted to catch and swallow large fish the others have the characteristic wide flat beak adapted to job such a pulling up waterweed pulling worm and small mollusc out of mud searching for insect larva and bulk job such a dredging out holding turning head first and swallowing a squirming frog to avoid injury when digging into sediment it ha no cere but the nostril come out through hard horn the guardian british newspaper published an article advising that duck should not be fed with bread because it damage the health of the duck and pollutes waterway breeding duck generally only have one partner at a time although the partnership usually only last one year larger specie and the more sedentary specie like specialist tend to have that last numerous year most duck specie breed once a year choosing to do so in favourable condition or wet season duck also tend to make a nest before breeding and after hatching lead their duckling to water mother duck are very caring and protective of their young but may abandon some of their duckling if they are physically stuck in an area they can not get out of such a nesting in an enclosed courtyard or are not prospering due to genetic defect or sickness brought about by hypothermia starvation or disease duckling can also be orphaned by inconsistent late hatching where a few egg hatch after the mother ha abandoned the nest and led her duckling to water most domestic duck neglect their egg and duckling and their egg must be hatched under a broody hen or artificially communication female mallard duck a well a several other specie in the genus ana such a the american and pacific black duck make the classic quack sound while male make a similar but raspier sound that is sometimes written a breeeeze but despite widespread misconception most specie of duck do not quack in general duck make a wide range of call ranging from whistle cooing yodel and grunt for example the scaup which are diving duck make a noise like scaup hence their name call may be loud displaying call or quieter contact call a common urban legend claim that duck quack do not echo however this ha been proven to be false this myth wa first debunked by the acoustic research centre at the university of salford in a part of the british association festival of science it wa also debunked in one of the earlier episode of the popular discovery channel television show mythbusters distribution and habitat the duck have a cosmopolitan distribution a number of specie manage to live on island like south georgia and the auckland island numerous duck have managed to establish themselves on oceanic island such a hawaii new zealand and kerguelen although many of these specie and population are threatened or have become extinct some duck specie mainly those breeding in the temperate and arctic northern hemisphere are migratory those in the tropic however are generally not some duck particularly in australia where rainfall is patchy and erratic are nomadic seeking out the temporary lake and pool that form after localised heavy rain predator worldwide duck have many predator duckling are particularly vulnerable since their inability to fly make them easy prey not only for predatory bird but also for large fish like pike crocodilian predatory testudo such a the alligator snapping turtle and other aquatic hunter including bird such a heron duck nest are raided by predator and brooding female may be caught unaware on the nest by mammal such a fox or large bird such a hawk or owl adult duck are fast flier but may be caught on the water by large aquatic predator including big fish such a the north american muskie and the european pike in flight duck are safe from all but a few predator such a human and the peregrine falcon which regularly us it speed and strength to catch duck relationship with human domestication duck have many economic us being farmed for their meat egg and feather particularly their down approximately billion duck are slaughtered each year for meat worldwide they are also kept and bred by aviculturists and often displayed in zoo almost all the variety of domestic duck are descended from the mallard ana platyrhynchos apart from the muscovy duck cairina moschata the call duck is another example of a domestic duck breed it name come from it original use established by hunter a a decoy to attract wild mallard from the sky into trap set for them on the ground the call duck is the world smallest domestic duck breed a it weighs le than kg lb hunting in many area wild duck of various specie including duck farmed and released into the wild are hunted for food or sport by shooting or formerly by being trapped using duck decoy because an idle floating duck or a duck squatting on land can not react to fly or move quickly a sitting duck ha come to mean an easy target these duck may be contaminated by pollutant such a pcbs cultural reference in psychologist richard wiseman and colleague at the university of hertfordshire uk finished a laughlab experiment concluding that of all animal duck attract the most humor and silliness he said if you going to tell a joke involving an animal make it a duck the word duck may have become an inherently funny word in many language possibly because duck are seen a silly in their look or behavior of the many duck in fiction many are cartoon character such a walt disney donald duck and warner bros daffy duck howard the duck started a a comic book character in and wa made into a movie in the disney film the mighty duck starring emilio estevez chose the duck a the mascot for the fictional youth hockey team who are protagonist of the movie based on the duck being described a a fierce fighter this led to the duck becoming the nickname and mascot for the eventual national hockey league professional team anaheim
