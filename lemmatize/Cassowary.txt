cassowary genus casuarius are ratite flightless bird without a keel on their sternum bone that are native to the tropical forest of new guinea papua new guinea and indonesia east nusa tenggara the maluku island and northeastern australiathere are three extant specie the most common of these the southern cassowary is the and living bird smaller only than the ostrich and emu cassowary feed mainly on fruit although all specie are truly omnivorous and will take a range of other plant food including shoot and grass seed in addition to fungi invertebrate and small vertebrate cassowary are very wary of human but if provoked they are capable of inflicting serious even fatal injury to both dog and people the cassowary ha often been labeled the world most dangerous bird taxonomy systematics and evolution the genus casuarius wa erected by the french scientist mathurin jacques brisson in his ornithologie published in the type specie is the southern cassowary casuarius casuarius the swedish naturalist carl linnaeus had introduced the genus casuarius in the sixth edition of his systema naturae published in but linnaeus dropped the genus in the important tenth edition of and put the southern cassowary together with the common ostrich and the greater rhea in the genus struthio a the publication date of linnaeus sixth edition wa before the starting point of the international commission on zoological nomenclature brisson and not linnaeus is considered a the authority for the genuscassowaries from malay kasuari are part of the ratite group which also includes the emu rhea ostrich and kiwi a well a the extinct moa and elephant bird three extant specie are recognised and one extinct most authority consider the taxonomic classification above to be monotypic however several subspecies of each have been described and some of them have even been suggested a separate specie eg c b papuanus the taxonomic name c b papuanus also may be in need of revision to casuarius bennetti westermanni validation of these subspecies ha proven difficult due to individual variation variation the scarcity of specimen the stability of specimen the bright skin of the head and basis of describing several in specimen and the practice of trading live cassowary for thousand of year some of which are likely to have escaped or deliberately introduced to region away from their origin the evolutionary history of cassowary a of all ratite is not well known a fossil specie wa reported from australia but for reason of biogeography this assignment is not certain and it might belong to the prehistoric emuarius which were primitive emu all ratite are believed to have originally come from the gondwana which separated around million year ago study show that ratite continued to evolve after this separation into their modern counterpart description typically all cassowary are shy bird that are found in the deep forest they are adept at disappearing long before a human know they were there the southern cassowary of the far north queensland rain forest is not well studied and the northern and dwarf cassowary even le so female are larger and more brightly coloured than the male adult southern cassowary are to m ft tall although some female may reach m ft and weigh kg lb all cassowary have feather that consist of a shaft and loose barbules they do not have rectrices tail feather or a preen gland cassowary have small wing with large remiges these are reduced to stiff keratinous quill resembling porcupine quill with no barb a claw exists on each second digit of the foot the furcula and coracoid are degenerate and their palatal bone and sphenoid bone touch each other these along with their body are thought to be adaptation to ward off vine thorn and leaf allowing them to run quickly through the rainforest cassowary have foot with sharp claw the second toe the inner one in the medial position sport a claw that may be mm in long this claw is particularly fearsome since cassowary sometimes kick human and other animal with their powerful leg cassowary can run at up to mph through the dense forest and can jump up to m ft they are good swimmer crossing wide river and swimming in the sea all three specie have a keratinous casque on their head that grows with age the casque shape and size up to cm in is casuarius casuarius ha the largest and casuarius bennetti the smallest tricorn shape with casuarius unappendiculatus having variation in between contrary to earlier finding the hollow inside of the casque is spanned with fine fibre that are believed to have an acoustic function several function for the casque have been proposed one is that they are a secondary sexual characteristic other suggested function include being used to batter through underbrush a a weapon in dominance dispute or for pushing aside leaf litter during foraging the latter three are disputed by biologist andrew mack whose personal observation suggests that the casque amplifies deep soundsearlier research indicates the bird lower their head when running full tilt through the vegetation brushing sapling aside and occasionally careening into small tree the casque would help protect the skull from such collision cassowary eat fallen fruit and consequently spend much time under tree where seed the size of golfballs or larger fall from height of up to m ft the casque may protect the head by deflecting falling fruitit also ha been speculated that the casque play a role in either sound reception or acoustic communication this is related to a discovery that at least the dwarf cassowary and southern cassowary produce frequency sound which may aid in communication in dense rainforest the boom vocalisation that cassowary produce is the bird call known and is at the lower limit of human hearing a cooling function for the very similar casque of guineafowl ha been proposed the average lifespan of wild cassowary is believed to be about to year distribution and habitat cassowary are native to the humid rainforest of new guinea nearby smaller island east nusa tenggara the maluku island and to northeastern australia they will however venture out into palm scrub grassland savanna and swamp forest it is unclear whether some island population are natural or the result of human trade in young bird behaviour and ecology cassowary are solitary bird except during courtship and sometimes around ample food supply the male cassowary defends a territory of about acre for himself and his mate female cassowary have larger territory overlapping those of several male while female move among satellite territory of different male they appear to remain within the same territory for most of their life mating with the same or closely related male over the course of their life span courtship and pair bonding ritual begin with the vibratory sound broadcast by female male approach and run with neck parallel to the ground while making dramatic movement of the head which accentuate the frontal neck region the female approach drumming slowly the male will crouch upon the ground and the female will either step on the male back for a moment before crouching beside him in preparation for copulation or she may attack this is often the case with the female pursuing the male in ritualistic chasing behaviour that generally terminate in water the male cassowary dive into water and submerges himself up to his upper neck and head the female pursues him into the water where he eventually drive her to the shallow where she crouch making ritualistic motion of her head the two may remain in copulation for extended period of time in some case another male may approach and run off the first male he will climb onto her to copulate a well male are far more tolerant of one another than female which do not tolerate the presence of other female reproduction the cassowary breeding season start in may to june female lay three to eight large bright green or pale egg in each clutch into a heap of leaf litter prepared by the male the egg measure about by cm by in only ostrich and emu egg are larger the male incubates those egg for day removing or adding litter to regulate the temperature then protects the chick who stay in the nest for about nine month he defends them fiercely against all potential predator including human the young male later go off to find a territory of their ownthe female doe not care for the egg or the chick but rather move on within her territory to lay egg in the nest of several other male young cassowary are brown and have buffy stripe they are often kept a pet in native village in new guinea where they are permitted to roam like barnyard fowl often they are kept until they become nearly grown and someone get hurt mature cassowary are placed beside native house in crib hardly larger than the bird themselves garbage and other vegetable food is fed to them and they live for year in such enclosure in some area their plumage is still a valuable a shell money caged bird are regularly bereft of their fresh plume diet cassowary are predominantly frugivorous but omnivorous opportunistically when small prey is available besides fruit their diet includes flower fungi snail insect frog bird fish rat mouse and carrion fruit from at least plant family ha been documented in the diet of cassowary fruit from the laurel podocarp palm wild grape nightshade and myrtle family are important item in the diet the cassowary plum take it name from the bird where tree are dropping fruit cassowary will come in and feed with each bird defending a tree from others for a few day they move on when the fruit is depleted fruit even item a large a banana and apple is swallowed whole cassowary are a keystone specie of rain forest because they eat fallen fruit whole and distribute seed across the jungle floor via excrementas for eating the cassowary it is supposed to be quite tough australian administrative officer stationed in new guinea were advised that it should be cooked with a stone in the pot when the stone is ready to eat so is the cassowary role in seed dispersal and germination cassowary feed on the fruit of several hundred rainforest specie and usually pas viable seed in large dense scat they are known to disperse seed over distance greater than a kilometre and thus play an important role in the ecosystem germination rate for seed of the rare australian rainforest tree ryparosa were found to be much higher after passing through a cassowary gut versus status and conservation the southern cassowary is endangered in queensland kofron and chapman assessed the decline of this specie they found that of the former cassowary habitat only remains they stated that habitat loss and fragmentation is the primary cause of decline they then studied case of cassowary mortality and found that motor vehicle strike accounted for of the death and dog attack produced another remaining cause of death included hunting case entanglement in wire case the removal of cassowary that attacked human case and natural cause case including tuberculosis case the cause for case were indicated a for unknown reasonshand feeding of cassowary pose a significant threat to their survival because it lure them into suburban area there the bird are more susceptible to encounter with vehicle and dog contact with human encourages cassowary to take food from picnic table feral pig also are a significant threat to their survival they destroy nest and egg of cassowary but their worst effect is a competitor for food which may be catastrophic for the cassowary during lean time in february cyclone yasi destroyed a large area of cassowary habitat endangering of the bird approximately of the total australian populationthe mission beach community in far north queensland hold an annual cassowary festival in september where fund are raised to map the mission beach cassowary corridor in captivity the cassowary ha solitary habit and breed le frequently in zoo than other ratite such a ostrich and emu unlike other ratite it life exclusively in tropical rainforest and it is important to recreate this habitat carefully unlike the emu which will live with other sympatric specie such a kangaroo in mixed australian fauna display the cassowary doe not cohabit well among it own kind individual specimen must even be kept in separate enclosure due to their solitary and aggressive nature territoriality is one of their most important characteristic the cassowary casuarius casuarius is the most popular specie in captivity and it is fairly common in european and american zoo where it is known for it unmistakable appearance a of only weltvogelpark walsrode in germany ha all three specie of cassowary in it collection cassowary casuarius unappendiculatus and bennett cassowary casuarius bennetti both of which are endemic to the tropical rainforest of new guinea and the dwarf cassowary the smallest specie if subspecies are recognised weltvogelpark walsrode ha casuarius bennettii westermanni and casuarius unappendiculatus rufotinctus relationship with human some new guinea highland society capture cassowary chick and raise them a poultry for use in ceremonial gift exchange and a food they are the only indigenous australasian animal known to have been partly domesticated by people prior to european arrival the maring people of kundagai sacrificed cassowary c bennetti in certain ritual the kalam people considered themselves related to cassowary and did not classify them a bird but a kin attack cassowary have a reputation for being dangerous to people and domestic animal during world war ii american and australian troop stationed in new guinea were warned to steer clear of them in his book living bird of the world ornithologist ernest thomas gilliard wrote the inner or second of the three toe is fitted with a long straight murderous nail which can sever an arm or eviscerate an abdomen with ease there are many record of native being killed by this bird this assessment of the danger posed by cassowary ha been repeated in print by author including gregory s paul and jared diamond a historical study of cassowary attack showed that had been against human of these had been from cassowary that had been fed by people of the time the bird had chased or charged the victim of the time they kicked of the attack involved the bird expecting or snatching food involved defending their natural food source involved defending themselves from attack and involved defending their chick or egg only one human death wa reported among those attacksthe first documented human death caused by a cassowary wa on april in australia phillip mcclean and his brother age came across a cassowary on their property and decided to try and kill it by striking it with club the bird kicked the younger boy who fell and ran away a his older brother struck the bird the older mcclean then tripped and fell to the ground while he wa on the ground the cassowary kicked him in the neck opening a cm in wound that may have severed his jugular vein the boy died of his injury shortly thereaftercassowary strike to the abdomen are among the rarest of all but there is one case of a dog that wa kicked in the belly in the blow left no puncture but there wa severe bruising the dog later died from an apparent intestinal ruptureanother human death due to a cassowary wa recorded in florida on april the bird owner a man who had raised the animal wa apparently clawed to death after he fell to the ground see also corythoraptor raptor reference citation cited text uncited text rothschild walter a monograph of the genus casuarius transaction of the zoological
