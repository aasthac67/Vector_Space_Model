caterpillar are the larval stage of member of the order lepidoptera the insect order comprising butterfly and moth a with most common name the application of the word is arbitrary since the larva of sawfly are commonly called caterpillar a well both lepidopteran and symphytan larva have eruciform body shape caterpillar of most specie are herbivorous folivorous but not all some about are insectivorous even cannibalistic some feed on other animal product for example clothes moth feed on wool and horn moth feed on the hoof and horn of dead ungulate caterpillar are typically voracious feeder and many of them are among the most serious of agricultural pest in fact many moth specie are best known in their caterpillar stage because of the damage they cause to fruit and other agricultural produce whereas the moth are obscure and do no direct harm conversely various specie of caterpillar are valued a source of silk a human or animal food or for biological control of pest plant etymology the origin of the word caterpillar date from the early century they derive from middle english catirpel catirpeller probably an alteration of old north french catepelose cate cat from latin cattus pelose hairy from latin pilosus the inchworm or looper caterpillar from the family geometridae are so named because of the way they move appearing to measure the earth the word geometrid mean in greek the primary reason for this unusual locomotion is the elimination of nearly all the prolegs except the clasper on the terminal segment description caterpillar have soft body that can grow rapidly between moult their size varies between specie and instar moult from a small a mm up to cm some larva of the order hymenoptera ant bee and wasp can appear like the caterpillar of the lepidoptera such larva are mainly seen in the sawfly suborder however while these larva superficially resemble caterpillar they can be distinguished by the presence of prolegs on every abdominal segment an absence of crochet or hook on the prolegs these are present on lepidopteran caterpillar one pair of prominent ocellus on the head capsule and an absence of the suture on the front of the headlepidopteran caterpillar can be differentiated from sawfly larva by the number of pair of sawfly larva have or more pair while caterpillar have a maximum of pair the number of stemma simple eye the sawfly larva have only two while caterpillar usually have twelve six each side of the head the presence of crochet on the prolegs these are absent in the sawfly sawfly larva have an invariably smooth head capsule with no cleavage line while lepidopterous caterpillar bear an inverted y or v adfrontal suture fossil in a geometrid moth caterpillar dating back to the eocene epoch approximately million year ago wa found preserved in baltic amber it wa described under eogeometer vadens previously another fossil dating back approximately million year wa found in lebanese amber defense many animal feed on caterpillar a they are rich in protein a a result caterpillar have evolved various mean of defense caterpillar have evolved defense against physical condition such a cold hot or dry environmental condition some arctic specie like gynaephora groenlandica have special basking and aggregation behaviour apart from physiological adaptation to remain in a dormant state appearance the appearance of a caterpillar can often repel a predator it marking and certain body part can make it seem poisonous or bigger in size and thus threatening or some type of caterpillar are indeed poisonous or distasteful and their bright coloring is aposematic others may mimic dangerous caterpillar or other animal while not being dangerous themselves many caterpillar are cryptically colored and resemble the plant on which they feed an example of caterpillar that use camouflage for defence is the specie nemoria arizonaria if the caterpillar hatch in the spring and feed on oak catkin they appear green if they hatch in the summer they appear dark colored like oak twig the differential development is linked to the tannin content in the diet caterpillar may even have spine or growth that resemble plant part such a thorn some look like object in the environment such a bird droppings some geometridae cover themselves in plant part while bagworms construct and live in a bag covered in sand pebble or plant material chemical defense more aggressive measure are taken by some caterpillar these measure include having spiny bristle or long fine seta with detachable tip that will irritate by lodging in the skin or mucous membrane however some bird such a cuckoo will swallow even the hairiest of caterpillar other caterpillar acquire toxin from their host plant that render them unpalatable to most of their predator for instance ornate moth caterpillar utilize pyrrolizidine alkaloid that they obtain from their food plant to deter predator the most aggressive caterpillar defense are bristle associated with venom gland these bristle are called urticating hair a venom which is among the most potent defensive chemical in any animal is produced by the south american silk moth genus lonomia it venom is an anticoagulant powerful enough to cause a human to hemorrhage to death see lonomiasis this chemical is being investigated for potential medical application most urticating hair range in effect from mild irritation to dermatitis example moth plant contain toxin which protect them from herbivore but some caterpillar have evolved countermeasure which enable them to eat the leaf of such toxic plant in addition to being unaffected by the poison the caterpillar sequester it in their body making them highly toxic to predator the chemical are also carried on into the adult stage these toxic specie such a the cinnabar moth tyria jacobaeae and monarch danau plexippus caterpillar usually advertise themselves with the danger color of red yellow and black often in bright stripe see aposematism any predator that attempt to eat a caterpillar with an aggressive defense mechanism will learn and avoid future attempt some caterpillar regurgitate acidic digestive juice at attacking enemy many papilionid larva produce bad smell from extrudable gland called osmeteria defensive behavior many caterpillar display feeding behavior which allow the caterpillar to remain hidden from potential predator many feed in protected environment such a enclosed inside silk gallery rolled leaf or by mining between the leaf surface some caterpillar like early instar of the tomato hornworm and tobacco hornworm have long organ attached to the end of their body the caterpillar wiggle these organ to frighten away fly and predatory wasp some caterpillar can evade predator by using a silk line and dropping off from branch when disturbed many specie thrash about violently when disturbed to scare away potential predator one specie amorpha juglandis even make high pitched whistle that can scare away bird social behavior and relationship with other insect some caterpillar obtain protection by associating themselves with ant the lycaenid butterfly are particularly well known for this they communicate with their ant protector by vibration a well a chemical mean and typically provide food rewardssome caterpillar are gregarious large aggregation are believed to help in reducing the level of parasitization and predation cluster amplify the signal of aposematic coloration and individual may participate in group regurgitation or display pine processionary thaumetopoea pityocampa caterpillar often link into a long train to move through tree and over the ground the head of the lead caterpillar is visible but the other head can appear hidden forest tent caterpillar cluster during period of cold weather predator caterpillar suffer predation from many animal the european pied flycatcher is one specie that prey upon caterpillar the flycatcher typically find caterpillar among oak foliage paper wasp including those in the genus polistes and polybia catch caterpillar to feed their young and themselves behavior caterpillar have been called eating machine and eat leaf voraciously most specie shed their skin four or five time a their body grow and they eventually enter a pupal stage before becoming adult caterpillar grow very quickly for instance a tobacco hornworm will increase it weight in le than twenty day an adaptation that enables them to eat so much is a mechanism in a specialized midgut that quickly transport ion to the lumen midgut cavity to keep the potassium level higher in the midgut cavity than in the hemolymph most caterpillar are solely herbivorous many are restricted to feeding on one specie of plant while others are polyphagous some including the clothes moth feed on detritus some are predatory and may prey on other specie of caterpillar eg hawaiian eupithecia others feed on egg of other insect aphid scale insect or ant larva a few are parasitic on cicada or leaf hopper epipyropidae some hawaiian caterpillar hyposmocoma molluscivora use silk trap to capture snailsmany caterpillar are nocturnal for example the cutworm of the family noctuidae hide at the base of plant during the day and only feed at night others such a gypsy moth lymantria dispar larva change their activity pattern depending on density and larval stage with more diurnal feeding in early instar and high density economic effect caterpillar cause much damage mainly by eating leaf the propensity for damage is enhanced by monocultural farming practice especially where the caterpillar is specifically adapted to the host plant under cultivation the cotton bollworm cause enormous loss other specie eat food crop caterpillar have been the target of pest control through the use of pesticide biological control and agronomic practice many specie have become resistant to pesticide bacterial toxin such a those from bacillus thuringiensis which are evolved to affect the gut of lepidoptera have been used in spray of bacterial spore toxin extract and also by incorporating gene to produce them within the host plant these approach are defeated over time by the evolution of resistance mechanism in the insectsplants evolve mechanism of resistance to being eaten by caterpillar including the evolution of chemical toxin and physical barrier such a hair incorporating host plant resistance hpr through plant breeding is another approach used in reducing the impact of caterpillar on crop plantssome caterpillar are used in industry the silk industry is based on the silkworm caterpillar human health caterpillar hair can be a cause of human health problem caterpillar hair sometimes have venom in them and specie from approximately family of moth or butterfly worldwide can inflict serious human injury ranging from urticarial dermatitis and atopic asthma to osteochondritis consumption coagulopathy kidney failure and brain bleeding skin rash are the most common but there have been fatality lonomia is a frequent cause of envenomation in brazil with case reported between and lethality ranging up to with death caused most often by intracranial hemorrhagecaterpillar hair ha also been known to cause the sharp barb on the end of caterpillar hair can get lodged in soft tissue and mucous membrane such a the eye once they enter such tissue they can be difficult to extract often exacerbating the problem a they migrate across the membranethis becomes a particular problem in an indoor setting the hair easily enter building through ventilation system and accumulate in indoor environment because of their small size which make it difficult for them to be vented out this accumulation increase the risk of human contact in indoor environmentscaterpillars are a food source in some culture for example in south africa mopane worm are eaten by the bushman and in china silkworm are considered a delicacy in popular culture in the old testament of the bible caterpillar are feared a pest that devour crop they are part of the pestilence blasting mildew locust because of their association with the locust thus they are one of the plague of egypt jeremiah name them a one of the inhabitant of babylon the english word caterpillar derives from the old french catepelose hairy cat but merged with the piller pillager caterpillar became a symbol for social dependent shakespeare bolingbroke described king richard friend a the caterpillar of the commonwealth which i have sworn to weed and pluck away in william blake referenced this popular image in the marriage of heaven and hell when he attacked priest a the caterpillar chooses the fairest leaf to lay her egg on so the priest lay his curse on the fairest joy the role of caterpillar in the life stage of butterfly wa badly understood in maria sibylla merian published the first volume of the caterpillar marvelous transformation and strange floral food which contained illustration and a description of insect moth butterfly and their larva an earlier popular publication on moth and butterfly and their caterpillar by jan goedart had not included egg in the life stage of european moth and butterfly because he had believed that caterpillar were generated from water when merian published her study of caterpillar it wa still widely believed that insect were spontaneously generated merian illustration supported the finding of francesco redi marcello malpighi and jan swammerdambutterflies were regarded a symbol for the human soul since ancient time and also in the christian tradition goedart thus located his empirical observation on the transformation of caterpillar into butterfly in the christian tradition a such he argued that the metamorphosis from caterpillar into butterfly wa a symbol and even proof of christ resurrection he argued that from dead caterpillar emerge living animal so it is equally true and miraculous that our dead and rotten corps will rise from the grave swammerdam who in had demonstrated that inside a caterpillar the rudiment of the future butterfly limb and wing could be discerned attacked the mystical and religious notion that the caterpillar died and the butterfly subsequently resurrected a a militant cartesian swammerdam attacked goedart a ridiculous and when publishing his finding he proclaimed here we witness the digression of those who have tried to prove resurrection of the dead from these obviously natural and comprehensible change within the creature itself since then the metamorphosis of the caterpillar into a butterfly ha in western society been associated with countless human transformation in folktale and literature there is no process in the physical life of human being that resembles this metamorphosis and the symbol of the caterpillar tends to depict a psychic transformation of a human a such the caterpillar ha in the christian tradition become a metaphor for being born again famously in lewis carroll alice adventure in wonderland a caterpillar asks alice who are you when alice comment on the caterpillar inevitable transformation into a butterfly the caterpillar champion the position that in spite of change it is still possible to know something and that alice is the same alice at the beginning and end of a considerable interval when the caterpillar asks alice to clarify a point the child reply i afraid i ca put it more clearly for i ca but understand it myself to begin with and being so many different size in a day is very confusing here carroll satirizes rene descartes the founder of cartesian philosophy and his theory on innate idea descartes argued that we are distracted by urgent bodily stimulus that swamp the human mind in childhood descartes also theorised that inherited preconceived opinion obstruct the human perception of the truthmore recent symbolic reference to caterpillar in popular medium include the mad men season episode the fog in which betty draper ha a dream while in labor that she capture a caterpillar and hold it firmly in her hand in the soprano season episode the test dream tony soprano dream that ralph cifaretto ha a caterpillar on his bald head that change into a butterfly gallery click left or right for a slide show see also edible caterpillar larval food plant of lepidoptera lepidopterism
