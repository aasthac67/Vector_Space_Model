grouse are a group of bird from the order galliformes in the family phasianidae grouse are frequently assigned to the subfamily tetraoninae sometimes tetraonidae a classification supported by mitochondrial dna sequence study and applied by the american ornithologist union itis and others grouse inhabit temperate and subarctic region of the northern hemisphere from pine forest to moorland and mountainside from rock ptarmigan in northern greenland to attwater prairie chicken in texas description grouse are heavily built like other galliformes such a chicken they range in length from to cm to in and in weight from to kg to lb male are larger than a heavy in the western capercaillie the largest member of the family grouse have feathered nostril their leg covered in feather down to the toe and in winter the toe too have feather or small scale on the side an adaptation for walking on snow and burrowing into it for shelter unlike other galliformes they have no spur feeding and habit these bird feed mainly on catkin leaf and typically account for over of adult food by weight thus their diet vary greatly with the season hatchling eat mostly insect and other invertebrate gradually reducing their proportion of animal food to adult level several of the specie are notable for eating large quantity of conifer needle which most other vertebrate refuse to digest vegetable food grouse have big crop and gizzard eat grit to break up food and have long intestine with caecum in which symbiotic bacteria digest celluloseforest specie flock only in autumn and winter though individual tolerate each other when they meet prairie specie are more social and tundra specie ptarmigan lagopus are the most social forming flock of up to in winter all grouse spend most of their time on the ground though when alarmed they may take off in a flurry and go into a long glidemost specie stay within their breeding range all year but make short seasonal movement many individual of the ptarmigan called rock ptarmigan in the u and willow grouse called willow ptarmigan in the u migrate hundred of kilometer reproduction in all but one specie the willow ptarmigan male are polygamous many specie have elaborate courtship display on the ground at dawn and dusk which in some are given in lek the display feature male brightly colored comb and in some specie brightly colored inflatable sac on the side of their neck the male display their plumage give vocalization that vary widely between specie and may engage in other activity such a drumming or fluttering their wing rattling their tail and making display flight occasionally male fightthe nest is a shallow depression or scrape on the in a scanty lining of plant material the female lay one clutch but may replace it if the egg are lost she begin to lay about a week after mating and lay one egg every day or two the clutch comprises five to egg the egg have the shape of hen egg and are pale yellow sparsely spotted with brown on laying the or last egg the female start to day of incubation chick hatch in dense down and leave the nest immediately they soon develop feather and can fly shortly before they are two week old the female and the male in the willow grouse stay with them and protects them until their first autumn when they reach their mature weight except in the male capercaillie they are sexually mature the following spring but often do not mate until later year population grouse make up a considerable part of the vertebrate biomass in the arctic and subarctic their number may fall sharply in year of bad weather or high predator grouse population are a major food source for lynx fox marten and bird of prey however because of their large clutch they can recover quickly the three tundra specie have maintained their former number the prairie and forest specie have declined greatly because of habitat loss though popular game bird such a the red grouse and the ruffed grouse have benefited from habitat management most grouse specie are listed by the iucn a least concern or near threatened but the greater and lesser prairie chicken are listed a vulnerable and the gunnison grouse is listed a endangered some subspecies such a attwater prairie chicken and the cantabrian capercaillie and some national and regional population are also in danger sexual size dimorphism male size selection the phenotypic difference between male and female is called sexual dimorphism male grouse tend to be larger than female grouse which seems to hold true across all the specie of grouse with some difference within each specie in term of how drastic the size difference is the hypothesis with the most supporting evidence for the evolution of sexual dimorphism in grouse is sexual selection sexual selection favor large male stronger selection for larger size in male lead to greater size dimorphism female size will increase correspondingly a male size increase and this is due to heredity but not to the extent of the male size this is because female that are smaller will still be able to reproduce without a substantial disadvantage but this is not the case with male the largest among the male grouse commonly dubbed attract the greatest number of female during their mating season mating behavior selection male grouse display lekking behavior which is when many male come together in one area and put on display to attract female female selectively choose among the male present for trait they find more appealing male grouse exhibit two type typical lekking and exploded lekking in typical lekking male display in small area and in exploded lekking display are done in area that do not have many resource for female male grouse can also compete with one another for access to female grouse through territoriality in which a male defends a territory which ha resource that female need like food and nest site these difference in male behavior in mating system account for the evolution of body size in grouse male of territorial specie were smaller than those of exploded lekking specie and male of typical lekking specie were the largest overall the male bird that exhibit lekking behavior and have to compete with other male for female to choose them have higher sexual size dimorphism this support the hypothesis of sexual selection affecting male body size and also give an explanation for why some specie of grouse have a more drastic difference between male and female body size than others contrast with other bird specie sexual size dimorphism can manifest itself differently between grouse and other bird in some case the female is dominant over the male in breeding behavior which can result in female that are larger than the male in culture grouse are game and hunter kill million each year for food sport and other us in the united kingdom this take the form of driven grouse shooting the male black grouse tail feather are a traditional ornament for hat in area such a scotland and the alp folk dance from the alp to the north american prairie imitate the display of lekking male specie reference footnote general de juana e family tetraonidae grouse in del
