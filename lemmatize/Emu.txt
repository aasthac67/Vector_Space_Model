the emu dromaius novaehollandiae is the living bird by height after it ratite relative the ostrich it is endemic to australia where it is the largest native bird and the only extant member of the genus dromaius the emu range cover most of mainland australia but the tasmanian kangaroo island and king island subspecies became extinct after the european settlement of australia in the bird is sufficiently common for it to be rated a a specie by the international union for conservation of nature emu are brown flightless bird with long neck and leg and can reach up to metre ft in height emu can travel great distance and when necessary can sprint at mph they forage for a variety of plant and insect but have been known to go for week without eating they drink infrequently but take in copious amount of water when the opportunity arises breeding take place in may and june and fighting among female for a mate is common female can mate several time and lay several clutch of egg in one season the male doe the incubation during this process he hardly eats or drink and loses a significant amount of weight the egg hatch after around eight week and the young are nurtured by their father they reach full size after around six month but can remain a a family unit until the next breeding season the emu is an important cultural icon of australia appearing on the coat of arm and various coin the bird feature prominently in indigenous australian mythology taxonomy history emu were first reported a having been seen by european when explorer visited the western coast of australia in this wa during an expedition led by dutch captain willem de vlamingh who wa searching for survivor of a ship that had gone missing two year earlier the bird were known on the eastern coast before when the first european settled there the bird were first mentioned under the name of the new holland cassowary in arthur phillip voyage to botany bay published in with the following description this is a specie differing in many particular from that generally known and is a much larger bird standing higher on it leg and having the neck longer than in the common one total length seven foot two inch the bill is not greatly different from that of the common cassowary but the horny appendage or helmet on top of the head in this specie is totally wanting the whole of the head and neck is also covered with feather except the throat and fore part of the neck about half way which are not so well feathered a the rest whereas in the common cassowary the head and neck are bare and carunculated a in the turkey the plumage in general consists of a mixture of brown and grey and the feather are somewhat curled or bent at the end in the natural state the wing are so very short a to be totally useless for flight and indeed are scarcely to be distinguished from the rest of the plumage were it not for their standing out a little the long spine which are seen in the wing of the common sort are in this not observable is there any appearance of a tail the leg are stout formed much a in the galeated cassowary with the addition of their being jagged or sawed the whole of their length at the back part the specie wa named by ornithologist john latham in based on a specimen from the sydney area of australia a country which wa known a new holland at the time he collaborated on phillip book and provided the first description of and name for many australian bird specie dromaius come from a greek word meaning racer and novaehollandiae is the latin term for new holland so the name can be rendered a new hollander in his original description of the emu the french ornithologist louis jean pierre vieillot used two generic name first dromiceius and later dromaius it ha been a point of contention ever since a to which name should be used the latter is more correctly formed but the convention in taxonomy is that the first name given to an organism stand unless it is clearly a typographical error most modern publication including those of the australian government use dromaius with dromiceius mentioned a an alternative spelling systematics the emu wa long classified with it closest relative the cassowary in the family casuariidae part of the ratite order struthioniformes however an alternate classification wa proposed in by mitchell et al based on analysis of mitochondrial dna this split off the casuariidae into their own order the casuariformes and includes only the cassowary in the family casuariidae placing the emu in their own family dromaiidae the cladogram shown below is from their study two different dromaius specie were present in australia at the time of european settlement and one additional specie is known from fossil remains the insular dwarf emu d n baudinianus and d n minor originally present on kangaroo island and king island respectively both became extinct shortly after the arrival of european d n diemenensis another insular dwarf emu from tasmania became extinct around however the mainland subspecies d n novaehollandiae remains common the population of these bird varies from decade to decade largely being dependent on rainfall in it wa estimated that there were between and bird emu were introduced to maria island off tasmania and kangaroo island off the coast of south australia during the century the maria island population died out in the the kangaroo island bird have successfully established a breeding populationin the australian ornithologist gregory m mathews recognised three living subspecies of emu d n novaehollandiae latham d n woodwardi mathews and d n rothschildi mathews however the handbook of the bird of the world argues that the last two of these subspecies are invalid natural variation in plumage colour and the nomadic nature of the specie make it likely that there is a single race in mainland australia examination of the dna of the king island emu show this bird to be closely related to the mainland emu and hence best treated a a subspecies common name the etymology of the common name emu is uncertain but is thought to have come from an arabic word for large bird that wa later used by portuguese explorer to describe the related cassowary in australia and new guinea another theory is that it come from the word ema which is used in portuguese to denote a large bird akin to an ostrich or crane in victoria some term for the emu were barrimal in the dja dja wurrung language myoure in gunai and courn in jardwadjali the bird were known a murawung or birabayin to the local eora and darug inhabitant of the sydney basin description the emu is the second tallest bird in the world only being exceeded in height by the ostrich the largest individual can reach up to to cm to in in height measured from the bill to the tail emu range in length from to cm to in with male averaging cm in and female averaging cm in emu are the fourth or fifth heaviest living bird after the two specie of ostrich and two larger specie of cassowary weighing slightly more on average than an emperor penguin adult emu weigh between and kg and lb with an average of and kg and lb in male and female respectively female are usually slightly larger than male and are substantially wider across the rump although flightless emu have vestigial wing the wing chord measuring around cm in and each wing having a small claw at the tip emu flap their wing when running perhaps a a mean of stabilising themselves when moving fast they have long neck and leg and can run at speed of mph due to their highly specialised pelvic limb musculature their foot have only three toe and a similarly reduced number of bone and associated foot muscle emu are unique among bird in that their gastrocnemius muscle in the back of the lower leg have four belly instead of the usual three the pelvic limb muscle of emu contribute a similar proportion of the total body mass a do the flight muscle of flying bird when walking the emu take stride of about cm ft but at full gallop a stride can be a long a cm ft it leg are devoid of feather and underneath it foot are thick cushioned pad like the cassowary the emu ha sharp claw on it toe which are it major defensive attribute and are used in combat to inflict wound on opponent by kicking the toe and claw total cm in in length the bill is quite small measuring to cm to in and is soft being adapted for grazing emu have good eyesight and hearing which allows them to detect threat at some distance the neck of the emu is pale blue and show through it sparse feather they have plumage of shaggy appearance the shaft and the tip of the feather are black solar radiation is absorbed by the tip and the inner plumage insulates the skin this prevents the bird from overheating allowing them to be active during the heat of the day a unique feature of the emu feather is the double rachis emerging from a single shaft both of the rachis have the same length and the texture is variable the area near the skin is rather furry but the more distant end resemble grass the sex are similar in appearance although the male penis can become visible when he urinates and defecates the plumage varies in colour due to environmental factor giving the bird a natural camouflage feather of emu in more arid area with red soil have a rufous tint while bird residing in damp condition are generally darker in hue the juvenile plumage develops at about three month and is blackish finely barred with brown with the head and neck being especially dark the facial feather gradually thin to expose the bluish skin the adult plumage ha developed by about fifteen monthsthe eye of an emu are protected by nictitating membrane these are translucent secondary eyelid that move horizontally from the inside edge of the eye to the outside edge they function a visor to protect the eye from the dust that is prevalent in windy arid region emu have a tracheal pouch which becomes more prominent during the mating season at more than cm in in length it is quite spacious it ha a thin wall and an opening centimetre in long distribution and habitat once common on the east coast of australia emu are now uncommon there by contrast the development of agriculture and the provision of water for stock in the interior of the continent have increased the range of the emu in arid region emu live in various habitat across australia both inland and near the coast they are most common in area of savannah woodland and sclerophyll forest and least common in heavily populated district and arid area with annual precipitation of le than millimetre in emu predominately travel in pair and while they can form large flock this is an atypical social behaviour that arises from the common need to move towards a new food source emu have been shown to travel long distance to reach abundant feeding area in western australia emu movement follow a distinct seasonal pattern north in summer and south in winter on the east coast their wandering seem to be more random and do not appear to follow a set pattern behaviour and ecology emu are diurnal bird and spend their day foraging preening their plumage with their beak dust bathing and resting they are generally gregarious bird apart from the breeding season and while some forage others remain vigilant to their mutual benefit they are able to swim when necessary although they rarely do so unless the area is flooded or they need to cross a river emu begin to settle down at sunset and sleep during the night they do not sleep continuously but rouse themselves several time during the night when falling asleep emu first squat on their tarsus and enter a drowsy state during which they are alert enough to react to stimulus and quickly return to a fully awakened state if disturbed a they fall into deeper sleep their neck droop closer to the body and the eyelid begin to close if there are no disturbance they fall into a deeper sleep after about twenty minute during this phase the body is gradually lowered until it is touching the ground with the leg folded underneath the beak is turned down so that the whole neck becomes and folded onto itself the feather direct any rain downwards onto the ground it ha been suggested that the sleeping position is a type of camouflage mimicking a small mound emu typically awake from deep sleep once every ninety minute or so and stand upright to feed briefly or defecate this period of wakefulness last for ten to twenty minute after which they return to slumber overall an emu sleep for around seven hour in each period young emu usually sleep with their neck flat and stretched forward along the ground surface the vocalisation of emu mostly consist of various booming and grunting sound the booming is created by the inflatable throat pouch the pitch can be regulated by the bird and depends on the size of the aperture most of the booming is done by female it is part of the courtship ritual is used to announce the holding of territory and is issued a a threat to rival a boom is audible kilometre mi away while a low more resonant call produced during the breeding season may at first attract mate and peak while the male is incubating the egg most of the grunting is done by male it is used principally during the breeding season in territorial defence a a threat to other male during courtship and while the female is laying both sex sometimes boom or grunt during threat display or on encountering strange objectson very hot day emu pant to maintain their body temperature their lung work a evaporative cooler and unlike some other specie the resulting low level of carbon dioxide in the blood do not appear to cause alkalosis for normal breathing in cooler weather they have large multifolded nasal passage cool air warms a it pass through into the lung extracting heat from the nasal region on exhalation the emu cold nasal turbinate condense moisture back out of the air and absorb it for reuse a with other ratite the emu ha great homeothermic ability and can maintain this status from to to the thermoneutral zone of emu lie between and and a with other ratite emu have a relatively low basal metabolic rate compared to other type of bird at the metabolic rate of an emu sitting down is about of that when standing partly because the lack of feather under the stomach lead to a higher rate of heat loss when standing from the exposed underbelly diet emu forage in a diurnal pattern and eat a variety of native and introduced plant specie the diet depends on seasonal availability with such plant a acacia casuarina and grass being favoured they also eat insect and other arthropod including grasshopper and cricket beetle cockroach ladybird bogong and moth larva ant spider and millipede this provides a large part of their protein requirement in western australia food preference have been observed in travelling emu they eat seed from acacia aneura until the rain arrive after which they move on to fresh grass shoot and caterpillar in winter they feed on the leaf and pod of cassia and in spring they consume grasshopper and the fruit of santalum acuminatum a sort of quandong they are also known to feed on wheat and any fruit or other crop that they can access easily climbing over high fence if necessary emu serve a an important agent for the dispersal of large viable seed which contributes to floral biodiversity one undesirable effect of this occurred in queensland in the early twentieth century when emu fed on the fruit of prickly pear in the outback they defecated the seed in various place a they moved around and this led to a series of campaign to hunt emu and prevent the seed of the invasive cactus being spread the cactus were eventually controlled by an introduced moth cactoblastis cactorum whose larva fed on the plant one of the earliest example of biological controlsmall stone are swallowed to assist in the grinding up and digestion of the plant material individual stone may weigh g oz and the bird may have a much a g lb in their gizzard at one time they also eat charcoal although the reason for this is unclear captive emu have been known to eat shard of glass marble car key jewellery and nut and boltsemus drink infrequently but ingest large amount when the opportunity arises they typically drink once a day first inspecting the water body and surrounding area in group before kneeling down at the edge to drink they prefer being on firm ground while drinking rather than on rock or mud but if they sense danger they often stand rather than kneel if not disturbed they may drink continuously for ten minute due to the scarcity of water source emu are sometimes forced to go without water for several day in the wild they often share water hole with kangaroo other bird and animal they are wary and tend to wait for the other animal to leave before drinking breeding emu form breeding pair during the summer month of december and january and may remain together for about five month during this time they stay in an area a few kilometre in diameter and it is believed they find and defend territory within this area both male and female put on weight during the breeding season with the female becoming slightly heavier at between and kg and lb mating usually take place between april and june the exact timing is determined by the climate a the bird nest during the coolest part of the year during the breeding season male experience hormonal change including an increase in luteinising hormone and testosterone level and their testicle double in sizemales construct a rough nest in a hollow on the ground using bark grass stick and leaf to line it the nest is almost always a flat surface rather than a segment of a sphere although in cold condition the nest is taller up to cm in tall and more spherical to provide some extra heat retention when other material is lacking the bird sometimes us a spinifex tussock a metre or so across despite the prickly nature of the foliage the nest can be placed on open ground or near a shrub or rock the nest is usually placed in an area where the emu ha a clear view of it surroundings and can detect approaching predatorsfemale emu court the male the female plumage darkens slightly and the small patch of bare featherless skin just below the eye and near the beak turn the colour of the male plumage remains unchanged although the bare patch of skin also turn light blue when courting female stride around pulling their neck back while puffing out their feather and emitting low monosyllabic call that have been compared to drum beat this calling can occur when male are out of sight or more than metre ft away once the male attention ha been gained the female circle her prospective mate at a distance of to metre to ft a she doe this she look at him by turning her neck while at the same time keeping her rump facing towards him if the male show interest in the parading female he will move closer the female continues the courtship by shuffling further away but continuing to circle himif a male is interested he will stretch his neck and erect his feather then bend over and peck at the ground he will circle around and sidle up to the female swaying his body and neck from side to side and rubbing his breast against his partner rump often the female will reject his advance with aggression but if amenable she signal acceptance by squatting down and raising her rump female are more aggressive than male during the courtship period often fighting for access to mate with fight among female accounting for more than half the aggressive interaction during this period if female court a male that already ha a partner the incumbent female will try to repel the competitor usually by chasing and kicking these interaction can be prolonged lasting up to five hour especially when the male being fought over is single and neither female ha the advantage of incumbency in these case the female typically intensify their call and displaysthe sperm from a mating is stored by the female and can suffice to fertilise about six egg the pair mate every day or two and every second or third day the female lay one of a clutch of five to fifteen very large green egg the shell is around mm in thick but rather thinner in northern region according to indigenous australian the egg are on average cm cm in in and weigh between and g and lb the maternal investment in the egg is considerable and the proportion of yolk to albumen at about is greater than would be predicted for a precocial egg of this size this probably relates to the long incubation period which mean the developing chick must consume greater resource before hatching the first verified occurrence of genetically identical avian twin wa demonstrated in the emu the egg surface is granulated and pale green during the incubation period the egg turn dark green although if the egg never hatch it will turn white from the bleaching effect of the sun the male becomes broody after his mate start laying and may begin to incubate the egg before the clutch is complete from this time on he doe not eat drink or defecate and stand only to turn the egg which he doe about ten time a day he develops a brood patch a bare area of wrinkled skin which is in intimate contact with the egg over the course of the incubation period he will lose a third of his weight and will survive on stored body fat and on any morning dew that he can reach from the nest a with many other australian bird such a the superb fairywren infidelity is the norm for emu despite the initial pair bond once the male start brooding the female usually wanders off and may mate with other male and lay in multiple nest thus a many a half the chick in a brood may not be fathered by the incubating male or even by either parent a emu also exhibit brood parasitism some female stay and defend the nest until the chick start hatching but most leave the nesting area completely to nest again in a good season a female emu may nest three time if the parent stay together during the incubation period they will take turn standing guard over the egg while the other drink and feed within earshot if it perceives a threat during this period it will lie down on top of the nest and try to blend in with the surround and suddenly stand up to confront and scare the other party if it come closeincubation take day and the male stop incubating the egg shortly before they hatch the temperature of the nest rise slightly during the period although the egg are laid sequentially they tend to hatch within two day of one another a the egg that were laid later experienced higher temperature and developed more rapidly during the process the precocial emu chick need to develop a capacity for thermoregulation during incubation the embryo are kept at a constant temperature but the chick will need to be able to cope with varying external temperature by the time they hatchnewly hatched chick are active and can leave the nest within a few day of hatching they stand about cm in tall at first weigh kg oz and have distinctive brown and cream stripe for camouflage which fade after three month or so the male guard the growing chick for up to seven month teaching them how to find food chick grow very quickly and are fully grown in five to six month they may remain with their family group for another six month or so before they split up to breed in their second season during their early life the young emu are defended by their father who adopts a belligerent stance towards other emu including the mother he doe this by ruffling his feather emitting sharp grunt and kicking his leg to drive off other animal he can also bend his knee to crouch over smaller chick to protect them at night he envelops his young with his feather a the young emu can not travel far the parent must choose an area with plentiful food in which to breed in captivity emu can live for upwards of ten year predation there are few native natural predator of emu still alive early in it specie history it may have faced numerous terrestrial predator now extinct including the giant lizard megalania the thylacine and possibly other carnivorous marsupial which may explain their seemingly ability to defend themselves from terrestrial predator the main predator of emu today is the dingo which wa originally introduced by aboriginal thousand of year ago from a stock of wolf dingo try to kill the emu by attacking the head the emu typically try to repel the dingo by jumping into the air and kicking or stamping the dingo on it way down the emu jump a the dingo barely ha the capacity to jump high enough to threaten it neck so a correctly timed leap to coincide with the dingo lunge can keep it head and neck out of dangerdespite the potential relationship the presence of predaceous dingo doe not appear to heavily influence emu number with other natural condition just a likely to cause mortality eagle are the only avian predator capable of attacking emu though are perhaps most likely to take small or young specimen the eagle attack emu by swooping downwards rapidly and at high speed and aiming for the head and neck in this case the emu jumping technique a employed against the dingo is not useful the bird try to target the emu in open ground so that it can not hide behind obstacle under such circumstance the emu can only run in a chaotic manner and change direction frequently to try to evade it attacker other raptor monitor lizard introduced red fox feral and domestic dog and feral pig occasionally feed on emu egg or kill small chick parasite emu can suffer from both external and internal parasite but under farmed condition are more than ostrich or rhea external parasite include the louse dahlemhornia asymmetrica and various other louse tick mite and fly chick sometimes suffer from intestinal tract infection caused by coccidian protozoa and the nematode trichostrongylus tenuis infects the emu a well a a wide range of other bird causing haemorrhagic diarrhoea other nematode are found in the trachea and bronchus syngamus trachea causing haemorrhagic tracheitis and cyathostoma variegatum causing serious respiratory problem in juvenile relationship with human emu were used a a source of food by indigenous australian and early european settler emu are inquisitive bird and have been known to approach human if they see unexpected movement of a limb or piece of clothing in the wild they may follow and observe people aboriginal australian used a variety of technique to catch the bird including spearing them while they drank at waterholes catching them in net and attracting them by imitating their call or by arousing their curiosity with a ball of feather and rag dangled from a tree the pitchuri thornapple duboisia hopwoodii or some similar poisonous plant could be used to contaminate a waterhole after which the disoriented emu were easy to catch another stratagem wa for the hunter to use a skin a a disguise and the bird could be lured into a camouflaged pit trap using rag or imitation call aboriginal australian only killed emu out of necessity and frowned on anyone who hunted them for any other reason every part of the carcass had some use the fat wa harvested for it valuable oil the bone were shaped into knife and tool the feather were used for body adornment and the tendon substituted for stringthe early european settler killed emu to provide food and used their fat for fuelling lamp they also tried to prevent them from interfering with farming or invading settlement in search of water during drought an extreme example of this wa the emu war in western australia in emu flocked to the chandler and walgoolan area during a dry spell damaging rabbit fencing and devastating crop an attempt to drive them off wa mounted with the army called in to dispatch them with machine gun the emu largely avoided the hunter and won the battle emu are large powerful bird and their leg are among the strongest of any animal and powerful enough to tear down metal fencing the bird are very defensive of their young and there have been two documented case of human being attacked by emu economic value in the area in which it wa endemic the emu wa an important source of meat to aboriginal australian they used the fat a bush medicine and rubbed it into their skin it served a a valuable lubricant wa used to oil wooden tool and utensil such a the coolamon and wa mixed with ochre to make the traditional paint for ceremonial body adornment their egg were also foraged for foodan example of how the emu wa cooked come from the arrernte of central australia who called it kere ankerre emu are around all the time in green time and dry time you pluck the feather out first then pull out the crop from the stomach and put in the feather you pulled out and then singe it on the fire you wrap the milk gut that you pulled out into something such a gum leaf and cook them when you got the fat off you cut the meat up and cook it on fire made from river red gum wood the bird were a food and fuel source for early european settler and are now farmed in australia and elsewhere for their meat oil and leather commercial emu farming started in western australia around the commercial industry in the country is based on stock bred in captivity and all state except tasmania have licensing requirement to protect wild emu outside australia emu are farmed on a large scale in north america with about million bird in the u peru and china and to a lesser extent in some other country emu breed well in captivity and are kept in large open pen to avoid the leg and digestive problem that arise from inactivity they are typically fed on grain supplemented by grazing and are slaughtered at to monthsthe salem district administration in india advised farmer in not to invest in the emu business which wa being heavily promoted at the time further investigation wa needed to ass the profitability of farming the bird in india in the united state it wa reported in that many rancher had left the emu business it wa estimated that the number of grower had dropped from over five thousand in to one or two thousand in the remaining grower increasingly rely on sale of oil for their profit although leather egg and meat are also sold emu are farmed primarily for their meat leather feather and oil and of the carcass can be used emu meat is a product le than fat and is comparable to other lean meat most of the usable portion the best cut come from the thigh and the larger muscle of the drum or lower leg are like other poultry dark meat emu meat is considered for cooking purpose by the u food and drug administration to be a red meat because it red colour and ph value approximate that of beef but for inspection purpose it is considered to be poultry emu fat is rendered to produce oil for cosmetic dietary supplement and therapeutic product the oil is obtained from the subcutaneous and retroperitoneal fat the macerated adipose tissue is heated and the liquefied fat is filtered to get a clear oil this consists mainly of fatty acid of which oleic acid linoleic and palmitic acid each are the most prominent component it also contains various notably carotenoid and flavonesthere is some evidence that the oil ha property however there have not yet been extensive test and the usda regard pure emu oil a an unapproved drug and highlighted it in a article entitled how to spot health fraud nevertheless the oil ha been linked to the easing of gastrointestinal inflammation and test on rat have shown that it ha a significant effect in treating arthritis and joint pain more so than olive or fish oil it ha been scientifically shown to improve the rate of wound healing but the mechanism responsible for this effect is not understood a study ha claimed that emu oil ha a better and potential than ostrich oil and linked this to emu oil higher proportion of unsaturated to saturated fatty acid while there are no scientific study showing that emu oil is effective in human it is marketed and promoted a a dietary supplement with a wide variety of claimed health benefit commercially marketed emu oil supplement are poorly standardisedemu leather ha a distinctive patterned surface due to a raised area around the feather follicle in the skin the leather is used in such item a wallet handbag shoe and clothes often in combination with other leather the feather and egg are used in decorative art and craft in particular emptied emu egg have been engraved with portrait similar to cameo and scene of australian native animal mounted emu egg and container in the form of hundred of goblet inkstand and vas were produced in the second half of the nineteenth century all richly embellished with image of australian flora fauna and indigenous people by travelling silversmith founder of a australian grammar of ornament they continued longstanding tradition that can be traced back to the european mounted ostrich egg of the thirteenth century and christian symbolism and notion of virginity fertility faith and strength for a society of proud settler who sought to bring culture and civilisation to their new world the traditional goblet freed from it root in a society dominated by court culture wa creatively made novel in the australian colony a form and function were invented to make the object attractive to a new broader audience significant designer adolphus blau julius hogarth ernest leviny julius schomburgk johann heinrich steiner christian quist joachim matthias wendt william edward and others had the technical training on which to build flourishing business in a country rich in raw material and a clientele hungry for paraphernalia cultural reference the emu ha a prominent place in australian aboriginal mythology including a creation myth of the yuwaalaraay and other group in new south wale who say that the sun wa made by throwing an emu egg into the sky the bird feature in numerous aetiological story told across a number of aboriginal group one story from western australia hold that a man once annoyed a small bird who responded by throwing a boomerang severing the arm of the man and transforming him into a flightless emu the kurdaitcha man of central australia is said to wear sandal made of emu feather to mask his footprint many aboriginal language group throughout australia have a tradition that the dark dust lane in the milky way represent a giant emu in the sky several of the sydney rock engraving depict emu and the bird are mimicked in indigenous dancesthe emu is popularly but unofficially considered a a faunal emblem the national bird of australia it appears a a shield bearer on the coat of arm of australia with the red kangaroo and a a part of the arm also appears on the australian coin it ha featured on numerous australian postage stamp including a new south wale anniversary issue from which featured a penny blue emu stamp a stamp released in and a stamp released in the hat of the australian light horse are decorated with emu feather plumestrademarks of early australian company using the emu included webbenderfer bros frame moulding mac

six hundred gazetted place in australia with emu in their title including mountain lake hill plain creek and waterholes during the and century many australian company and household product were named after the bird in western australia emu beer ha been produced since the early century and the swan brewery continues to produce a range of beer branded a emu the quarterly journal of the royal australasian ornithologist union also known a bird australia is entitled emu austral ornithologythe comedian rod hull featured a wayward emu puppet in his act for many year and the bird returned to the small screen in the hand of his son after the puppeteer death in american insurance company liberty mutual launched an advertising campaign that feature limu emu a emu status and conservation in john gould handbook to the bird of australia first published in he lamented the loss of the emu from tasmania where it had become rare and ha since become extinct he noted that emu were no longer common in the vicinity of sydney and proposed that the specie be given protected status in the emu killing in western australia peaked at and cull were also mounted in queensland during this period due to rampant crop damage in the bounty were still being paid in western australia for killing emu but since then wild emu have been granted formal protection under the environment protection and biodiversity conservation act their occurrence range is between and sq mi and a census suggested that their total population wa between and their population trend is thought to be stable and the international union for the conservation of nature ass their conservation status a being of least concern the isolated emu population of the new south wale north coast bioregion and port stephen is listed a endangered by the new south wale governmentalthough the population of emu on mainland australia is thought to be higher now than it wa before european settlement some local population are at risk of extinction the threat faced by emu include the clearance and fragmentation of area of suitable habitat deliberate slaughter collision with vehicle and predation of the egg and young see also
