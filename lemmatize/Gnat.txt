a gnat is any of many specie of tiny flying insect in the dipterid suborder nematocera especially those in the family mycetophilidae anisopodidae and sciaridae they can be both biting and most often they fly in large number called cloud gnat is a loose descriptive category rather than a phylogenetic or other technical term so there is no scientific consensus on what constitutes a gnat some entomologist consider only fly to be gnat certain university also distinguish eye gnat the smithsonian institution describes them a fly no bigger than a few grain of salt attracted to fluid secreted by your eye description male gnat often assemble in large mating swarm or ghost particularly at dusk gnat larva are mostly and some are aquatic many feed on plant though some are carnivorous larval plant feeder such a the hessian fly larva cause root stem or leaf gall to be formed by the host plant some specie of fungus gnat family mycetophilidae and sciaridae are pest of mushroom and root of potted plant in home and greenhouse black fly and biting midge also belonging to the gnat category are small sometimes barely visible fly commonly known in many area a biting gnat sand fly punky or some south american pleurothallid orchid are pollinated by tiny gnat and have correspondingly small flower life cycle gnat population abide near water including wet soil and are usually active in the summer however they can occur during any time of year in moist coastal region male gnat swarm at dusk the mating occurs a soon a the female enter the swarm the female lay egg en masse over water or attached to aquatic vegetation the hatching continues over several day with the young larva dropping to the bottom and building tubelike structure of debris larva are small creature that feed on organic material the larva stage continues for about a month after which the specie pupate for a few day before emerging the pupa rise to the surface of the water serving a a nutritious food for fish the pupal stage culminates in the metamorphosis of larva into winged adult which usually last le than seven day adult live for about another week and a half during which they produce up to egg one female gnat can lay up to egg during it lifetime control adult gnat do not damage plant and are considered a nuisance usually larva do not cause serious plant damage but when present in large number can stunt the plant growth and damage it root to prevent gnat from spreading measure have to be taken to target immature stage of development of the specie physical tactic include eliminating favorable living condition reduction of excess moisture drainage of pool with standing water and removal of decaying organic matter commercially available control agent and insecticide can be used a a control measure but are not recommended for use in a household to control adult gnat in smaller area pressurized aerosol spray with pyrethrins can be used other control measure in the household can include turning off unnecessary light at dusk and sealing vent and other opening see also black fly enicocephalidae gnat bug cecidomyiidae gall gnat sciaridae fungus gnat ceratopogonidae midge sandfly reference
