coat is uniformly reddish tan or sandy while the ventral part are lighter with small reddish marking it reach cm in at the shoulder and weighs kg lb it wa first scientifically described by german naturalist johann christian daniel von schreber in three subspecies are recognised typically nocturnal the caracal is highly secretive and difficult to observe it is territorial and life mainly alone or in pair the caracal is a carnivore that typically prey upon small mammal bird and rodent it can leap higher than metre ft and catch bird in midair it stalk it prey until it is within m ft of it after which it run it down and kill it prey with a bite to the throat or to the back of the neck both sex become sexually mature by the time they are one year old and breed throughout the year gestation last between two and three month resulting in a litter of one to six kitten juvenile leave their mother at the age of nine to ten month though a few female stay back with their mother the average lifespan of captive caracal is nearly year caracal were tamed and used for hunting in ancient egypt taxonomy and phylogeny felis caracal wa the scientific name used by johann christian daniel von schreber in who described a caracal skin from the cape of good hope in british zoologist john edward gray placed it in the genus caracal it is placed in the family felidae and subfamily felinaein the and century several caracal specimen were described and proposed a subspecies since three subspecies are recognised a valid southern caracal c c caracal schreber occurs in southern and east africa northern caracal c c nubicus fischer occurs in north and west africa asiatic caracal c c schmitzi matschie occurs in asia phylogeny result of a phylogenetic study indicates that the caracal and the african golden cat caracal aurata diverged between and million year ago these two specie together with the serval leptailurus serval form the caracal lineage which diverged between and million year ago the ancestor of this lineage arrived in africa between and million year agothe relationship of the caracal is considered a follows etymology the name wa proposed by george buffon in who referred to it turkish name or meaning with black ear the of the greek and roman wa most probably the caracal and the name is sometimes still applied to it but the lynx proper is a separate genusthe caracal is also known a desert lynx and persian lynx local name it name in the tigrinya language is cheke 'aanebasaa ch ok anbessa which mean lion characteristic the caracal is a slender moderately sized cat characterised by a robust build a short face long canine teeth tufted ear and long leg it reach nearly cm in at the shoulder the tan bushy tail extends to the hock the caracal is sexually dimorphic the female are smaller than the male in most bodily parametersthe prominent facial feature include the black tuft on the ear two black stripe from the forehead to the nose the black outline of the mouth the distinctive black facial marking and the white patch surrounding the eye and the mouth the eye appear to be narrowly open due to the lowered upper eyelid probably an adaptation to shield the eye from the sun glare the ear tuft may start drooping a the animal age the coat is uniformly reddish tan or sandy though black caracal are also known the underbelly and the inside of the leg are lighter often with small reddish marking the fur soft short and dense grows coarser in the summer the ground hair the basal layer of hair covering the coat are denser in winter than in summer the length of the guard hair the hair extending above the ground hair can be up to cm in long in winter but shorten to cm in in summer these feature indicate the onset of moulting in the hot season typically in october and november the hind leg are longer than the foreleg so the body appears to be sloping downward from the rumpmale caracal measure in length cm in and have cm in long tail male caracal ranged in weight between and kg and lb the length of female is cm in with a tail of cm in female ranged in weight between and kg and lb the caracal is often confused with the lynx a both cat have tufted ear however a notable point of difference between the two is that the lynx is spotted and blotched while the caracal show no such marking on the coat the african golden cat ha a similar build a the caracal but is darker and lack the ear tuft the sympatric serval can be distinguished from the caracal by the former lack of ear tuft white spot behind the ear spotted coat longer leg longer tail and smaller footprintsthe skull of the caracal is high and rounded featuring large auditory bulla a supraoccipital crest normal to the sagittal crest and a strong lower jaw the caracal ha a total of teeth the dental formula is the deciduous dentition is the striking canine are up to cm in long heavy and sharp these are used to give the killing bite to the prey the caracal lack the second upper premolar and the upper molar are diminutive the large paw similar to those of the cheetah consist of four digit in the hind leg and five in the fore leg the first digit of the fore leg remains above the ground and feature the dewclaw the claw sharp and retractable able to be drawn in are larger but le curved in the hind leg distribution and habitat in africa the caracal is widely distributed south of the sahara but considered rare in north africa in asia it occurs from the arabian peninsula middle east turkmenistan uzbekistan to western india it inhabits forest savanna marshy lowland semidesert and scrub forest but prefers dry area with low rainfall and availability of cover in montane habitat such a the ethiopian highland it occurs up to an altitude of m ft in ethiopia degua tembien massif they can be seen along road sometimes a road killsin the emirate of abu dhabi a male caracal wa recorded by in jebel hafeet national park in the region abu dhabi in february the first such record since uzbekistan caracal were recorded only in the desert region of the ustyurt plateau and kyzylkum desert between and individual were sighted alive and at least were killed by herdersin iran the caracal ha been recorded in abbasabad naein reserve bahram gur protected area kavir national park and in yazd provincein india the caracal occurs in sariska tiger reserve and ranthambhore tiger reserve ecology and behaviour the caracal is typically nocturnal active at night though some activity may be observed during the day a well however the cat is so secretive and difficult to observe that it activity at daytime might easily go unnoticed a study in south africa showed that caracal are most active when the air temperature drop below activity typically cease at higher temperature a solitary cat the caracal mainly occurs alone or in pair the only group seen are of mother with their offspring female in oestrus temporarily pair with male a territorial animal the caracal mark rock and vegetation in it territory with urine and probably with dung which is not covered with soil claw scratching is prominent and dung midden are typically not formed in israel male are found to have territory averaging sq mi while that of female averaged sq mi the male territory vary from sq mi in saudi arabia in mountain zebra national park the home range of female vary between and and sq mi these territory overlap extensively the conspicuous ear tuft and the facial marking often serve a a method of visual communication caracal have been observed interacting with each other by moving the head from side to side so that the tuft flicker rapidly like other cat the caracal meow growl hiss spit and purr diet and hunting a carnivore the caracal typically prey upon small mammal bird and rodent study in south africa have reported that it prey on the cape grysbok the common duiker sheep goat bush vlei rat rock hyrax hare and bird a study in western india showed that rodent comprise a significant portion of the diet they will feed from a variety of source but tend to focus on the most abundant one grass and grape are taken occasionally to clear their immune system and stomach of any parasite larger antelope such a young kudu bushbuck impala mountain reedbuck and springbok may also be targeted mammal generally comprise at least of the diet lizard snake and insect are infrequently eaten in south africa caracal have been documented preying on small livestock in area where sheep and goat are farmed livestock is however only a small and seasonal portion of their diet when wild prey is scarceits speed and agility make it an efficient hunter able to take down prey two to three time it size the powerful hind leg allow it to leap more than m ft in the air to catch bird on the wing it can even twist and change it direction it is an adroit climber it stalk it prey until it is within m ft following which it can launch into a sprint while large prey such a antelope are suffocated by a throat bite smaller prey are killed by a bite on the back of the neck kill are consumed immediately and le commonly dragged to cover it return to large kill if undisturbed it ha been observed to begin feeding on antelope kill at the hind part it may scavenge at time though this ha not been frequently observed it often ha to compete with fox wolf leopard and hyaena for prey reproduction both sex become sexually mature by the time they are a year old production of gamete begin even earlier at seven to ten month however successful mating take place only at to month breeding take place throughout the year oestrus one to three day long recurs every two week unless the female is pregnant female in oestrus show a spike in and form temporary pair with male mating ha not been extensively studied a limited number of observation suggest that copulation that last nearly four minute on an average begin with the male smelling the area by the female which roll on the ground following this he approach and mount the female the pair separate after copulationgestation last about two to three month following which a litter consisting of one to six kitten is born birth generally peak from october to february birth take place in dense vegetation or deserted burrow of aardvark and porcupine kitten are born with their eye and ear shut and the claw not retractable unable to be drawn inside the coat resembles that of adult but the abdomen is spotted eye open by ten day but it take longer for the vision to become normal the ear become erect and the claw become retractable by the third or the fourth week around the same time the kitten start roaming their birthplace and start playing among themselves by the fifth or the sixth week they begin taking solid food around the same time they have to wait for nearly three month before they make their first kill a the kitten start moving about by themselves the mother start shifting them every day all the milk teeth appear in day and permanent dentition is completed in month juvenile begin dispersing at nine to ten month though a few female stay back with their mother the average lifespan of the caracal in captivity is nearly yearsin the a captive caracal spontaneously mated with a domestic cat in the moscow zoo resulting in a felid hybrid offspring threat the caracal is listed a least concern on the iucn red list since a it is widely distributed in over range country where the threat to caracal population vary in extent habitat loss due to agricultural expansion the building of road and settlement is a major threat in all range country it is thought to be close to extinction in north africa critically endangered in pakistan endangered in jordan but stable in central and southern africa local people kill caracal to protect livestock or in retaliation for it preying on small livestock additionally it is threatened by hunting for the pet trade on the arabian peninsula in turkey and iran caracal are frequently killed in road accident in uzbekistan the major threat to caracal is killing by herder in retaliation for livestock loss guarding technique and shed are inadequate to protect small livestock like goat and sheep from being attacked by predator additionally similarly to ethiopia road crossing caracal habitat pose a potential threat for the specie conservation african caracal population are listed under cite appendix ii while asian population come under cite appendix i hunting of caracal is prohibited in afghanistan algeria egypt india iran israel jordan kazakhstan lebanon morocco pakistan syria tajikistan tunisia turkey turkmenistan and uzbekistan caracal occur in a number of protected area across their rangein south africa the caracal is considered least concern a it is widespread and adaptable to a variety of habitat it is tolerant to area although it ha been persecuted for many decade farmer are encouraged to report sighting of caracal both dead and alive a well a livestock killed by caracal to the national predation management information centrethe central asian caracal population is listed a critically endangered in uzbekistan since and in kazakhstan since in culture chinese emperor used caracal a gift in the and the century yuan dynasty ruler bought numerous caracal cheetah and tiger from muslim merchant in the western part of the empire in return for gold silver cash and silk according to the ming shilu the subsequent ming dynasty continued this practice until a recently a the century the caracal wa used in hunt by indian ruler to hunt small game while the cheetah wa used for larger game in those time caracal were exposed to a flock of pigeon and people would bet on which caracal would kill the largest number of pigeon this probably gave rise to the expression to put the cat among the pigeon the caracal appears to have been religiously significant in the ancient egyptian culture a it occurs in painting and a bronze figurine sculpture are thought to have guarded the tomb of pharaoh embalmed caracal have also been discovered it pelt wa used for making fur coat reference external link caracal iucn cat specialist
