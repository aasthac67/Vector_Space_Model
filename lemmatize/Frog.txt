a frog is any member of a diverse and largely carnivorous group of tailless amphibian composing the order anura literally without tail in ancient greek the oldest fossil appeared in the early triassic of madagascar but molecular clock dating suggests their origin may extend further back to the permian million year ago frog are widely distributed ranging from the tropic to subarctic region but the greatest concentration of specie diversity is in tropical rainforest there are over recorded specie accounting for around of extant amphibian specie they are also one of the five most diverse vertebrate order warty frog specie tend to be called toad but the distinction between frog and toad is informal not from taxonomy or evolutionary history all toad are frog but not all frog are toadsan adult frog ha a stout body protruding eye tongue limb folded underneath and no tail except in tailed frog frog have glandular skin with secretion ranging from distasteful to toxic their skin varies in colour from dappled brown grey and green to vivid pattern of bright red or yellow and black to show toxicity and ward off predator adult frog live in fresh water and on dry land some specie are adapted for living underground or in tree frog typically lay their egg in water the egg hatch into aquatic larva called tadpole that have tail and internal gill they have highly specialized rasping mouth part suitable for herbivorous omnivorous or planktivorous diet the life cycle is completed when they metamorphose into adult a few specie deposit egg on land or bypass the tadpole stage adult frog generally have a carnivorous diet consisting of small invertebrate but omnivorous specie exist and a few feed on plant matter frog skin ha a rich microbiome which is important to their health frog are extremely efficient at converting what they eat into body mass they are an important food source for predator and part of the food web dynamic of many of the world ecosystem the skin is making them susceptible to dehydration so they either live in moist place or have special adaptation to deal with dry habitat frog produce a wide range of vocalization particularly in their breeding season and exhibit many different kind of complex behaviour to attract mate to fend off predator and to generally survive frog are valued a food by human and also have many cultural role in literature symbolism and religion they are also seen a environmental bellwether with decline in frog population often viewed a early warning sign of environmental damage frog population have declined significantly since the more than one third of specie are considered to be threatened with extinction and over are believed to have become extinct since the the number of malformation among frog is on the rise and an emerging fungal disease chytridiomycosis ha spread around the world conservation biologist are working to understand the cause of these problem and to resolve them etymology and taxonomy the use of the common name frog and toad ha no taxonomic justification from a classification perspective all member of the order anura are frog but only member of the family bufonidae are considered true toad the use of the term frog in common name usually refers to specie that are aquatic or and have smooth moist skin the term toad generally refers to specie that are terrestrial with dry warty skin there are numerous exception to this rule the european toad bombina bombina ha a slightly warty skin and prefers a watery habitat whereas the panamanian golden frog atelopus zeteki is in the toad family bufonidae and ha a smooth skin etymology the origin of the order name anura and it original spelling anoures is the ancient greek alpha privative prefix without and oura oura meaning animal tail it refers to the tailless character of these amphibiansthe origin of the word frog are uncertain and debated the word is first attested in old english a frogga but the usual old english word for the frog wa frosc with variant such a frox and forsc and it is agreed that the word frog is somehow related to this old english frosc remained in dialectal use in english a frosh and frosk into the nineteenth century and is paralleled widely in other germanic language with example in the modern language including german frosch icelandic froskur and dutch kik vors these word allow u to reconstruct a common germanic ancestor froskaz the third edition of the oxford english dictionary find that the etymology of froskaz is uncertain but agrees with argument that it could plausibly derive from a base along the line of preu jump how old english frosc gave rise to frogga is however uncertain a the development doe not involve a regular instead it seems that there wa a trend in old english to coin nickname for animal ending in with all of uncertain dog hog pig stag and ear wig frog appears to have been adapted from frosc a part of this trendmeanwhile the word toad first attested a old english tadige is unique to english and is likewise of uncertain etymology it is the basis for the word tadpole first attested a middle english taddepol apparently meaning taxonomy about of amphibian specie are classified in the order anura these include over specie in family of which the craugastoridae spp hylidae spp microhylidae spp and bufonidae spp are the richest in specie the anura include all modern frog and any fossil specie that fit within the anuran definition the characteristic of anuran adult include or fewer presacral vertebra the presence of a urostyle formed of fused vertebra no tail a long and ilium shorter fore limb than hind limb radius and ulna fused tibia and fibula fused elongated ankle bone absence of a prefrontal bone presence of a hyoid plate a lower jaw without teeth with the exception of gastrotheca guentheri consisting of three pair of bone angulosplenial dentary and mentomeckelian with the last pair being absent in pipoidea an unsupported tongue lymph space underneath the skin and a muscle the protractor lentis attached to the lens of the eye the anuran larva or tadpole ha a single central respiratory spiracle and mouthpart consisting of keratinous beak and denticle frog and toad are broadly classified into three suborder archaeobatrachia which includes four family of primitive frog mesobatrachia which includes five family of more evolutionary intermediate frog and neobatrachia by far the largest group which contains the remaining family of modern frog including most common specie throughout the world the suborder neobatrachia is further divided into the two superfamily hyloidea and ranoidea this classification is based on such morphological feature a the number of vertebra the structure of the pectoral girdle and the morphology of tadpole while this classification is largely accepted relationship among family of frog are still debatedsome specie of anuran hybridize readily for instance the edible frog pelophylax esculentus is a hybrid between the pool frog p lessonae and the marsh frog p ridibundus the toad bombina bombina and b variegata are similar in forming hybrid these are le fertile than their parent giving rise to a hybrid zone where the hybrid are prevalent evolution the origin and evolutionary relationship between the three main group of amphibian are hotly debated a molecular phylogeny based on rdna analysis dating from suggests that salamander and caecilian are more closely related to each other than they are to frog and the divergence of the three group took place in the paleozoic or early mesozoic before the breakup of the supercontinent pangaea and soon after their divergence from the fish this would help account for the relative scarcity of amphibian fossil from the period before the group split another molecular phylogenetic analysis conducted about the same time concluded that lissamphibians first appeared about million year ago and that the hypothesis is more credible than other theory the neobatrachians seemed to have originated in the salamander in east asia and the caecilian in tropical pangaea other researcher while agreeing with the main thrust of this study questioned the choice of calibration point used to synchronise the data they proposed that the date of lissamphibian diversification should be placed in the permian rather le than million year ago a date in better agreement with the palaeontological data a further study in using both extinct and living taxon sampled for morphological a well a molecular data came to the conclusion that lissamphibia is monophyletic and that it should be nested within lepospondyli rather than within temnospondyli the study postulated that lissamphibia originated no earlier than the late carboniferous some to million year ago the split between anura and caudata wa estimated a taking place million year ago rather later than most molecular study suggest with the caecilian splitting off million year ago in gerobatrachus hottoni a temnospondyl with many and characteristic wa discovered in texas it dated back million year and wa hailed a a missing link a stem batrachian close to the common ancestor of frog and salamander consistent with the widely accepted hypothesis that frog and salamander are more closely related to each other forming a clade called batrachia than they are to caecilian however others have suggested that gerobatrachus hottoni wa only a dissorophoid temnospondyl unrelated to extant amphibianssalientia latin salere salio to jump is the name of the total group that includes modern frog in the order anura a well a their close fossil relative the or the common feature possessed by these include presacral vertebra modern frog have eight or a long and ilium in the pelvis the presence of a frontoparietal bone and a lower jaw without teeth the earliest known amphibian that were more closely related to frog than to salamander are triadobatrachus massinoti from the early triassic period of madagascar about million year ago and czatkobatrachus polonicus from the early triassic of poland about the same age a triadobatrachus the skull of triadobatrachus is being broad with large eye socket but the fossil ha feature diverging from modern frog these include a longer body with more vertebra the tail ha separate vertebra unlike the fused urostyle or coccyx in modern frog the tibia and fibula bone are also separate making it probable that triadobatrachus wa not an efficient leaperthe earliest known true frog that fall into the anuran lineage proper all lived in the early jurassic period one such early frog specie prosalirus bitis wa discovered in in the kayenta formation of arizona and date back to the early jurassic epoch to million year ago making prosalirus somewhat more recent than triadobatrachus like the latter prosalirus did not have greatly enlarged leg but had the typical pelvic structure of modern frog unlike triadobatrachus prosalirus had already lost nearly all of it tail and wa well adapted for jumping another early jurassic frog is vieraella herbsti which is known only from dorsal and ventral impression of a single animal and wa estimated to be mm in from snout to vent notobatrachus degiustoi from the middle jurassic is slightly younger about million year old the main evolutionary change in this specie involved the shortening of the body and the loss of the tail the evolution of modern anura likely wa complete by the jurassic period since then evolutionary change in chromosome number have taken place about time faster in mammal than in frog which mean speciation is occurring more rapidly in mammalsaccording to genetic study the family hyloidea microhylidae and the clade natatanura comprising about of living frog diversified simultaneously some million year ago soon after the extinction event associated with the chicxulub impactor all origin of arboreality eg in hyloidea and natatanura follow from that time and the resurgence of forest that occurred afterwardsfrog fossil have been found on all of the earth continent in it wa announced that million year old helmeted frog fossil had been discovered by a team of vertebrate paleontologist in seymour island on the antarctic peninsula indicating that this region wa once home to frog related to those now living in south american nothofagus forest phylogeny a cladogram showing the relationship of the different family of frog in the clade anura can be seen in the table below this diagram in the form of a tree show how each frog family is related to other family with each node representing a point of common ancestry it is based on frost et al heinicke et al and pyron and wiens morphology and physiology frog have no tail except a larva and most have long hind leg elongated ankle bone webbed toe no claw large eye and a smooth or warty skin they have short vertebral column with no more than free vertebra and fused tailbones urostyle or coccyx like other amphibian oxygen can pas through their highly permeable skin this unique feature allows them to remain in place without access to the air respiring through their skin rib are generally absent so the lung are filled by buccal pumping and a frog deprived of it lung can maintain it body function without them for the skin to serve a a respiratory organ it must remain moist this make frog susceptible to various substance they may encounter in the environment some of which may be toxic and can dissolve in the water film and be passed into their bloodstream this may be one of the cause of the worldwide decline in frog populationsfrogs range in size from paedophryne amauensis of papua new guinea that is mm in in length to the up to cm in and kg lb goliath frog conraua goliath of central africa there are prehistoric extinct specie that reached even larger size the skin hang loosely on the body because of the lack of loose connective tissue frog have three eyelid membrane one is transparent to protect the eye underwater and two vary from translucent to opaque they have a tympanum on each side of their head which is involved in hearing and in some specie is covered by skin true toad completely lack teeth but most frog have them specifically pedicellate teeth in which the crown is separated from the root by fibrous tissue these are on the edge of the upper jaw and vomerine teeth are also on the roof of their mouth no teeth are in the lower jaw and frog usually swallow their food whole the teeth are mainly used to grip the prey and keep it in place until swallowed a process assisted by retracting the eye into the head the african bullfrog pyxicephalus which prey on relatively large animal such a mouse and other frog ha cone shaped bony projection called odontoid process at the front of the lower jaw which function like teeth foot and leg the structure of the foot and leg varies greatly among frog specie depending in part on whether they live primarily on the ground in water in tree or in burrow frog must be able to move quickly through their environment to catch prey and escape predator and numerous adaptation help them to do so most frog are either proficient at jumping or are descended from ancestor that were with much of the musculoskeletal morphology modified for this purpose the tibia fibula and tarsal have been fused into a single strong bone a have the radius and ulna in the fore limb which must absorb the impact on landing the metatarsal have become elongated to add to the leg length and allow frog to push against the ground for a longer period on the illium ha elongated and formed a mobile joint with the sacrum which in specialist jumper such a ranid and hylids function a an additional limb joint to further power the leap the tail vertebra have fused into a urostyle which is retracted inside the pelvis this enables the force to be transferred from the leg to the body during a leap the muscular system ha been similarly modified the hind limb of ancestral frog presumably contained pair of muscle which would act in opposition one muscle to flex the knee a different muscle to extend it a is seen in most other limbed animal however in modern frog almost all muscle have been modified to contribute to the action of jumping with only a few small muscle remaining to bring the limb back to the starting position and maintain posture the muscle have also been greatly enlarged with the main leg muscle accounting for over of the total mass of frogsmany frog have webbed foot and the degree of webbing is directly proportional to the amount of time the specie spends in the water the completely aquatic african dwarf frog hymenochirus sp ha fully webbed toe whereas those of white tree frog litoria caerulea an arboreal specie are only a quarter or half webbed exception include flying frog in the hylidae and rhacophoridae which also have fully webbed toe used in gliding arboreal frog have pad located on the end of their toe to help grip vertical surface these are not suction pad the surface consisting instead of columnar cell with flat top with small gap between them lubricated by mucous gland when the frog applies pressure the cell adhere to irregularity on the surface and the grip is maintained through surface tension this allows the frog to climb on smooth surface but the system doe not function efficiently when the pad are excessively wetin many arboreal frog a small intercalary structure on each toe increase the surface area touching the substrate furthermore many arboreal frog have hip joint that allow both hopping and walking some frog that live high in tree even posse an elaborate degree of webbing between their toe this allows the frog to parachute or make a controlled glide from one position in the canopy to frog generally lack the adaptation of aquatic and arboreal frog most have smaller toe pad if any and little webbing some burrowing frog such a couch spadefoot scaphiopus couchii have a toe extension on the hind foot a keratinised tubercle often referred to a a spade that help them to burrowsometimes during the tadpole stage one of the developing rear leg is eaten by a predator such a a dragonfly nymph in some case the full leg still grows but in others it doe not although the frog may still live out it normal lifespan with only three limb occasionally a parasitic flatworm ribeiroia ondatrae dig into the rear of a tadpole causing a rearrangement of the limb bud cell and the frog develops one or more extra leg skin a frog skin is protective ha a respiratory function can absorb water and help control body temperature it ha many gland particularly on the head and back which often exude distasteful and toxic substance granular gland the secretion is often sticky and help keep the skin moist protects against the entry of mould and bacteria and make the animal slippery and more able to escape from predator the skin is shed every few week it usually split down the middle of the back and across the belly and the frog pull it arm and leg free the sloughed skin is then worked towards the head where it is quickly eatenbeing frog have to adopt suitable behaviour pattern to regulate their temperature to warm up they can move into the sun or onto a warm surface if they overheat they can move into the shade or adopt a stance that expose the minimum area of skin to the air this posture is also used to prevent water loss and involves the frog squatting close to the substrate with it hand and foot tucked under it chin and body the colour of a frog skin is used for thermoregulation in cool damp condition the colour will be darker than on a hot dry day the grey tree frog chiromantis xerampelina is even able to turn white to minimize the chance of overheatingmany frog are able to absorb water and oxygen directly through the skin especially around the pelvic area but the permeability of a frog skin can also result in water loss gland located all over the body exude mucus which help keep the skin moist and reduces evaporation some gland on the hand and chest of male are specialized to produce sticky secretion to aid in amplexus similar gland in tree frog produce a substance on the adhesive disc of the foot some arboreal frog reduce water loss by having a waterproof layer of skin and several south american specie coat their skin with a waxy secretion other frog have adopted behaviour to conserve water including becoming nocturnal and resting in a position some frog may also rest in large group with each frog pressed against it neighbour this reduces the amount of skin exposed to the air or a dry surface and thus reduces water loss woodhouse toad bufo woodhousii if given access to water after confinement in a dry location sits in the shallow to rehydrate the male hairy frog trichobatrachus robustus ha dermal papilla projecting from it lower back and thigh giving it a bristly appearance they contain blood vessel and are thought to increase the area of the skin available for respirationsome specie have bony plate embedded in their skin a trait that appears to have evolved independently several time in certain other specie the skin at the top of the head is compacted and the connective tissue of the dermis is with the bone of the skull exostosis camouflage is a common defensive mechanism in frog most camouflaged frog are nocturnal during the day they seek out a position where they can blend into the background and remain undetected some frog have the ability to change colour but this is usually restricted to a small range of colour for example white tree frog litoria caerulea varies between pale green and dull brown according to the temperature and the pacific tree frog pseudacris regilla ha green and brown morphs plain or spotted and change colour depending on the time of year and general background colour feature such a wart and skin fold are usually on frog for whom smooth skin would not provide such effective camouflage certain frog change colour between night and day a light and moisture stimulate the pigment cell and cause them to expand or contract some are even able to control their skin texture respiration and circulation the skin of a frog is permeable to oxygen and carbon dioxide a well a to water there are blood vessel near the surface of the skin and when a frog is underwater oxygen diffuses directly into the blood when not submerged a frog breathes by a process known a buccal pumping it lung are similar to those of human but the chest muscle are not involved in respiration and no rib or diaphragm exist to help move air in and out instead it puff out it throat and draw air in through the nostril which in many specie can then be closed by valve when the floor of the mouth is compressed air is forced into the lung the fully aquatic bornean frog barbourula kalimantanensis is the first frog known to lack lung entirelyfrogs have heart a feature they share with lizard oxygenated blood from the lung and blood from the respiring tissue enter the heart through separate atrium when these chamber contract the two blood stream pas into a common ventricle before being pumped via a spiral valve to the appropriate vessel the aorta for oxygenated blood and pulmonary artery for deoxygenated blood the ventricle is partially divided into narrow cavity which minimizes the mixing of the two type of blood these feature enable frog to have a higher metabolic rate and be more active than would otherwise be possiblesome specie of frog have adaptation that allow them to survive in oxygen deficient water the titicaca water frog telmatobius culeus is one such specie and ha wrinkly skin that increase it surface area to enhance gas exchange it normally make no use of it rudimentary lung but will sometimes raise and lower it body rhythmically while on the lake bed to increase the flow of water around it digestion and excretion frog have maxillary teeth along their upper jaw which are used to hold food before it is swallowed these teeth are very weak and can not be used to chew or catch and harm agile prey instead the frog us it sticky cleft tongue to catch fly and other small moving prey the tongue normally lie coiled in the mouth free at the back and attached to the mandible at the front it can be shot out and retracted at great speed some frog have no tongue and just stuff food into their mouth with their hand the eye assist in the swallowing of food a they can be retracted through hole in the skull and help push food down the throat the food then move through the oesophagus into the stomach where digestive enzyme are added and it is churned up it then proceeds to the small intestine duodenum and ileum where most digestion occurs pancreatic juice from the pancreas and bile produced by the liver and stored in the gallbladder are secreted into the small intestine where the fluid digest the food and the nutrient are absorbed the food residue pass into the large intestine where excess water is removed and the waste are passed out through the cloaca the recently discovered prometheus frog ha been reported to sometimes eat cooked or burnt food from area affected by forest firesalthough adapted to terrestrial life frog resemble freshwater fish in their inability to conserve body water effectively when they are on land much water is lost by evaporation from the skin the excretory system is similar to that of mammal and there are two kidney that remove nitrogenous product from the blood frog produce large quantity of dilute urine in order to flush out toxic product from the kidney tubule the nitrogen is excreted a ammonia by tadpole and aquatic frog but mainly a urea a le toxic product by most terrestrial adult a few specie of tree frog with little access to water excrete the even le toxic uric acid the urine pass along paired ureter to the urinary bladder from which it is vented periodically into the cloaca all bodily waste exit the body through the cloaca which terminates in a cloacal vent reproductive system in the male frog the two testis are attached to the kidney and semen pass into the kidney through fine tube called efferent duct it then travel on through the ureter which are consequently known a urinogenital duct there is no penis and sperm is ejected from the cloaca directly onto the egg a the female lay them the ovary of the female frog are beside the kidney and the egg pas down a pair of oviduct and through the cloaca to the exteriorwhen frog mate the male climb on the back of the female and wrap his fore limb round her body either behind the front leg or just in front of the hind leg this position is called amplexus and may be held for several day the male frog ha certain secondary sexual characteristic these include the development of special pad on his thumb in the breeding season to give him a firm hold the grip of the male frog during amplexus stimulates the female to release egg usually wrapped in jelly a spawn in many specie the male is smaller and slimmer than the female male have vocal cord and make a range of croak particularly in the breeding season and in some specie they also have vocal sac to amplify the sound nervous system frog have a highly developed nervous system that consists of a brain spinal cord and nerve many part of frog brain correspond with those of human it consists of two olfactory lobe two cerebral hemisphere a pineal body two optic lobe a cerebellum and a medulla oblongata muscular coordination and posture are controlled by the cerebellum and the medulla oblongata regulates respiration digestion and other automatic function the relative size of the cerebrum in frog is much smaller than it is in human frog have ten pair of cranial nerve which pas information from the outside directly to the brain and ten pair of spinal nerve which pas information from the extremity to the brain through the spinal cord by contrast all amniote mammal bird and reptile have twelve pair of cranial nerve sight the eye of most frog are located on either side of the head near the top and project outwards a hemispherical bulge they provide binocular vision over a field of to the front and a total visual field of almost they may be the only part of an otherwise submerged frog to protrude from the water each eye ha closable upper and lower lid and a nictitating membrane which provides further protection especially when the frog is swimming member of the aquatic family pipidae have the eye located at the top of the head a position better suited for detecting prey in the water above the iris come in a range of colour and the pupil in a range of shape the common toad bufo bufo ha golden iris and horizontal pupil the tree frog agalychnis callidryas ha vertical slit pupil the poison dart frog ha dark iris the toad bombina spp ha triangular pupil and the tomato frog dyscophus spp ha circular one the iris of the southern toad anaxyrus terrestris are patterned so a to blend in with the surrounding camouflaged skinthe distant vision of a frog is better than it near vision calling frog will quickly become silent when they see an intruder or even a moving shadow but the closer an object is the le well it is seen when a frog shoot out it tongue to catch an insect it is reacting to a small moving object that it can not see well and must line it up precisely beforehand because it shuts it eye a the tongue is extended although it wa formerly debated more recent research ha shown that frog can see in colour even in very low light hearing frog can hear both in the air and below water they do not have external ear the eardrum tympanic membrane are directly exposed or may be covered by a layer of skin and are visible a a circular area just behind the eye the size and distance apart of the eardrum is related to the frequency and wavelength at which the frog call in some specie such a the bullfrog the size of the tympanum indicates the sex of the frog male have tympani that are larger than their eye while in female the eye and tympani are much the same size a noise cause the tympanum to vibrate and the sound is transmitted to the middle and inner ear the middle ear contains semicircular canal which help control balance and orientation in the inner ear the auditory hair cell are arranged in two area of the cochlea the basilar papilla and the amphibian papilla the former detects high frequency and the latter low frequency because the cochlea is short frog use electrical tuning to extend their range of audible frequency and help discriminate different sound this arrangement enables detection of the territorial and breeding call of their conspecific in some specie that inhabit arid region the sound of thunder or heavy rain may arouse them from a dormant state a frog may be startled by an unexpected noise but it will not usually take any action until it ha located the source of the sound by sight call the call or croak of a frog is unique to it specie frog create this sound by passing air through the larynx in the throat in most calling frog the sound is amplified by one or more vocal sac membrane of skin under the throat or on the corner of the mouth that distend during the amplification of the call some frog call are so loud that they can be heard up to a mile away additionally some specie have been found to use structure such a drain pipe for artificial amplification of their callfrogs in the genus heleioporus and neobatrachus lack vocal sac but can still produce a loud call their buccal cavity is enlarged and acting a a resonance chamber that amplifies the sound specie of frog that lack vocal sac and that do not have a loud call tend to inhabit area close to constantly noisy flowing water they need to use an alternative mean to communicate the coastal tailed frog ascaphus truei life in mountain stream in north america and doe not vocalizethe main reason for calling is to allow male frog to attract a mate male may call individually or there may be a chorus of sound where numerous male have converged on breeding site female of many frog specie such a the common tree frog polypedates leucomystax reply to the male call which act to reinforce reproductive activity in a breeding colony female frog prefer male that produce sound of greater intensity and lower frequency attribute that stand out in a crowd the rationale for this is thought to be that by demonstrating his prowess the male show his fitness to produce superior offspringa different call is emitted by a male frog or unreceptive female when mounted by another male this is a distinct chirruping sound and is accompanied by a vibration of the body tree frog and some specie have a rain call that they make on the basis of humidity cue prior to a shower many specie also have a territorial call that is used to drive away other male all of these call are emitted with the mouth of the frog closed a distress call emitted by some frog when they are in danger is produced with the mouth open resulting in a call it is typically used when the frog ha been grabbed by a predator and may serve to distract or disorientate the attacker so that it release the frog many specie of frog have deep call the croak of the american bullfrog rana catesbiana is sometimes written a jug o rum the pacific tree frog pseudacris regilla produce the onomatopoeic ribbit often heard in film other rendering of frog call into speech include brekekekex koax koax the call of the marsh frog pelophylax ridibundus in the frog an ancient greek comic drama by aristophanes the call of the torrent frog amolops tormotus are unusual in many aspect the male are notable for their variety of call where upward and downward frequency modulation take place when they communicate they produce call that fall in the ultrasound frequency range the last aspect that make this specie of frog call unusual is that nonlinear acoustic phenomenon are important component in their acoustic signal torpor during extreme condition some frog enter a state of torpor and remain inactive for month in colder region many specie of frog hibernate in winter those that live on land such a the american toad bufo americanus dig a burrow and make a hibernaculum in which to lie dormant others le proficient at digging find a crevice or bury themselves in dead leaf aquatic specie such a the american bullfrog rana catesbeiana normally sink to the bottom of the pond where they lie in mud but still able to access the oxygen dissolved in the water their metabolism slows down and they live on their energy reserve some frog such a the wood frog or spring peeper can even survive being frozen ice crystal form under the skin and in the body cavity but the essential organ are protected from freezing by a high concentration of glucose an apparently lifeless frozen frog can resume respiration and it heartbeat can restart when condition warm upat the other extreme the striped burrowing frog cyclorana alboguttata regularly aestivates during the hot dry season in australia surviving in a dormant state without access to food and water for nine or ten month of the year it burrow underground and curl up inside a protective cocoon formed by it shed skin researcher at the university of queensland have found that during aestivation the metabolism of the frog is altered and the operational efficiency of the mitochondrion is increased this mean that the limited amount of energy available to the comatose frog is used in a more efficient manner this survival mechanism is only useful to animal that remain completely unconscious for an extended period of time and whose energy requirement are low because they are and have no need to generate heat other research showed that to provide these energy requirement muscle atrophy but hind limb muscle are preferentially unaffected frog have been found to have upper critical temperature of around degree celsius locomotion different specie of frog use a number of method of moving around including jumping running walking swimming burrowing climbing and gliding jumpingfrogs are generally recognized a exceptional jumper and relative to their size the best jumper of all vertebrate the striped rocket frog litoria nasuta can leap over metre ft in a distance that is more than fifty time it body length of centimetre in there are tremendous difference between specie in jumping capability within a specie jump distance increase with increasing size but relative jumping distance jumped decrease the indian skipper frog euphlyctis cyanophlyctis ha the ability to leap out of the water from a position floating on the surface the tiny northern cricket frog acris crepitans can skitter across the surface of a pond with a series of short rapid photography show that the muscle have passive flexibility they are first stretched while the frog is still in the crouched position then they are contracted before being stretched again to launch the frog into the air the fore leg are folded against the chest and the hind leg remain in the extended streamlined position for the duration of the jump in some extremely capable jumper such a the cuban tree frog osteopilus septentrionalis and the northern leopard frog rana pipiens the peak power exerted during a jump can exceed that which the muscle is theoretically capable of producing when the muscle contract the energy is first transferred into the stretched tendon which is wrapped around the ankle bone then the muscle stretch again at the same time a the tendon release it energy like a catapult to produce a powerful acceleration beyond the limit of acceleration a similar mechanism ha been documented in locust and grasshopper walking and running frog in the family bufonidae rhinophrynidae and microhylidae have short back leg and tend to walk rather than jump when they try to move rapidly they speed up the rate of movement of their limb or resort to an ungainly hopping gait the great plain toad gastrophryne olivacea ha been described a having a gait that is a combination of running and short hop that are usually only an inch or two in length in an experiment fowler toad bufo fowleri wa placed on a treadmill which wa turned at varying speed by measuring the toad uptake of oxygen it wa found that hopping wa an inefficient use of resource during sustained locomotion but wa a useful strategy during short burst of activitythe running frog kassina maculata ha short slim hind limb unsuited to jumping it can move fast by using a running gait in which the two hind leg are used alternately photography show unlike a horse that can trot or gallop the frog gait remained similar at slow medium and fast speed this specie can also climb tree and shrub and doe so at night to catch insect the indian skipper frog euphlyctis cyanophlyctis ha broad foot and can run across the surface of the water for several metre yard swimming frog that live in or visit water have adaptation that improve their swimming ability the hind limb are heavily muscled and strong the webbing between the toe of the hind foot increase the area of the foot and help propel the frog powerfully through the water member of the family pipidae are wholly aquatic and show the most marked specialization they have inflexible vertebral column flattened streamlined body lateral line system and powerful hind limb with large webbed foot tadpole mostly have large tail fin which provide thrust when the tail is moved from side to side burrowingsome frog have become adapted for burrowing and a life underground they tend to have rounded body short limb small head with bulging eye and hind foot adapted for excavation an extreme example of this is the purple frog nasikabatrachus sahyadrensis from southern india which feed on termite and spends almost it whole life underground it emerges briefly during the monsoon to mate and breed in temporary pool it ha a tiny head with a pointed snout and a plump rounded body because of this fossorial existence it wa first described in being new to the scientific community at that time although previously known to local people the spadefoot toad of north america are also adapted to underground life the plain spadefoot toad spea bombifrons is typical and ha a flap of keratinised bone attached to one of the metatarsal of the hind foot which it us to dig itself backwards into the ground a it dig the toad wriggle it hip from side to side to sink into the loose soil it ha a shallow burrow in the summer from which it emerges at night to forage in winter it dig much deeper and ha been recorded at a depth of m ft the tunnel is filled with soil and the toad hibernates in a small chamber at the end during this time urea accumulates in it tissue and water is drawn in from the surrounding damp soil by osmosis to supply the toad need spadefoot toad are explosive breeder all emerging from their burrow at the same time and converging on temporary pool attracted to one of these by the calling of the first male to find a suitable breeding locationthe burrowing frog of australia have a rather different lifestyle the western spotted frog heleioporus albopunctatus dig a burrow beside a river or in the bed of an ephemeral stream and regularly emerges to forage mating take place and egg are laid in a foam nest inside the burrow the egg partially develop there but do not hatch until they are submerged following heavy rainfall the tadpole then swim out into the open water and rapidly complete their development madagascan burrowing frog are le fossorial and mostly bury themselves in leaf litter one of these the green burrowing frog scaphiophryne marmorata ha a flattened head with a short snout and metatarsal tubercle on it hind foot to help with excavation it also ha greatly enlarged terminal disc on it fore foot that help it to clamber around in bush it breed in temporary pool that form after rain climbing tree frog live high in the canopy where they scramble around on the branch twig and leaf sometimes never coming down to earth the true tree frog belong to the family hylidae but member of other frog family have independently adopted an arboreal habit a case of convergent evolution these include the glass frog centrolenidae the bush frog hyperoliidae some of the frog microhylidae and the shrub frog rhacophoridae most tree frog are under cm in in length with long leg and long toe with adhesive pad on the tip the surface of the toe pad is formed from a closely packed layer of hexagonal epidermal cell separated by groove into which gland secrete mucus these toe pad moistened by the mucus provide the grip on any wet or dry surface including glass the force involved include boundary friction of the toe pad epidermis on the surface and also surface tension and viscosity tree frog are very acrobatic and can catch insect while hanging by one toe from a twig or clutching onto the blade of a windswept reed some member of the subfamily phyllomedusinae have opposable toe on their foot the reticulated leaf frog phyllomedusa ayeaye ha a single opposed digit on each fore foot and two opposed digit on it hind foot this allows it to grasp the stem of bush a it clamber around in it riverside habitat glidingduring the evolutionary history of frog several different group have independently taken to the air some frog in the tropical rainforest are specially adapted for gliding from tree to tree or parachuting to the forest floor typical of them is wallace flying frog rhacophorus nigropalmatus from malaysia and borneo it ha large foot with the fingertip expanded into flat adhesive disc and the digit fully webbed flap of skin occur on the lateral margin of the limb and across the tail region with the digit splayed the limb outstretched and these flap spread it can glide considerable distance but is unable to undertake powered flight it can alter it direction of travel and navigate distance of up to m ft between tree life history like other amphibian the life cycle of a frog normally start in water with an egg that hatch into a limbless larva with gill commonly known a a tadpole after further growth during which it develops limb and lung the tadpole undergoes metamorphosis in which it appearance and internal organ are rearranged after this it is able to leave the water a a miniature frog reproduction two main type of reproduction occur in frog prolonged breeding and explosive breeding in the former adopted by the majority of specie adult frog at certain time of year assemble at a pond lake or stream to breed many frog return to the body of water in which they developed a larva this often result in annual migration involving thousand of individual in explosive breeder mature adult frog arrive at breeding site in response to certain trigger factor such a rainfall occurring in an arid area in these frog mating and spawning take place promptly and the speed of larval growth is rapid in order to make use of the ephemeral pool before they dry upamong prolonged breeder male usually arrive at the breeding site first and remain there for some time whereas female tend to arrive later and depart soon after they have spawned this mean that male outnumber female at the water edge and defend territory from which they expel other male they advertise their presence by calling often alternating their croak with neighbouring frog larger stronger male tend to have deeper call and maintain higher quality territory female select their mate at least partly on the basis of the depth of their voice in some specie there are satellite male who have no territory and do not call they may intercept female that are approaching a calling male or take over a vacated territory calling is an activity sometimes the two role are reversed and a calling male give up it territory and becomes a satellite in explosive breeder the first male that find a suitable breeding location such a a temporary pool call loudly and other frog of both sex converge on the pool explosive breeder tend to call in unison creating a chorus that can be heard from far away the spadefoot toad scaphiopus spp of north america fall into this category mate selection and courtship is not a important a speed in reproduction in some year suitable condition may not occur and the frog may go for two or more year without breeding some female new mexico spadefoot toad spea multiplicata only spawn half of the available egg at a time perhaps retaining some in case a better reproductive opportunity arises laterat the breeding site the male mount the female and grip her tightly round the body typically amplexus take place in the water the female release her egg and the male cover them with sperm fertilization is external in many specie such a the great plain toad bufo cognatus the male restrains the egg with his back foot holding them in place for about three minute member of the west african genus nimbaphrynoides are unique among frog in that they are viviparous limnonectes larvaepartus eleutherodactylus jasperi and member of the tanzanian genus nectophrynoides are the only frog known to be ovoviviparous in these specie fertilization is internal and female give birth to fully developed juvenile frog except l larvaepartus which give birth to tadpole life cycle egg frogspawn frog embryo are typically surrounded by several layer of gelatinous material when several egg are clumped together they are collectively known a frogspawn the jelly provides support and protection while allowing the passage of oxygen carbon dioxide and ammonia it absorbs moisture and swell on contact with water after fertilization the innermost portion liquifies to allow free movement of the developing embryo in certain specie such a the northern frog rana aurora and the wood frog rana sylvatica symbiotic unicellular green algae are present in the gelatinous material it is thought that these may benefit the developing larva by providing them with extra oxygen through photosynthesis most egg are black or dark brown and this ha the advantage of absorbing warmth from the sun which the insulating capsule retains the interior of globular egg cluster of the wood frog rana sylvatica ha been found to be up to warmer than the surrounding water and this speed up the development of the larvaethe shape and size of the egg mass is characteristic of the specie ranid tend to produce globular cluster containing large number of egg whereas bufonids produce long cylindrical string the tiny pygmy eleuth eleutherodactylus limbatus lay egg singly burying them in moist soil the smoky jungle frog leptodactylus pentadactylus make a nest of foam in a hollow the egg hatch when the nest is flooded or the tadpole may complete their development in the foam if flooding doe not occur the treefrog agalychnis callidryas deposit it egg on a leaf above a pool and when they hatch the larva fall into the water below the larva developing in the egg can detect vibration caused by nearby predatory wasp or snake and will hatch early to avoid being eaten in general the length of the egg stage depends on the specie and the environmental condition aquatic egg normally hatch within one week when the capsule split a a result of enzyme released by the developing larva tadpole the larva that emerge from the egg known a tadpole or occasionally polliwog typically have oval body and long vertically flattened tail a a general rule larva are fully aquatic but at least one specie nannophrys ceylonensis ha semiterrestrial tadpole which live among wet rock tadpole lack eyelid and have cartilaginous skeleton lateral line system gill for respiration external gill at first internal gill later and vertically flattened tail they use for swimmingfrom early in it development a gill pouch cover the tadpole gill and front leg the lung soon start to develop and are used a an accessory breathing organ some specie go through metamorphosis while still inside the egg and hatch directly into small frog tadpole lack true teeth but the jaw in most specie have two elongated parallel row of small keratinized structure called keradonts in their upper jaw their lower jaw usually have three row of keradonts surrounded by a horny beak but the number of row can vary and the exact arrangement of mouth part provide a mean for specie identification in the pipidae with the exception of hymenochirus the tadpole have paired anterior barbel which make them resemble small catfish their tail are stiffened by a notochord but doe not contain any bony or cartilaginous element except for a few vertebra at the base which form the urostyle during metamorphosis this ha been suggested a an adaptation to their lifestyle because the transformation into frog happens very fast the tail is made of soft tissue only a bone and cartilage take a much longer time to be broken down and absorbed the tail fin and tip is fragile and will easily tear which is seen a an adaptation to escape from predator which try to grasp them by the tailtadpoles are typically herbivorous feeding mostly on algae including diatom filtered from the water through the gill some specie are carnivorous at the tadpole stage eating insect smaller tadpole and fish the cuban tree frog osteopilus septentrionalis is one of a number of specie in which the tadpole can be cannibalistic tadpole that develop leg early may be eaten by the others so late developer may have better survival prospectstadpoles are highly vulnerable to being eaten by fish newt predatory diving beetle and bird such a kingfisher some tadpole including those of the cane toad bufo marinus are poisonous the tadpole stage may be a short a a week in explosive breeder or it may last through one or more winter followed by metamorphosis in the spring metamorphosis at the end of the tadpole stage a frog undergoes metamorphosis in which it body make a sudden transition into the adult form this metamorphosis typically last only hour and is initiated by production of the hormone thyroxine this cause different tissue to develop in different way the principal change that take place include the development of the lung and the disappearance of the gill and gill pouch making the front leg visible the lower jaw transforms into the big mandible of the carnivorous adult and the long spiral gut of the herbivorous tadpole is replaced by the typical short gut of a predator the nervous system becomes adapted for hearing and stereoscopic vision and for new method of locomotion and feeding the eye are repositioned higher up on the head and the eyelid and associated gland are formed the eardrum middle ear and inner ear are developed the skin becomes thicker and tougher the lateral line system is lost and skin gland are developed the final stage is the disappearance of the tail but this take place rather later the tissue being used to produce a spurt of growth in the limb frog are at their most vulnerable to predator when they are undergoing metamorphosis at this time the tail is being lost and locomotion by mean of limb is only just becoming established adult after metamorphosis young adult may disperse into terrestrial habitat or continue to live in water almost all frog specie are carnivorous a adult preying on invertebrate including arthropod worm snail and slug a few of the larger one may eat other frog small mammal and fish some frog use their sticky tongue to catch prey while others push food into their mouth with their hand a few specie also eat plant matter the tree frog xenohyla truncata is partly herbivorous it diet including a large proportion of fruit leptodactylus mystaceus ha been found to eat plant and folivory occurs in euphlyctis hexadactylus with plant constituting of it diet by volume adult frog are themselves attacked by many predator the northern leopard frog rana pipiens is eaten by heron hawk fish large salamander snake raccoon skunk mink bullfrog and other animal frog are primary predator and an important part of the food web being they make efficient use of the food they eat with little energy being used for metabolic process while the rest is transformed into biomass they are themselves eaten by secondary predator and are the primary terrestrial consumer of invertebrate most of which feed on plant by reducing herbivory they play a part in increasing the growth of plant and are thus part of a delicately balanced ecosystemlittle is known about the longevity of frog and toad in the wild but some can live for many year skeletochronology is a method of examining bone to determine age using this method the age of mountain frog rana muscosa were studied the phalanx of the toe showing seasonal line where growth slows in winter the oldest frog had ten band so their age wa believed to be year including the tadpole stage captive frog and toad have been recorded a living for up to year an age achieved by a european common toad bufo bufo the cane toad bufo marinus ha been known to survive year in captivity and the american bullfrog rana catesbeiana year frog from temperate climate hibernate during the winter and four specie are known to be able to withstand freezing during this time including the wood frog rana sylvatica parental care although care of offspring is poorly understood in frog up to an estimated of amphibian specie may care for their young in some way the evolution of parental care in frog is driven primarily by the size of the water body in which they breed those that breed in smaller water body tend to have greater and more complex parental care behaviour because predation of egg and larva is high in large water body some frog specie started to lay their egg on land once this happened the desiccating terrestrial environment demand that one or both parent keep them moist to ensure their survival the subsequent need to transport hatched tadpole to a water body required an even more intense form of parental carein small pool predator are mostly absent and competition between tadpole becomes the variable that constrains their survival certain frog specie avoid this competition by making use of smaller phytotelmata leaf axil or small woody cavity a site for depositing a few tadpole while these smaller rearing site are free from competition they also lack sufficient nutrient to support a tadpole without parental assistance frog specie that changed from the use of larger to smaller phytotelmata have evolved a strategy of providing their offspring with nutritive but unfertilized egg the female strawberry frog oophaga pumilio lay her egg on the forest floor the male frog guard them from predation and carry water in his cloaca to keep them moist when they hatch the female move the tadpole on her back to a bromeliad or other similar water body depositing just one in each location she visit them regularly and feed them by laying one or two unfertilized egg in the phytotelma continuing to do this until the young are large enough to undergo metamorphosis the granular poison frog oophaga granulifera look after it tadpole in a similar waymany other diverse form of parental care are seen in frog the tiny male colostethus subpunctatus stand guard over his egg cluster laid under a stone or log when the egg hatch he transport the tadpole on his back to a temporary pool where he partially immerses himself in the water and one or more tadpole drop off he then move on to another pool the male common midwife toad alytes obstetricans carry the egg around with him attached to his hind leg he keep them damp in dry weather by immersing himself in a pond and prevents them from getting too wet in soggy vegetation by raising his hindquarter after three to six week he travel to a pond and the egg hatch into tadpole the tungara frog physalaemus pustulosus build a floating nest from foam to protect it egg from predation the foam is made from protein and lectin and seems to have antimicrobial property several pair of frog may form a colonial nest on a previously built raft the egg are laid in the centre followed by alternate layer of foam and egg finishing with a foam cappingsome frog protect their offspring inside their own body both male and female pouched frog assa darlingtoni guard their egg which are laid on the ground when the egg hatch the male lubricates his body with the jelly surrounding them and immerses himself in the egg mass the tadpole wriggle into skin pouch on his side where they develop until they metamorphose into juvenile frog the female frog rheobatrachus sp from australia now probably extinct swallow her fertilized egg which then develop inside her stomach she cease to feed and stop secreting stomach acid the tadpole rely on the yolk of the egg for nourishment after six or seven week they are ready for metamorphosis the mother regurgitates the tiny frog which hop away from her mouth the female darwin frog rhinoderma darwinii from chile lay up to egg on the ground where they are guarded by the male when the tadpole are about to hatch they are engulfed by the male which carry them around inside his vocal sac here they are immersed in a frothy viscous liquid that contains some nourishment to supplement what they obtain from the yolk of the egg they remain in the sac for seven to ten week before undergoing metamorphosis after which they move into the male mouth and emerge defence at first sight frog seem rather defenceless because of their small size slow movement thin skin and lack of defensive structure such a spine claw or teeth many use camouflage to avoid detection the skin often being spotted or streaked in neutral colour that allow a stationary frog to merge into it surroundings some can make prodigious leap often into water that help them to evade potential attacker while many have other defensive adaptation and strategiesthe skin of many frog contains mild toxic substance called bufotoxins to make them unpalatable to potential predator most toad and some frog have large poison gland the parotoid gland located on the side of their head behind the eye and other gland elsewhere on their body these gland secrete mucus and a range of toxin that make frog slippery to hold and distasteful or poisonous if the noxious effect is immediate the predator may cease it action and the frog may escape if the effect develops more slowly the predator may learn to avoid that specie in future poisonous frog tend to advertise their toxicity with bright colour an adaptive strategy known a aposematism the poison dart frog in the family dendrobatidae do this they are typically red orange or yellow often with contrasting black marking on their body allobates zaparo is not poisonous but mimic the appearance of two different toxic specie with which it share a common range in an effort to deceive predator other specie such a the european toad bombina bombina have their warning colour underneath they flash this when attacked adopting a pose that expose the vivid colouring on their belly some frog such a the poison dart frog are especially toxic the native people of south america extract poison from these frog to apply to their weapon for hunting although few specie are toxic enough to be used for this purpose at least two frog specie in tropical america eleutherodactylus gaigei and lithodytes lineatus mimic the colouration of dart poison frog for some frog obtain poison from the ant and other arthropod they eat others such a the australian corroboree frog pseudophryne corroboree and pseudophryne pengilleyi can synthesize the alkaloid themselves the chemical involved may be irritant hallucinogen convulsants nerve poison or vasoconstrictor many predator of frog have become adapted to tolerate high level of these poison but other creature including human who handle the frog may be severely affectedsome frog use bluff or deception the european common toad bufo bufo adopts a characteristic stance when attacked inflating it body and standing with it hindquarter raised and it head lowered the bullfrog rana catesbeiana crouch down with eye closed and head tipped forward when threatened this place the parotoid gland in the most effective position the other gland on it back begin to ooze noxious secretion and the most vulnerable part of it body are protected another tactic used by some frog is to scream the sudden loud noise tending to startle the predator the gray tree frog hyla versicolor make an explosive sound that sometimes repels the shrew blarina brevicauda although toad are avoided by many predator the common garter snake thamnophis sirtalis regularly feed on them the strategy employed by juvenile american toad bufo americanus on being approached by a snake is to crouch down and remain immobile this is usually successful with the snake passing by and the toad remaining undetected if it is encountered by the snake head however the toad hop away before crouching defensively distribution frog live on all the continent except antarctica but they are not present on certain island especially those far away from continental land mass many specie are isolated in restricted range by change of climate or inhospitable territory such a stretch of sea mountain ridge desert forest clearance road construction or other barrier usually a greater diversity of frog occurs in tropical area than in temperate region such a europe some frog inhabit arid area such a desert and rely on specific adaptation to survive member of the australian genus cyclorana bury themselves underground where they create a cocoon in which to aestivate during dry period once it rain they emerge find a temporary pool and breed egg and tadpole development is very fast in comparison to those of most other frog so breeding can be completed before the pond dry up some frog specie are adapted to a cold environment the wood frog rana sylvatica whose habitat extends into the arctic circle buries itself in the ground during winter although much of it body freeze during this time it maintains a high concentration of glucose in it vital organ which protects them from damage conservation in of specie of amphibian that depend on water during some lifecycle stage were considered to be threatened this is likely to be an underestimate because it excludes specie for which evidence wa insufficient to ass their status frog population have declined dramatically since the more than of frog specie are considered to be threatened with extinction and more than specie are believed to have become extinct since the among these specie are the frog of australia and the golden toad of costa rica the latter is of particular concern to scientist because it inhabited the pristine monteverde cloud forest reserve and it population crashed in along with about other frog specie in the area this could not be linked directly to human activity such a deforestation and wa outside the range of normal fluctuation in population size elsewhere habitat loss is a significant cause of frog population decline a are pollutant climate change increased uvb radiation and the introduction of predator and competitor a canadian study conducted in suggested heavy traffic in their environment wa a larger threat to frog population than wa habitat loss emerging infectious disease including chytridiomycosis and ranavirus are also devastating populationsmany environmental scientist believe amphibian including frog are good biological indicator of broader ecosystem health because of their intermediate position in food chain their permeable skin and typically biphasic life aquatic larva and terrestrial adult it appears that specie with both aquatic egg and larva are most affected by the decline while those with direct development are the most resistant frog mutation and genetic defect have increased since the these often include missing leg or extra leg various cause have been identified or hypothesized including an increase in ultraviolet radiation affecting the spawn on the surface of pond chemical contamination from pesticide and fertilizer and parasite such a the trematode ribeiroia ondatrae probably all these are involved in a complex way a stressor environmental factor contributing to rate of disease and vulnerability to attack by parasite malformation impair mobility and the individual may not survive to adulthood an increase in the number of frog eaten by bird may actually increase the likelihood of parasitism of other frog because the trematode complex lifecycle includes the ramshorn snail and several intermediate host such a birdsin a few case captive breeding program have been established and have largely been successful the world association of zoo and aquarium named a the year of the frog in order to draw attention to the conservation issue faced by themthe cane toad bufo marinus is a very adaptable specie native to south and central america in the it wa introduced into puerto rico and later various other island in the pacific and caribbean region a a biological pest control agent in toad were liberated in the sugar cane field of queensland australia in an attempt to control cane beetle such a dermolepida albohirtum the larva of which damage and kill the cane initial result in many of these country were positive but it later became apparent that the toad upset the ecological balance in their new environment they bred freely competed with native frog specie ate bee and other harmless native invertebrate had few predator in their adopted habitat and poisoned pet carnivorous bird and mammal in many of these country they are now regarded both a pest and invasive specie and scientist are looking for a biological method to control them us culinary frog leg are eaten by human in many part of the world french cuisse de grenouille or frog leg dish is a traditional dish particularly served in the region of the dombes departement of ain the dish is also common in part of louisiana particularly the cajun area of southern louisiana a well a new orleans united state in asia frog leg

cuisine in indonesia soup is known a swikee or swike indonesia is the world largest exporter of frog meat exporting more than tonne of frog meat each year mostly to france belgium and luxembourgoriginally they were supplied from local wild population but overexploitation led to a diminution in the supply this resulted in the development of frog farming and a global trade in frog the main importing country are france belgium luxembourg and the united state while the chief exporting nation are indonesia and china the annual global trade in the american bullfrog rana catesbeiana

often first being injected with coloured substance to enhance contrast among the biological system this practice is declining due to animal welfare concern and digital frog are now available for virtual dissectionfrogs have served a experimental animal throughout the history of science biologist luigi galvani discovered the link between electricity and the nervous system by studying frog in h f stannius used a frog heart in a procedure called a stannius ligature to demonstrate the ventricle and atrium beat independently of each other and at different rate the african clawed frog or platanna xenopus laevis wa first widely used in laboratory in pregnancy test in the first half of the century a sample of urine from a pregnant woman injected into a female frog induces it to lay egg a discovery made by english zoologist lancelot hogben this is because a hormone human chorionic gonadotropin is present in substantial quantity in the urine of woman during pregnancy in robert briggs and thomas j king cloned a frog by somatic cell nuclear transfer this same technique wa later used to create dolly the sheep and their experiment wa the first time a successful nuclear transplantation had been accomplished in higher animalsfrogs are used in cloning research and other branch of embryology although alternative pregnancy test have been developed biologist continue to use xenopus a a model organism in developmental biology because their embryo are large and easy to manipulate they are readily obtainable and can easily be kept in the laboratory xenopus laevis is increasingly being displaced by it smaller relative xenopus tropicalis which reach it reproductive age in five month rather than the one to two year for x laevis thus facilitating faster study across generation genome of xenopus laevis x tropicalis rana catesbeiana rhinella marina and nanorana parkeri have been sequenced and deposited in the ncbi genome database pharmaceutical because frog toxin are extraordinarily diverse they have raised the interest of biochemist a a natural pharmacy the alkaloid epibatidine a painkiller time more potent than morphine is made by some specie of poison dart frog although it can also cause death by lung paralysis other chemical isolated from the skin of frog may offer resistance to hiv infection dart poison are under active investigation for their potential a therapeutic drugsit ha long been suspected that mesoamerican used a toxic secretion produced by the cane toad a a hallucinogen but more likely they used substance secreted by the colorado river toad bufo alvarius these contain bufotenin a psychoactive compound that ha been used in modern time a a recreational drug typically the skin secretion are dried and then smoked illicit drug use by licking the skin of a toad ha been reported in the medium but this may be an urban myth exudation from the skin of the golden poison frog phyllobates terribilis are traditionally used by native colombian to poison the dart they use for hunting the tip of the projectile is rubbed over the back of the frog and the dart is launched from a blowgun the combination of the two alkaloid toxin batrachotoxin and homobatrachotoxin is so powerful one frog contains enough poison to kill an estimated mouse two other specie the kokoe poison dart frog phyllobates aurotaenia and the dart frog phyllobates bicolor are also used for this purpose these are le toxic and le abundant than the golden poison frog they are impaled on pointed stick and may be heated over a fire to maximise the quantity of poison that can be transferred to the dart cultural belief frog feature prominently in folklore fairy tale and popular culture they tend to be portrayed a benign ugly and clumsy but with hidden talent example include michigan j frog the frog prince and kermit the frog the warner brother cartoon one froggy evening feature michigan j frog that will only dance and sing for the demolition worker who open his time capsule but will not perform in public the frog prince is a fairy tale about a frog that turn into a handsome prince after he ha rescued a princess golden ball and she ha taken him into her palace kermit the frog is a conscientious and disciplined character from the muppet show and sesame street while openly friendly and greatly talented he is often portrayed a cringing at the fanciful behavior of more flamboyant charactersthe moche people of ancient peru worshipped animal and often depicted frog in their art in panama local legend held that good fortune would come to anyone who spotted a panamanian golden frog some believed when one of these frog died it would turn into a golden talisman known a a huaca today despite being extinct in the wild panamanian golden frog remain an important cultural
