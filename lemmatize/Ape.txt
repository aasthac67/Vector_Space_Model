ape hominoidea are a branch of old world tailless simian native to africa and southeast asia they are the sister group of the old world monkey together forming the catarrhine clade they are distinguished from other primate by a wider degree of freedom of motion at the shoulder joint a evolved by the influence of brachiation in traditional and use the term ape excludes human and can include tailless primate taxonomically considered monkey such a the barbary ape and is thus not equivalent to the scientific taxon hominoidea there are two extant branch of the superfamily hominoidea the gibbon or lesser ape and the hominid or great ape the family hylobatidae the lesser ape include four genus and a total of sixteen specie of gibbon including the lar gibbon and the siamang all native to asia they are highly arboreal and bipedal on the ground they have lighter body and smaller social group than great ape the family hominidae hominid the great ape also include four genus comprising three extant specie of orangutan and their subspecies two extant specie of gorilla and their subspecies two extant specie of chimpanzee and their subspecies and one extant specie of human in a single extant subspeciesexcept for gorilla and human hominoid are agile climber of tree ape eat a variety of plant and animal food with the majority of food being plant food which can include fruit leaf stalk root and seed including nut and grass seed human diet are sometimes substantially different from that of other ape due in part to the development of technology and a wide range of habitation human are by far the most numerous of the ape specie in fact outnumbering all other primate by a factor of several thousand to one most hominoid are rare or endangered the chief threat to most of the endangered specie is loss of tropical rainforest habitat though some population are further imperiled by hunting for bushmeat the great ape of africa are also facing threat from the ebola virus currently considered to be the greatest threat to survival of african ape ebola infection is responsible for the death of at least one third of all gorilla and chimpanzee since name and terminology ape from old english apa is a word of uncertain origin the term ha a history of rather imprecise of comedic or punning usage in the vernacular it earliest meaning wa generally of any anthropoid primate a is still the case for it cognate in other germanic language later after the term monkey had been introduced into english ape wa specialized to refer to a tailless therefore exceptionally primate thus the term ape obtained two different meaning a shown in the encyclopaedia britannica entry it could be used a a synonym for monkey and it could denote the tailless humanlike primate in particularsome or recently all hominoid are also called ape but the term is used broadly and ha several different sens within both popular and scientific setting ape ha been used a a synonym for monkey or for naming any primate with a appearance particularly those without a tail biologist have traditionally used the term ape to mean a member of the superfamily hominoidea other than human but more recently to mean all member of hominoidea so ape to be confused with great ape becomes another word for hominoid including humansthe taxonomic term hominoid is derived from and intended a encompassing the hominid the family of great ape both term were introduced by gray the term hominins is also due to gray intended a including the human lineage see also hominidae terminology human taxonomy the distinction between ape and monkey is complicated by the traditional paraphyly of monkey ape emerged a a sister group of old world monkey in the catarhines which are a sister group of new world monkey therefore cladistically ape catarrhine and related contemporary extinct group such a parapithecidaea are monkey a well for any consistent definition of monkey old world monkey may also legitimately be taken to be meant to include all the catarrhine including ape and extinct specie such a aegyptopithecus in which case the ape cercopithecoidea and aegyptopithecus emerged within the old world monkey the primate called ape today became known to european after the century a zoological knowledge developed it became clear that taillessness occurred in a number of different and otherwise distantly related specie sir wilfrid le gros clark wa one of those primatologists who developed the idea that there were trend in primate evolution and that the extant member of the order could be arranged in an ascending series leading from monkey to ape to human within this tradition ape came to refer to all member of the superfamily hominoidea except human a such this use of ape represented a paraphyletic grouping meaning that even though all specie of ape were descended from a common ancestor this grouping did not include all the descendant specie because human were excluded from being among the apestraditionally the vernacular name ape doe not include human but phylogenetically human homo form part of the family hominidae within hominoidaea thus there are at least three common or traditional us of the term ape may not distinguish between monkey and ape that is they may use the two term interchangeably or they may use ape for any tailless monkey or hominoid or they may use the term ape to just mean the hominoid modern taxonomy aim for the use of monophyletic group for taxonomic classification some literature may now use the common name ape to mean all member of the superfamily hominoidea including human for example in his book benton wrote the ape hominoidea today include the gibbon and the gorilla and chimpanzee and human modern biologist and primatologists refer to ape that are not human a ape scientist broadly other than paleoanthropologists may use the term hominin to identify the human clade replacing the term hominid see terminology of primate name see below history of hominoid taxonomy for a discussion of change in scientific classification and terminology regarding hominoid phylogeny genetic analysis combined with fossil evidence indicates that hominoid diverged from the old world monkey about million year ago mya near the boundarythe gibbon split from the rest about mya and the hominid split happened mya pongo mya gorilla and mya homo pan in a new genus and specie were described pliobates cataloniae which lived mya and appears to predate the split between hominidae and hylobatidae the family and extant

their major differentiating characteristic is their long arm which they use to brachiate through tree their wrist are ball and socket joint a an evolutionary adaptation to their arboreal lifestyle generally smaller than the african ape the largest gibbon the siamang weighs up to kg lb in comparison the smallest great ape the bonobo is to kg to lb the superfamily hominoidea fall within the parvorder catarrhini which also includes the old world monkey of africa and eurasia within this grouping the two family hylobatidae and hominidae can be distinguished from old world monkey by the number of cusp on their molar hominoid have five in the molar pattern whereas old world monkey have only four in a bilophodont pattern further in comparison with old world monkey hominoid are noted for more mobile shoulder joint and arm due to the dorsal position of the scapula broader ribcages that are flatter and a shorter le mobile spine with greatly reduced caudal tail in complete loss of the tail in living hominoid specie these are anatomical adaptation first to vertical hanging and swinging locomotion brachiation and later to developing balance in a bipedal pose note there are primate in other family that also lack tail and at least one the langur is known to walk significant distance bipedally the front of the ape skull is characterised by it sinus fusion of the frontal bone and by constriction although the hominoid fossil record is still incomplete and fragmentary there is now enough evidence to provide an outline of the evolutionary history of human previously the divergence between human and other living hominoid wa thought to have occurred to million year ago and several specie of that time period such a ramapithecus were once thought to be hominins and possible ancestor of human but later fossil find indicated that ramapithecus wa more closely related to the orangutan and new biochemical evidence indicates that the last common ancestor of human and that is the chimpanzee occurred between and million year ago and probably nearer the lower end of that range see last common ancestor chlca distinction from monkey cladistically ape catarrhine and extinct specie such a aegyptopithecus and parapithecidaea are monkey so one can only specify ape feature not present in other monkey ape do not posse a tail unlike most monkey monkey are more likely to be in tree and use their tail for balance while the great ape are considerably larger than monkey gibbon lesser ape are smaller than some monkey ape are considered to be more intelligent than monkey which are considered to have more primitive brain behaviour major study of behaviour in the field were completed on the three great ape for example by jane goodall dian fossey and birute galdikas these study have shown that in their natural environment the hominoid show sharply varying social structure gibbon are monogamous territorial orangutan are solitary gorilla live in small troop with a single adult male leader while chimpanzee live in larger troop with bonobo exhibiting promiscuous sexual behaviour their diet also vary gorilla are foliovores while the others are all primarily frugivores although the common chimpanzee doe some hunting for meat foraging behaviour is correspondingly variable diet apart from human and gorilla ape eat a predominantly frugivorous diet mostly fruit but supplemented with a variety of other food gorilla are predominately folivorous eating mostly stalk shoot root and leaf with some fruit and other food ape usually eat a small amount of raw animal food such a insect or egg in the case of human migration and the invention of hunting tool and cooking ha led to an even wider variety of food and diet with many human diet including large amount of cooked tuber root or legume other food production and processing method including animal husbandry and industrial refining and processing have further changed human diet human and other ape occasionally eat other primate some of these primate are now close to extinction with habitat loss being the underlying cause cognition all the hominoid are generally thought of a highly intelligent and scientific study ha broadly confirmed that they perform very well on a wide range of cognitive there is relatively little data on gibbon cognition the early study by wolfgang kohler demonstrated exceptional ability in chimpanzee which kohler attributed to insight the use of tool ha been repeatedly demonstrated more recently the manufacture of tool ha been documented both in the wild and in laboratory test imitation is much more easily demonstrated in great ape than in other primate specie almost all the study in animal language acquisition have been done with great ape and though there is continuing dispute a to whether they demonstrate real language ability there is no doubt that they involve significant feat of learning chimpanzee in different part of africa have developed tool that are used in food acquisition demonstrating a form of animal culture history of hominoid taxonomy the history of hominoid taxonomy is complex and somewhat confusing recent evidence ha changed our understanding of the relationship between the hominoid especially regarding the human lineage and the traditionally used term have become somewhat confused competing approach to methodology and terminology are found among current scientific source over time authority have changed the name and the meaning of name of group and subgroup a new is new discovery of fossil and tool and of observation in the field plus continual comparison of anatomy and dna changed the understanding of relationship between hominoid there ha been a gradual demotion of human from being in the taxonomy to being one branch among many this recent turmoil of history illustrates the growing influence on all taxonomy of cladistics the science of classifying living thing strictly according to their line of descent today there are eight extant genus of hominoid they are the four genus in the family hominidae namely homo pan gorilla and pongo plus four genus in the family hylobatidae gibbon hylobates hoolock nomascus and symphalangus the two subspecies of hoolock gibbon were recently moved from the genus bunopithecus to the new genus hoolock and a specie a third specie wa described in january in carl linnaeus relying on or account placed a second specie in homo along with h sapiens homo troglodyte man although the term orang outang is listed a a variety homo sylvestris under this specie it is nevertheless not clear to which animal this name refers a linnaeus had no specimen to refer to hence no precise description linnaeus may have based homo troglodyte on report of mythical creature simian or asian native dressed in animal skin linnaeus named the orangutan simia satyrus satyr monkey he placed the three genus homo simia and lemur in the order of primate the troglodyte name wa used for the chimpanzee by blumenbach in but moved to the genus simia the orangutan wa moved to the genus pongo in by lacepede linnaeus inclusion of human in the primate with monkey and ape wa troubling for people who denied a close relationship between human and the rest of the animal kingdom linnaeus lutheran archbishop had accused him of impiety in a letter to johann georg gmelin dated february linnaeus wrote it is not pleasing to me that i must place human among the primate but man is intimately familiar with himself let not quibble over word it will be the same to me whatever name is applied but i desperately seek from you and from the whole world a general difference between men and simian from the principle of natural history i certainly know of none if only someone might tell me one if i called man a simian or vice versa i would bring together all the theologian against me perhaps i ought to in accordance with the law of natural historyaccordingly johann friedrich blumenbach in the first edition of his manual of natural history proposed that the primate be divided into the quadrumana ie ape and monkey and bimana ie human this distinction wa taken up by other naturalist most notably george cuvier some elevated the distinction to the level of order however the many affinity between human and other primate and especially the great ape made it clear that the distinction made no scientific sense in the descent of man charles darwin wrote the greater number of naturalist who have taken into consideration the whole structure of man including his mental faculty have followed blumenbach and cuvier and have placed man in a separate order under the title of the bimana and therefore on an equality with the order of the quadrumana carnivora etc recently many of our best naturalist have recurred to the view first propounded by linnaeus so remarkable for his sagacity and have placed man in the same order with the quadrumana under the title of the primate the justice of this conclusion will be admitted for in the first place we must bear in mind the comparative insignificance for classification of the great development of the brain in man and that the strongly marked difference between the skull of man and the quadrumana lately insisted upon by bischoff aeby and others apparently follow from their differently developed brain in the second place we must remember that nearly all the other and more important difference between man and the quadrumana are manifestly adaptive in their nature and relate chiefly to the erect position of man such a the structure of his hand foot and pelvis the curvature of his spine and the position of his head change in taxonomy and terminology hominid v hominin see also note reference external link data
