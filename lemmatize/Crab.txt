crab are decapod crustacean of the infraorder brachyura which typically have a very short projecting tail abdomen greek brakhus romanized brachys short oura oura tail usually hidden entirely under the thorax they live in all the world ocean in fresh water and on land are generally covered with a thick exoskeleton and have a single pair of pincer many other animal with similar name such a hermit crab king crab porcelain crab horseshoe crab and crab louse are not true crab description crab are generally covered with a thick exoskeleton composed primarily of highly mineralized chitin and armed with a single pair of chela claw crab are found in all of the world ocean while many crab live in fresh water and on land particularly in tropical region crab vary in size from the pea crab a few millimeter wide to the japanese spider crab with a leg span up to m ft environment about specie are saltwater crab brackish water crab freshwater crab terrestrial crab or semiterrestrial crabsthey are found throughout the world tropical and semitropical region they were previously thought to be a monophyletic group but are now believed to represent at least two distinct lineage one in the old world and one in the new world evolution the earliest unambiguous crab fossil date from the jurassic although carboniferous imocaris known only from it carapace may be a primitive crab the radiation of crab in the cretaceous and afterward may be linked either to the of gondwana or to the concurrent radiation of bony fish crab main predator sexual dimorphism crab often show marked sexual dimorphism male often have larger claw a tendency that is particularly pronounced in the fiddler crab of the genus uca ocypodidae in fiddler crab male have one greatly enlarged claw used for communication particularly for attracting a mate another conspicuous difference is the form of the pleon abdomen in most male crab this is narrow and triangular in form while female have a broader rounded abdomen this is because female crab brood fertilised egg on their pleopod reproduction and lifecycle crab attract a mate through chemical pheromone visual acoustic or vibratory mean pheromone are used by most fully aquatic crab while terrestrial and semiterrestrial crab often use visual signal such a fiddler crab male waving their large claw to attract female the vast number of brachyuran crab have internal fertilisation and mate for many aquatic specie mating take place just after the female ha moulted and is still soft female can store the sperm for a long time before using it to fertilise their egg when fertilisation ha taken place the egg are released onto the female abdomen below the tail flap secured with a sticky material in this location they are protected during embryonic development female carrying egg are called berried since the egg resemble round berry when development is complete the female release the newly hatched larva into the water where they are part of the plankton the release is often timed with the tide the tiny zoea larva can float and take advantage of water current they have a spine which probably reduces the rate of predation by larger animal the zoea of most specie must find food but some crab provide enough yolk in the egg that the larval stage can continue to live off the yolk each specie ha a particular number of zoeal stage separated by moult before they change into a megalopa stage which resembles an adult crab except for having the abdomen tail sticking out behind after one more moult the crab is a juvenile living on the bottom rather than floating in the water this last moult from megalopa to juvenile is critical and it must take place in a habitat that is suitable for the juvenile to survivemost specie of terrestrial crab must migrate down to the ocean to release their larva in some case this entail very extensive migration after living for a short time a larva in the ocean the juvenile must do this migration in reverse in many tropical area with land crab these migration often result in considerable roadkill of migrating crabsonce crab have become juvenile they still have to keep moulting many more time to become adult they are covered with a hard shell which would otherwise prevent growth the moult cycle is coordinated by hormone when preparing for moult the old shell is softened and partly eroded away while the rudimentary beginning of a new shell form under it at the time of moulting the crab take in a lot of water to expand and crack open the old shell at a line of weakness along the back edge of the carapace the crab must then extract all of itself including it leg mouthpart eyestalks and even the lining of the front and back of the digestive tract from the old shell this is a difficult process that take many hour and if a crab get stuck it will die after freeing itself from the old shell now called an exuvia the crab is extremely soft and hide until it new shell ha hardened while the new shell is still soft the crab can expand it to make room for future growth behaviour crab typically walk sideways a behaviour which give u the word crabwise because of the articulation of the leg which make a sidelong gait more efficient however some crab walk forward or backwards including raninids libinia emarginata and mictyris platycheles some crab notably the portunidae and matutidae are also capable of swimming the portunidae especially so a their last pair of walking leg is flattened into swimming paddlescrabs are mostly active animal with complex behaviour pattern they can communicate by drumming or waving their pincer crab tend to be aggressive towards one another and male often fight to gain access to female on rocky seashore where nearly all cave and crevice are occupied crab may also fight over hiding hole fiddler crab genus uca dig burrow in sand or mud which they use for resting hiding and mating and to defend against intruderscrabs are omnivore feeding primarily on algae and taking any other food including mollusc worm other crustacean fungi bacteria and detritus depending on their availability and the crab specie for many crab a mixed diet of plant and animal matter result in the fastest growth and greatest fitness however some specie are more specialised in their diet some eat plankton some eat primarily shellfish such a clam and some even catch fishcrabs are known to work together to provide food and protection for their family and during mating season to find a comfortable spot for the female to release her egg human consumption fishery crab make up of all marine crustacean caught farmed and consumed worldwide amounting to million tonne annually one specie portunus trituberculatus account for of that total other commercially important taxon include portunus pelagicus several specie in the genus chionoecetes the blue crab callinectes sapidus charybdis spp cancer pagurus the dungeness crab metacarcinus magister and scylla serrata each of which yield more than tonne annuallyin some crab specie meat is harvested by manually twisting and pulling off one or both claw and returning the live crab to the water in the belief the crab will survive and regenerate the claw cookery crab are prepared and eaten a a dish in many different way all over the world some specie are eaten whole including the shell such a crab with other specie just the claw or leg are eaten the latter is particularly common for larger crab such a the snow crab in many culture the roe of the female crab is also eaten which usually appears orange or yellow in fertile crab this is popular in southeast asian culture some mediterranean and northern european culture and on the east chesapeake and gulf coast of the united state in some region spice improve the culinary experience in southeast asia and the indosphere masala crab and chilli crab are example of heavily spiced dish in the chesapeake bay region blue crab is often steamed with old bay seasoning alaskan king crab or snow crab leg are usually simply boiled and served with garlic or lemon butter for the british dish dressed crab the crab meat is extracted and placed inside the hard shell one american way to prepare crab meat is by extracting it and adding varying amount of binder such a egg white cracker meal mayonnaise or mustard creating a crab cake crab can also be made into a bisque a global dish of french origin which in it authentic form includes in the broth the pulverized shell of the shellfish from which it is made imitation crab also called surimi is made from minced fish meat that is crafted and colored to resemble crab meat while it is sometimes disdained among some element of the culinary industry a an unacceptably substitute for real crab this doe not hinder it popularity especially a a sushi ingredient in japan and south korea and in home cooking where cost is often a chief concern indeed surimi is an important source of protein in most east and southeast asian culture appearing in staple ingredient such a fish ball and fish cake pain crab are often boiled alive in norwegian scientist concluded that crustacean could not feel pain however a study by bob elwood and mirjam appel of queen university in belfast found that hermit crab reacted to electric shock this may indicate that some crustacean are able to feel and remember pain classification the infraorder brachyura contains specie in family a many a the remainder of the decapoda the evolution of crab is characterised by an increasingly robust body and a reduction in the abdomen although many other group have undergone similar process carcinisation is most advanced in crab the telson is no longer functional in crab and the uropods are absent having probably evolved into small device for holding the reduced abdomen tight against the sternum in most decapod the gonopores sexual opening are found on the leg however since crab use the first two pair of pleopod abdominal appendage for sperm transfer this arrangement ha changed a the male abdomen evolved into a slimmer shape the gonopores have moved towards the midline away from the leg and onto the sternum a similar change occurred independently with the female gonopores the movement of the female gonopore to the sternum defines the clade eubrachyura and the later change in the position of the male gonopore defines the thoracotremata it is still a subject of debate whether a monophyletic group is formed by those crab where the female but not male gonopores are situated on the sternum superfamily number of extant and extinct specie are given in bracket the superfamily eocarcinoidea containing eocarcinus and platykotta wa formerly thought to contain the oldest crab it is now considered part of
