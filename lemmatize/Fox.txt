fox are small to omnivorous mammal belonging to several genus of the family canidae fox have a flattened skull upright triangular ear a pointed slightly upturned snout and a long bushy tail or brush twelve specie belong to the monophyletic true fox group of genus vulpes approximately another current or extinct specie are always or sometimes called fox these fox are either part of the paraphyletic group of the south american fox or of the outlying group which consists of the fox gray fox and island fox fox live on every continent except antarctica by far the most common and widespread specie of fox is the red fox vulpes vulpes with about recognized subspecies the global distribution of fox together with their widespread reputation for cunning ha contributed to their prominence in popular culture and folklore in many society around the world the hunting of fox with pack of hound long an established pursuit in europe especially in the british isle wa exported by european settler to various part of the new world etymology the word fox come from old english which derived from fuhsaz this in turn derives from meaning tail male fox are known a dog tod or reynard female a vixen and young a cub pup or kit though the latter name is not to be confused with a distinct specie called kit fox vixen is one of very few word in modern english that retains the middle english southern dialect v pronunciation instead of f ie northern english fox versus southern english vox a group of fox is referred to a a skulk leash or earth phylogenetic relationship within the canidae the result of dna analysis show several phylogenetic division the canid which include the kit fox vulpes velox red fox vulpes vulpes cape fox vulpes chama arctic fox vulpes lagopus and fennec fox vulpes zerda the canid genus canis cuon and lycaon including the dog canis lupus familiaris gray wolf canis lupus red wolf canis rufus eastern wolf canis lycaon coyote canis latrans golden jackal canis aureus ethiopian wolf canis simensis jackal canis mesomelas jackal canis adustus dhole cuon alpinus and african wild dog lycaon pictus the south american canid including the bush dog speothos venaticus hoary fox lycalopex uetulus fox cerdocyon thou and maned wolf chrysocyon brachyurus various monotypic taxon including the fox otocyon megalotis gray fox urocyon cinereoargenteus and raccoon dog nyctereutes procyonoides biology general morphology fox are generally smaller than some other member of the family canidae such a wolf and jackal while they may be larger than some within the family such a raccoon dog in the largest specie the red fox male weigh on average between and kilogram and pound while the smallest specie the fennec fox weighs just to kg to lb foxy feature typically include a triangular face pointed ear an elongated rostrum and a bushy tail fox are digitigrade they walk on their toe unlike most member of the family canidae fox have partially retractable claw fox vibrissa or whisker are black the whisker on the muzzle mystaciae vibrissa average millimetre inch long while the whisker everywhere else on the head average to be shorter in length whisker carpal vibrissa are also on the forelimb and average mm in long pointing downward and backward other physical characteristic vary according to habitat and adaptive significance pelage fox specie differ in fur color length and density coat color range from pearly white to to black flecked with white or grey on the underside fennec fox and other specie of fox adapted to life in the desert such a kit fox for example have large ear and short fur to aid in keeping the body cool arctic fox on the other hand have tiny ear and short limb a well a thick insulating fur which aid in keeping the body warm red fox by contrast have a typical auburn pelt the tail normally ending with a white marking a fox coat color and texture may vary due to the change in season fox pelt are richer and denser in the colder month and lighter in the warmer month to get rid of the dense winter coat fox moult once a year around april the process begin from the foot up the leg and then along the back coat color may also change a the individual age dentition a fox dentition like all other canid is i c pm m fox have six extra molar totalling in teeth fox have pronounced carnassial pair which is characteristic of a carnivore these pair consist of the upper premolar and the lower first molar and work together to shear tough material like flesh fox canine are pronounced also characteristic of a carnivore and are excellent in gripping prey behaviour in the wild the typical lifespan of a fox is one to three year although individual may live up to ten year unlike many canid fox are not always pack animal typically they live in small family group but some such a arctic fox are known to be solitaryfoxes are omnivore their diet is made up primarily of invertebrate such a insect and small vertebrate such a reptile and bird they may also eat egg and vegetation many specie are generalist predator but some such a the fox have more specialized diet most specie of fox consume around kg lb of food every day fox cache excess food burying it for later consumption usually under leaf snow or soil while hunting fox tend to use a particular pouncing technique such that they crouch down to camouflage themselves in the terrain and then use their hind leg to leap up with great force and land on top of their chosen prey using their pronounced canine teeth they can then grip the prey neck and shake it until it is dead or can be readily disemboweledthe gray fox is one of only two canine specie known to regularly climb tree the other is the raccoon dog sexual characteristic the male fox scrotum is held up close to the body with the testis inside even after they descend like other canine the male fox ha a baculum or penile bone the testis of red fox are smaller than those of arctic fox sperm formation in red fox begin in with the testicle attaining their greatest weight in are in heat for one to six day making their reproductive cycle twelve month long a with other canine the ovum are shed during estrus without the need for the stimulation of copulating once the egg is fertilized the vixen enters a period of gestation that can last from to day fox tend to have an average litter size of four to five with an percent success rate in becoming pregnant litter size can vary greatly according to specie and environment the arctic fox for example can have up to eleven kitsthe vixen usually ha six or eight mamma each teat ha to lactiferous duct which connect the mammary gland to the nipple allowing for milk to be carried to the nipple vocalization the fox vocal repertoire is vast whine made shortly after birth occurs at a high rate when kit are hungry and when their body temperature are low whining stimulates the mother to care for her young it also ha been known to stimulate the male fox into caring for his mate and kit yelp made about day later the kit whining turn into infantile bark yelp which occur heavily during play explosive call at the age of about one month the kit can emit an explosive call which is intended to be threatening to intruder or other cub a howl combative call in adult the explosive call becomes an combative call during any conflict a sharper bark growl an adult fox indication to their kit to feed or head to the adult location bark adult fox warn against intruder and in defense by barkingin the case of domesticated fox the whining seems to remain in adult individual a a sign of excitement and submission in the presence of their owner classification canid commonly known a fox include the following genus and specie conservation several fox specie are endangered in their native environment pressure placed on fox include habitat loss and being hunted for pelt other trade or control due in part to their opportunistic hunting style and industriousness fox are commonly resented a nuisance animal on the other hand fox while often considered pest themselves have been successfully employed to control pest on fruit farm while leaving the fruit intact island fox urocyon littoralis the island fox though considered a specie throughout the world is becoming increasingly endangered in it endemic environment of the california channel island a population on an island is smaller than those on the mainland because of limited resource like space food and shelter island population therefore are highly susceptible to external threat ranging from introduced predatory specie and human to extreme weather on the california channel island it wa found that the population of the island fox wa so low due to an outbreak of canine distemper virus from to a well a predation by golden eagle since the eagle have caused the population to decline by a much a because of the low number of fox the population went through an allee effect this is where at low enough density an individual fitness decrease conservationist therefore had to take healthy breeding pair out of the wild population to breed them in captivity until they had enough fox to release back into the wild nonnative grazers were also removed so that native plant would be able to grow back to their natural height thereby providing adequate cover and protection for the fox against golden eagle darwin fox pseudalopex fulvipes darwin fox is considered critically endangered because of their small known population of mature individual a well a their restricted distribution on the chilean mainland the population is limited to nahuelbuta national park and the surrounding valdivian rainforest similarly on chiloe island their population is limited to the forest that extend from the southernmost to the northwestern most part of the island though the nahuelbuta national park is protected of the specie live on chiloe island a major problem the specie face therefore is their dwindling limited habitat due to the cutting and burning of the unprotected forest because of deforestation the darwin fox habitat is shrinking allowing for their competitor chilla fox preferred habitat of open space to increase the darwin fox subsequently is being outcompeted another problem they face is their inability to fight off disease transmitted by the increasing number of pet dog to conserve these animal researcher suggest the need for the forest that link the nahuelbuta national park to the coast of chile and in turn chiloe island and it forest to be protected they also suggest that other forest around chile be examined to determine whether darwin fox have previously existed there or can live there in the future should the need to reintroduce the specie to those area arise and finally the researcher advise for the creation of a captive breeding program in chile because of the limited number of mature individual in the wild relationship with human fox are often considered pest or nuisance creature for their opportunistic attack on poultry and other small livestock fox attack on human are not common many fox adapt well to human environment with several specie classified a resident urban carnivore for their ability to sustain population entirely within urban boundary fox in urban area can live longer and can have smaller litter size than fox in area urban fox are ubiquitous in europe where they show altered behavior compared to fox including increased population density smaller territory and pack foraging fox have been introduced in numerous location with varying effect on indigenous flora and faunain some country fox are major predator of rabbit and hen population oscillation of these two specie were the first nonlinear oscillation studied and led to the derivation of the equation fox hunting fox hunting originated in the united kingdom in the century hunting with dog is now banned in the united kingdom though hunting without dog is still permitted red fox were introduced into australia in the early century for sport and have since become widespread through much of the country they have caused population decline among many native specie and prey on livestock especially new lamb fox hunting is practiced a recreation in several other country including canada france ireland italy russia united state and australia domestication there are many record of domesticated red fox and others but rarely of sustained domestication a recent and notable exception is the russian silver fox which resulted in visible and behavioral change and is a case study of an animal population modeling according to human domestication need the current group of domesticated silver fox are the result of nearly fifty year of experiment in the soviet union and russia to domesticate the silver morph of the red fox this selective breeding resulted in physical and behavioral trait appearing that are frequently seen in domestic cat dog and other animal such a pigmentation change floppy ear and curly tail notably the new fox became more tame allowing themselves to be petted whimpering to get attention and sniffing and licking their caretaker attack on human in the united kingdom a number of case of attack on human have been reported they often involved child or if there were gap in home through which fox could pas urban fox fox are among the comparatively few mammal which have been able to adapt themselves to a certain degree to living in urban mostly suburban human environment their omnivorous diet allows them to survive on discarded food waste and their skittish and often nocturnal nature mean that they are often able to avoid detection despite their larger size urban fox however have been identified a threat to cat and small dog and for this reason there is often pressure to exclude them from these environmentsthe san joaquin kit fox is a highly endangered specie that ha ironically become adapted to urban living in the san joaquin valley and salina valley of southern california it diet includes mouse ground squirrel rabbit hare bird egg and insect and it ha claimed habitat in open area golf course drainage basin and school ground in culture the fox appears in many culture usually in folklore however there are slight variation in their depiction in folklore in western folklore and also in persian folklore fox are depicted a a symbol of cunning and trickery a reputation derived especially from their reputed ability to evade hunter this is usually represented a a character possessing these trait these trait are used on a wide variety of character either making them a nuisance to the story a misunderstood hero or a devious villain in asian folklore fox are depicted a a familiar spirit possessed of magic power similar to western folklore fox are depicted a mischievous usually tricking other people with the ability to disguise a an attractive female human however there are other depiction of fox a a mystical sacred creature that can either bring wonder or ruin fox appear in chinese folklore literature and mythology in which depending on the tale can be a good or a bad omen the motif wa eventually introduced from chinese to japanese and korean culturesthe constellation vulpecula represents a fox note reference external link bbc wale nature fox video the fox website text on wikisource fox the
