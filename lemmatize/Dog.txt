the dog canis familiaris when considered a distinct specie or canis lupus familiaris when considered a subspecies of the wolf is a domesticated carnivore of the family canidae it is part of the canid and is the most widely abundant terrestrial carnivore the dog and the extant gray wolf are sister taxon a modern wolf are not closely related to the wolf that were first domesticated which implies that the direct ancestor of the dog is extinct the dog wa the first specie to be domesticated and ha been selectively bred over millennium for various behavior sensory capability and physical attributestheir long association with human ha led dog to be uniquely attuned to human behavior and they are able to thrive on a diet that would be inadequate for other canid dog vary widely in shape size and color they perform many role for human such a hunting herding pulling load protection assisting police and military companionship and more recently aiding disabled people and therapeutic role this influence on human society ha given them the sobriquet of man best friend taxonomy in the swedish botanist and zoologist carl linnaeus published in his systema naturae the binomial nomenclature or the naming of specie canis is the latin word meaning dog and under this genus he listed the carnivore including domestic dog wolf and jackal he classified the domestic dog a canis familiaris and on the next page he classified the wolf a canis lupus linnaeus considered the dog to be a separate specie from the wolf because of it cauda recurvata it upturning tail which is not found in any other canidin a study of mitochondrial dna indicated that the domestic dog may have originated from multiple grey wolf population with the dingo and new guinea singing dog breed having developed at a time when human population were more isolated from each other in the third edition of mammal specie of the world published in the mammalogist w christopher wozencraft listed under the wolf canis lupus it wild subspecies and proposed two additional subspecies familiaris linneaus domestic dog and dingo meyer domestic dog wozencraft included hallstromi the new guinea singing dog a a taxonomic synonym for the dingo wozencraft referred to the mdna study a one of the guide in forming his decision the inclusion of familiaris and dingo under a domestic dog clade ha been noted by other mammalogist this classification by wozencraft is debated among zoologistsin a workshop hosted by the survival commission canid specialist group considered the new guinea singing dog and the dingo to be feral dog canis familiaris and therefore should not be assessed for the iucn red list origin the origin of the domestic dog includes the dog genetic divergence from the wolf it domestication and it development into dog type and dog breed the dog is a member of the genus canis which form part of the canid and wa the first specie and the only large carnivore to have been domesticated genetic study comparing dog with modern wolf show reciprocal monophyly separate group which implies that dog are not genetically close to any living wolf and that their wild ancestor is extinct an extinct late pleistocene wolf may have been the ancestor of the dog with the dog similarity to the extant grey wolf being the result of genetic admixture between the two in a literature review of canid domestication stated that modern dog were not descended from the same canis lineage a modern wolf and proposes that dog may be descended from a pleistocene wolf closer in size to a village dogthe genetic divergence between dog and wolf occurred between and year ago just before or during the last glacial maximum year ago this timespan represents the upper for the commencement of domestication because it is the time of divergence and not the time of domestication which occurred later one of the most important transition in human history wa the domestication of animal which began with the association between wolf and more than year ago the archaeological record and genetic analysis show the remains of the dog buried beside human year ago to be the first undisputed dog with disputed remains occurring year ago biology anatomy domestic dog have been selectively bred for millennium for various behavior sensory capability and physical attribute modern dog breed show more variation in size appearance and behavior than any other domestic animal dog are predator and scavenger like many other predatory mammal the dog ha powerful muscle large and sharp claw and teeth fused wrist bone a cardiovascular system that support both sprinting and endurance and teeth for catching and tearing size and weight dog are highly variable in height and weight the smallest known adult dog wa a yorkshire terrier that stood only centimetre inch at the shoulder cm in in length along the and weighed only gram ounce the largest known dog wa a saint bernard which weighed kg lb and wa cm ft in from the snout to the tail the tallest dog is a great dane that stand cm ft in at the shoulder sens the dog sens include vision hearing sense of smell sense of taste touch and sensitivity to the earth magnetic field another study suggested that dog can see the earth magnetic field coat the coat of domestic dog are of two variety double being common with dog a well a wolf originating from colder climate made up of a coarse guard hair and a soft down hair or single with the topcoat only breed may have an occasional blaze stripe or star of white fur on their chest or undersideregarding coat appearance or health the coat can be maintained or affected by multiple nutrient present in the diet see coat dog for more information premature graying can occur in dog from a early a one year of age this ha been shown to be associated with impulsive behavior anxiety behavior fear of noise and fear of unfamiliar people or animal tail there are many different shape for dog tail straight straight up sickle curled or a with many canid one of the primary function of a dog tail is to communicate their emotional state which can be important in getting along with others in some hunting dog however the tail is traditionally docked to avoid injury in some breed such a the braque du bourbonnais puppy can be born with a short tail or no tail at all difference from wolf despite their close genetic relationship and the ability to there are a number of diagnostic feature to distinguish the gray wolf from domestic dog domesticated dog are clearly distinguishable from wolf by starch gel electrophoresis of red blood cell acid phosphatase the tympanic bulla are large convex and almost spherical in gray wolf while the bulla of dog are smaller compressed and slightly crumpled compared with equally sized wolf dog tend to have smaller skull and smaller brain the teeth of gray wolf are also proportionately larger than those of dog dog have a more domed forehead and a distinctive stop between forehead and nose the temporalis muscle that close the jaw is more robust in wolf wolf do not have dewclaws on their back leg unless there ha been admixture with dog that had them most dog lack a functioning gland and enter estrus twice yearly unlike gray wolf which only do so once a year primitive dog such a dingo and basenji retain the yearly estrus cycledogs generally have brown eye and wolf almost always have amber or light colored eye the skin of domestic dog tends to be thicker than that of wolf with some inuit tribe favoring the former for use a clothing due to it greater resistance to wear and tear in harsh weather the paw of a dog are half the size of those of a wolf and their tail tend to curl upwards another trait not found in wolf the dog ha developed into hundred of varied breed and show more behavioral and morphological variation than any other land mammal health there are many household plant that are poisonous to dog and other mammal including begonia poinsettia and aloe verasome breed of dog are prone to certain genetic ailment such a elbow and hip dysplasia blindness deafness pulmonic stenosis cleft palate and trick knee two serious medical condition particularly affecting dog are pyometra affecting unspayed female of all type and age and gastric dilatation volvulus bloat which affect the larger breed or dog both of these are acute condition and can kill rapidly dog are also susceptible to parasite such a flea tick mite hookworm tapeworm roundworm and heartworms roundworm specie that life in the heart of dog a number of common human food and household ingestibles are toxic to dog including chocolate solid theobromine poisoning onion and garlic thiosulphate sulfoxide or disulfide poisoning grape and raisin macadamia nut xylitol a well a various plant and other potentially ingested material the nicotine in tobacco can also be dangerous dog can be exposed to the substance by scavenging through garbage bin or ashtray and eating cigar and cigarette sign can be vomiting of large amount eg from eating cigar butt or diarrhea some other sign are abdominal pain loss of coordination collapse or death dog are susceptible to theobromine poisoning typically from ingestion of chocolate theobromine is toxic to dog because although the dog metabolism is capable of breaking down the chemical the process is so slow that for some dog even small amount of chocolate can be fatal especially dark chocolate dog are also vulnerable to some of the same health condition a human including diabetes dental and heart disease epilepsy cancer hypothyroidism and arthritis lifespan in a study found that mixed breed live on average year longer than pure breed and that increasing wa negatively correlated with longevity ie the heavier the dog the shorter it lifespan the typical lifespan of dog varies widely among breed but for most the median longevity the age at which half the dog in a population have died and half are still alive range from to year individual dog may live well beyond the median of their breed the breed with the shortest lifespan among breed for which there is a questionnaire survey with a reasonable sample size is the dogue de bordeaux with a median longevity of about year but several breed including miniature bull terrier bloodhound and irish wolfhound are nearly a with median longevity of to yearsthe breed including toy poodle japanese spitz border terrier and tibetan spaniel have median longevity of to year the median longevity of dog taken a an average of all size is one or more year longer than that of purebred dog when all breed are averaged the dog wa bluey an australian cattle dog who died in at year of age reproduction in domestic dog sexual maturity happens around six to twelve month of age for both male and female although this can be delayed until up to two year old for some large breed this is the time at which female dog will have their first estrous cycle they will experience subsequent estrous cycle semiannually during which the body prepares for pregnancy at the peak of the cycle female will come into estrus being mentally and physically receptive to copulation because the ovum survive and are capable of being fertilized for a week after ovulation it is possible for more than one male to sire the same litterfertilization typically occurs day after ovulation day after ovulation the embryo attache to the uterus and after more day the heart beat is detectabledogs bear their litter roughly to day after fertilization with an average of day although the length of gestation can vary an average litter consists of about six puppy though this number may vary widely based on the breed of dog in general toy dog produce from one to four puppy in each litter while much larger breed may average a many a twelve some dog breed have acquired trait through selective breeding that interfere with reproduction male french bulldog for instance are incapable of mounting the female for many dog of this breed the female must be artificially inseminated in order to reproduce neutering neutering refers to the sterilization of animal usually by removal of the male testicle or the female ovary and uterus in order to eliminate the ability to procreate and reduce sex drive because of the overpopulation of dog in some country many animal control agency such a the american society for the prevention of cruelty to animal aspca advise that dog not intended for further breeding should be neutered so that they do not have undesired puppy that may later be euthanizedaccording to the humane society of the united state million dog and cat are euthanized each year in the united state and many more are confined to cage in shelter because there are many more animal than there are home spaying or castrating dog help keep overpopulation down local humane society spcas and other animal protection organization urge people to neuter their pet and to adopt animal from shelter instead of purchasing them neutering reduces problem caused by hypersexuality especially in male dog spayed female dog are le likely to develop some form of cancer affecting mammary gland ovary and other reproductive organ however neutering increase the risk of urinary incontinence in female dog and prostate cancer in male a well a osteosarcoma hemangiosarcoma cruciate ligament rupture obesity and diabetes mellitus in either sex inbreeding depression a common breeding practice for pet dog is mating between close relative eg between and full sibling inbreeding depression is considered to be due largely to the expression of homozygous deleterious recessive mutation outcrossing between unrelated individual including dog of different breed result in the beneficial masking of deleterious recessive mutation in progenyin a study of seven breed of dog bernese mountain dog basset hound cairn terrier epagneul breton german shepherd dog leonberger and west highland white terrier it wa found that inbreeding decrease litter size and survival another analysis of data on dachshund litter found that a the inbreeding coefficient increased litter size decreased and the percentage of stillborn puppy increased thus indicating inbreeding depression in a study of boxer litter of puppy died before reaching week of age stillbirth wa the most frequent cause of death followed by infection mortality due to infection increased significantly with increase in inbreeding intelligence behavior and communication intelligence dog intelligence is the ability of the dog to perceive information and retain it a knowledge for applying to solve problem study of two dog suggest that dog can learn by inference and have advanced memory skill a study with rico a border collie showed that he knew the label of over different item he inferred the name of novel item by exclusion learning and correctly retrieved those novel item immediately and also week after the initial exposure a study of another border collie chaser documented his learning and memory capability he had learned the name and could associate by verbal command over word dog are able to read and react appropriately to human body language such a gesturing and pointing and to understand human voice command a study on canine cognitive ability found that dog capability are no more exceptional than those of other animal such a horse chimpanzee or cat various animal including pig pigeon and chimpanzee are able to remember the what where and when of an event which dog can not dodogs demonstrate a theory of mind by engaging in deception an experimental study showed compelling evidence that australian dingo can outperform domestic dog in indicating that domestic dog may have lost much of their original ability once they joined human another study indicated that after undergoing training to solve a simple manipulation task dog that are faced with an insoluble version of the same problem look at the human while socialized wolf do not behavior dog behavior is the internally coordinated response action or inaction of the domestic dog individual or group to internal external stimulus a the oldest domesticated specie with estimate ranging from year bce the mind of dog inevitably have been shaped by millennium of contact with human a a result of this physical and social evolution dog more than any other specie have acquired the ability to understand and communicate with human and they are uniquely attuned to human behavior behavioral scientist have uncovered a surprising set of ability in the domestic dog these ability are not possessed by the dog closest canine relative nor by other highly intelligent mammal such a great ape but rather parallel some of the skill of human childrenunlike other domestic specie which were primarily selected for trait dog were initially selected for their behavior in a study found that there were only fixed gene that showed variation between wolf and dog these gene variation were unlikely to have been the result of natural evolution and indicate selection on both morphology and behavior during dog domestication these gene have been shown to affect the catecholamine synthesis pathway with the majority of the gene affecting the response ie selection for tameness and emotional processing dog generally show reduced fear and aggression compared with wolf some of these gene have been associated with aggression in some dog breed indicating their importance in both the initial domestication and then later in breed formation trait of high sociability and lack of fear in dog may include genetic modification related to syndrome in human which cause hypersociability at the expense of problem solving ability communication dog communication is how dog convey information to other dog how they understand message from human and how human translate the information that dog are transmitting communication behavior of dog include eye gaze facial expression vocalization body posture including movement of body and limb and gustatory communication scent pheromone and taste human communicate to dog by using vocalization hand signal and body posture ecology population in an estimate of the global dog population wa between million and million although it is said that the dog is man best friend this refers largely to the of dog that live in developed country in the developing world dog are more commonly feral or communally owned with pet dog uncommon most of these dog live their life a scavenger and have never been owned by human with one study showing their most common response when approached by stranger is to run away or respond aggressively little is known about these dog or the dog in developed country that are feral stray or are in shelter because the great majority of modern research on dog cognition ha focused on pet dog living in human home competitor and predator although dog are the most abundant and widely distributed terrestrial carnivore the potential of feral and dog to compete with other large carnivore is limited by their strong association with human for example a review of the study in the competitive effect of dog on sympatric carnivore did not mention any research on competition between dog and wolf although wolf are known to kill dog they tend to live in pair or in small pack in area where they are highly persecuted giving them a disadvantage facing large dog groupswolves kill dog wherever they are found together one study reported that in wisconsin in more compensation had been paid for loss due to wolf taking dog than for wolf taking livestock in wisconsin wolf will often kill hunting dog possibly because the dog are in the wolf territory a strategy ha been reported in russia where one wolf lure a dog into heavy brush where another wolf wait in ambush in some instance wolf have displayed an uncharacteristic fearlessness of human and building when attacking dog to the extent that they have to be beaten off or killed although the number of dog killed each year are relatively low it induces a fear of wolf entering village and farmyard to take dog and loss of dog to wolf ha led to demand for more liberal wolf hunting regulationscoyotes and big cat have also been known to attack dog leopard in particular are known to have a predilection for dog and have been recorded to kill and consume them regardless of their size tiger in manchuria indochina indonesia and malaysia are also reported to kill dog striped hyena are known to kill dog in turkmenistan india and the caucasusdogs are normal prey for the american alligator diet dog have been described a carnivore or omnivore compared to wolf dog from agricultural society have extra copy of amylase and other gene involved in starch digestion that contribute to an increased ability to thrive on a diet also like human some dog breed produce amylase in their saliva based on metabolism and nutrition many consider the dog to be an omnivorehowever the dog is not simply an omnivore more like the cat and le like other omnivore the dog can only produce bile acid with taurine and it can not produce vitamin d which it obtains from animal flesh also more like the cat the dog requires arginine to maintain it nitrogen balance these nutritional requirement place the dog between carnivore and omnivore range a a domesticated or animal the dog is nearly universal among human society notable exception once included aboriginal tasmanians who were separated from australia before the arrival of dingo on that continent the andamanese who were isolated when rising sea level covered the land bridge to myanmar the fuegians who instead domesticated the fuegian dog a different canid specie certain pacific island whose maritime settler did not bring dog or where dog died out after original settlement notably the mariana island palau marshall island gilbert island new caledonia vanuatu tonga marquesas mangaia in the cook island rapa iti in french polynesia easter island chatham island and pitcairn island settled by the bounty mutineer who killed off their dog in order to escape discovery by passing ship dog were introduced to antarctica a sled dog but were later outlawed by international agreement due to the possible risk of spreading infection breed the domestic dog is the first specie and the only large carnivore known to have been domesticated especially over the past year dog have undergone rapid phenotypic change and were formed into today modern dog breed due to artificial selection by human these breed can vary in size and weight from a kg lb teacup poodle to a kg lb giant mastiff phenotypic variation can include height measured to the withers ranging from cm in in the chihuahua to cm in in the irish wolfhound color varies from white through gray usually called blue to black and brown from light tan to dark red or chocolate in a wide variation of pattern coat can be short or long to straight curly or smooth the skull body and limb proportion vary significantly between breed with dog displaying more phenotypic diversity than can be found within the entire order of carnivore some breed demonstrate outstanding skill in herding retrieving scent detection and guarding which demonstrates the functional and behavioral diversity of dog the first dog were domesticated from shared ancestor of modern wolf however the phenotypic change that coincided with the genetic divergence are not known role with human domestic dog inherited complex behavior such a bite inhibition from their wolf ancestor which would have been pack hunter with complex body language these sophisticated form of social cognition and communication may account for their trainability playfulness and ability to fit into human household and social situation and these attribute have given dog a relationship with human that ha enabled them to become one of the most successful specie on the planet todaythe dog value to early human led to them quickly becoming ubiquitous across world culture dog perform many role for people such a hunting herding pulling load protection assisting police and military companionship and more recently aiding handicapped individual this influence on human society ha given them the nickname man best friend in the western world in some culture however dog are also a source of meat early role wolf and their dog descendant likely derived significant benefit from living in human camp more safety more reliable food lesser caloric need and more chance to breed they would have benefited from human upright gait that give them larger range over which to see potential predator and prey a well a better color vision that at least by day give human better visual discrimination camp dog would also have benefited from human tool use a in bringing down larger prey and controlling fire for a range of purposeshumans would also have derived enormous benefit from the dog associated with their camp for instance dog would have improved sanitation by cleaning up food scrap dog may have provided warmth a referred to in the australian aboriginal expression three dog night an exceptionally cold night and they would have alerted the camp to the presence of predator or stranger using their acute hearing to provide an early warningit ha been suggested that the most significant benefit would have been the use of dog robust sense of smell to assist with the hunt the relationship between the presence of a dog and success in the hunt is often mentioned a a primary reason for the domestication of the wolf and a study of hunter group with and without a dog give quantitative support to the hypothesis that the benefit of cooperative hunting wa an important factor in wolf domesticationthe cohabitation of dog and human likely improved the chance of survival for early human group and the domestication of dog may have been one of the key force that led to human successhuman emigrant from siberia that came across the bering land bridge into north america likely had dog in their company although one writer even suggests that the use of sled dog may have been critical to the success of the wave that entered north america roughly year ago the earliest archaeological evidence of canid in north america date from about year ago dog were an important part of life for the athabascan population in north america and were their only domesticated animal dog a pack animal may have contributed to the migration of the apache and navajo tribe year ago this use of dog in these culture often persisted after the introduction of the horse to north america a pet it is estimated that of the world dog population life in the developing world a feral village or community dog with pet dog uncommon the most widespread form of interspecies bonding occurs between human and dog and the keeping of dog a companion particularly by elite ha a long history see the dog population grew significantly after world war ii a suburbanization increased in the and dog were kept outside more often than they tend to be today the expression in the doghouse recorded since to describe exclusion from the group implies distance between the doghouse and the home and were still primarily functional acting a a guard child playmate or walking companion from the there have been change in the role of the pet dog such a the increased role of dog in the emotional support of their human guardian people and their dog have become increasingly integrated and implicated in each other life to the point where pet dog actively shape the way a family and home are experiencedthere have been two major trend occurring within the second half of the century in the changing status of pet dog the first ha been the commodification of the dog shaping it to conform to human expectation of personality and behaviour the second ha been the broadening of the concept of the family and the home to include within everyday routine and practicesa vast range of commodity form aim to transform a pet dog into an ideal companion the list of good service and place available is enormous from dog perfume couture furniture and housing to dog groomers therapist trainer and caretaker dog cafe spa park and beach and dog hotel airline and cemetery while dog training a an organized activity ha operated since the century in the last decade of the century it became a issue a many normal dog behavior such a barking jumping up digging rolling in dung fighting and urine marking which dog do to establish territory through scent became increasingly incompatible with the new role of a pet dog dog training book class and television program proliferated a the process of commodifying the pet dog continuedthe majority of contemporary describe their pet a part of the family although some ambivalence about the relationship is evident in the popular reconceptualization of the family a a pack some such a on the television program dog whisperer have promoted a of relationship however it ha been disputed that trying to achieve status is characteristic of interaction pet dog play an active role in family life for example a study of conversation in family showed how family member use the dog a a resource talking to the dog or talking through the dog to mediate their interaction with each otherincreasingly human engage in activity centered on the perceived need and interest of the dog or in which the dog is an integral partner such a dog dancing and dog yogaaccording to statistic published by the american pet product manufacturer association in the national pet owner survey in an estimated million people in the united state have pet dog the same source show that nearly of american household own at least one dog of which own just one dog two dog and nearly more than two dog there doe not seem to be any gender preference among dog a pet a the statistical data reveal an equal number of female and male dog pet although several program promote pet adoption le than a fifth of the owned dog come from a shelter some research suggests that a pet dog produce a considerable carbon footprinta study using magnetic resonance imaging mri to compare human and dog showed that dog have the same response to voice and use the same part of the brain a human do this give dog the ability to recognize emotional human sound making them friendly social pet to human work dog have lived and worked with human in many role in addition to dog role a companion animal dog have been bred for herding livestock collie sheepdog hunting hound pointer and rodent control terrier other type of working dog include search and rescue dog detection dog trained to detect illicit drug or chemical weapon guard dog dog who assist fisherman with the use of net and dog that pull load in the dog laika became the first animal to be launched into earth orbit aboard the soviet sputnik she died during the flightvarious kind of service dog and assistance dog including guide dog hearing dog mobility assistance dog and psychiatric service dog provide assistance to individual with disability some dog owned by epileptic have been shown to alert their handler when the handler show sign of an impending seizure sometimes well in advance of onset allowing the guardian to seek safety medication or medical care sport and show people often enter their dog in competition such a show or sport including racing sledding and agility competition in conformation show also referred to a breed show a judge familiar with the specific dog breed evaluates individual purebred dog for conformity with their established breed type a described in the breed standard a the breed standard only deal with the externally observable quality of the dog such a appearance movement and temperament separately tested quality such a ability or health are not part of the judging in conformation show a food dog meat is consumed in some east asian country including korea china and vietnam a practice that date back to antiquity it is estimated that million dog are killed and consumed in asia every year in china debate have ensued over banning the consumption of dog meat following the sui and tang dynasty of the first millennium however people living on the plain of northern china began to eschew eating dog this is likely due to the spread of buddhism and islam two religion that forbade the consumption of certain animal including dog a member of the upper class shunned dog meat it gradually became a social taboo to eat it despite the fact that the general population continued to consume it for century afterward other culture such a polynesia and mexico also consumed dog meat in their history however western south asian african and middle eastern culture in general regard consumption of dog meat a taboo in some place however such a in rural area of poland dog fat is believed to have medicinal property being good for the lung for instance dog meat is also consumed in some part of switzerland proponent of eating dog meat have argued that placing a distinction between livestock and dog is western hypocrisy and that there is no difference with eating the meat of different animalsin korea the primary dog breed raised for meat the nureongi nureongi differs from those breed raised for pet that korean may keep in their homesthe most popular korean dog dish is also called bosintang a spicy stew meant to balance the body heat during the summer month follower of the custom claim this is done to ensure good health by balancing one gi or vital energy of the body a century version of explains that the dish is prepared by boiling dog meat with scallion and chili powder variation of the dish contain chicken and bamboo shoot while the dish are still popular in korea with a segment of the population dog is not a widely consumed a beef chicken and pork health risk to human in the who reported that people died in asia and africa from rabies a disease for which dog are the most important vectorciting a study the u center for disease control estimated in that million people in the usa are bitten by dog each year a study estimated that of the u population is bitten each year in the and the u averaged fatality per year while since this ha increased to an average of of dog bite are from the pet of family or friend and of attack occur on the property of the dog legal ownera colorado study found bite in child were le severe than bite in adult the incidence of dog bite in the u is per inhabitant but for boy aged to the incidence rate is per moreover child have a much higher chance to be bitten in the face or neck sharp claw with powerful muscle behind them can lacerate flesh in a scratch that can lead to serious infectionsin the uk between and there were dog attack on human resulting in working day lost in sick leavein the united state cat and dog are a factor in more than fall each year it ha been estimated around of injury treated in uk hospital are domestic accident the same study found that while dog involvement in road traffic accident wa difficult to quantify road accident involving injury more commonly involved vehiclestoxocara canis dog roundworm egg in dog feces can cause toxocariasis in the united state about case of toxocara infection are reported in human each year and almost of the u population is infected in great britain of soil sample taken from public park contained t canis egg untreated toxocariasis can cause retinal damage and decreased vision dog feces can also contain hookworm that cause cutaneous larva migrans in human health benefit for human dog suffer from the same common disorder a human these includes cancer diabetes heart disease and neurologic disorder the pathology is similar to human a is their response to treatment and their final outcome researcher are now identifying the gene associated with dog disease that are similar to human disorder but which lack mouse model in order to find treatment for both dog and human the gene which are involved in canine obsessive compulsive disorder led to the detection of four gene in related pathway in humansthe scientific evidence is mixed a to whether companionship of a dog can enhance human physical health and psychological wellbeing study suggesting that there are benefit to physical health and psychological wellbeing have been criticised for being poorly controlled and finding that the health of elderly people is related to their health habit and social support but not to their ownership of or attachment to a companion animal earlier study have shown that people who keep pet dog or cat exhibit better mental and physical health than those who do not making fewer visit to the doctor and being le likely to be on medication than paper state recent research ha failed to support earlier finding that pet ownership is associated with a reduced risk of cardiovascular disease a reduced use of general practitioner service or any psychological or physical benefit on health for community dwelling older people research ha however pointed to significantly le absenteeism from school through sickness among child who live with pet in one study new guardian reported a highly significant reduction in minor health problem during the first month following pet acquisition and this effect wa sustained in those with dog through to the end of the studyin addition people with pet dog took considerably more physical exercise than those with cat and those without pet the result provide evidence that keeping pet may have positive effect on human health and behaviour and that for guardian of dog these effect are relatively pet guardianship ha also been associated with increased coronary artery disease survival with human guardian being significantly le likely to die within one year of an acute myocardial infarction than those who did not own dogsthe health benefit of dog can result from contact with dog in general and not solely from having dog a pet for example when in the presence of a pet dog people show reduction in cardiovascular behavioral and psychological indicator of anxiety other health benefit are gained from exposure to microorganism which according to the hygiene hypothesis can protect against allergy and autoimmune disease the benefit of contact with a dog also include social support a dog are able to not only provide companionship and social support themselves but also to act a facilitator of social interaction between human one study indicated that wheelchair user experience more positive social interaction with stranger when they are accompanied by a dog than when they are not in a study found that pet owner were significantly more likely to get to know people in their neighborhood than ownersthe practice of using dog and other animal a a part of therapy date back to the late century when animal were introduced into mental institution to help socialize patient with mental disorder intervention research ha shown that therapy with a dog can increase social behavior such a smiling and laughing among people with alzheimer disease one study demonstrated that child with adhd and conduct disorder who participated in an education program with dog and other animal showed increased attendance increased knowledge and skill objective and decreased antisocial and violent behavior compared with those who were not in an program shelter every year between and million dog and cat enter u animal shelter the humane society of the united state hsus estimate that approximately to million of those dog and cat are euthanized yearly in the united state however the percentage of dog in u animal shelter that are eventually adopted and removed from the shelter by their new legal owner ha increased since the from around to a average of among reporting shelter with many shelter reporting terminology the term dog typically is applied both to the specie or subspecies a a whole and any adult male member of the same an adult female is a bitch an adult male capable of reproduction is a stud an adult female capable of reproduction is a brood bitch or brood mother immature male or female that is animal that are incapable of reproduction are pup or puppy a group of pup from the same gestation period is called a litter the father of a litter is a sire it is possible for one litter to have multiple sire the mother of a litter is a dam a group of any three or more adult is a pack cultural depiction in china korea and japan dog are viewed a kind protector mythology and religion in ancient mesopotamia from the old babylonian period until the dog were the symbol of ninisina the goddess of healing and medicine and her worshipper frequently dedicated small model of seated dog to her in the and period dog were used a emblem of magical protectionin mythology dog often serve a pet or a watchdog story of dog guarding the gate of the underworld recur throughout mythology and may originate from religion in greek mythology cerberus is a watchdog who guard the gate of hades in norse mythology a bloody dog called garmr guard helheim in persian mythology two dog guard the chinvat bridge in welsh mythology annwn
