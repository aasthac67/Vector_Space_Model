score run by striking the ball bowled at the wicket with the bat and running between the wicket while the bowling and fielding side try to prevent this by getting the ball to either wicket and dismiss each batter so they are out mean of dismissal include being bowled when the ball hit the stump and dislodges the bail and by the fielding side catching the ball after it is hit by the bat but before it hit the ground when ten batter have been dismissed the inning end and the team swap role the game is adjudicated by two umpire aided by a third umpire and match referee in international match they communicate with two scorer who record the match statistical information form of cricket range from with each team batting for a single inning of over to test match played over five day traditionally cricketer play in kit but in limited over cricket they wear club or team colour in addition to the basic kit some player wear protective gear to prevent injury caused by the ball which is a hard solid spheroid made of compressed leather with a slightly raised sewn seam enclosing a cork core layered with tightly wound string the earliest reference to cricket is in south east england in the century it spread globally with the expansion of the british empire with the first international match in the second half of the century the game governing body is the international cricket council icc which ha over member twelve of which are full member who play test match the game rule the law of cricket are maintained by marylebone cricket club mcc in london the sport is followed primarily in the indian subcontinent australasia the united kingdom southern africa and the west indie woman cricket which is organised and played separately ha also achieved international standard the most successful side playing international cricket is australia which ha won seven one day international trophy including five world cup more than any other country and ha been the test side more than any other country history origin cricket is one of many game in the club ball sphere that basically involve hitting a ball with a implement others include baseball golf hockey tennis squash badminton and table tennis in cricket case a key difference is the existence of a solid target structure the wicket originally it is thought a wicket gate through which sheep were herded that the batsman must defend the cricket historian harry altham identified three group of club ball game the hockey group in which the ball is driven to and fro between two target the goal the golf group in which the ball is driven towards an undefended target the hole and the cricket group in which the ball is aimed at a mark the wicket and driven away from it it is generally believed that cricket originated a a child game in the county of england sometime during the medieval period although there are claim for prior date the earliest definite reference to cricket being played come from evidence given at a court case in guildford on monday january julian calendar equating to january in the gregorian calendar the case concerned ownership of a certain plot of land and the court heard the testimony of a coroner john derrick who gave witness that being a scholler in the ffree schoole of guldeford hee and diverse of his fellow did runne and play there at creckett and other play given derrick age it wa about half a century earlier when he wa at school and so it is certain that cricket wa being played c by boy in surrey the view that it wa originally a child game is reinforced by randle cotgrave dictionary in which he defined the noun crosse a the crooked staff wherewith boy play at cricket and the verb form crosser a to play at cricket one possible source for the sport name is the old english word cryce or cricc meaning a crutch or staff in samuel johnson dictionary he derived cricket from cryce saxon a stick in old french the word criquet seems to have meant a kind of club or stick given the strong medieval trade connection between england and the county of flanders when the latter belonged to the duchy of burgundy the name may have been derived from the middle dutch in use in flanders at the time krick meaning a stick crook another possible source is the middle dutch word krickstoel meaning a long low stool used for kneeling in church and which resembled the long low wicket with two stump used in early cricket according to heiner gillmeister a european language expert of bonn university cricket derives from the middle dutch phrase for hockey met de krik ket sen ie with the stick chase gillmeister ha suggested that not only the name but also the sport itself may be of flemish origin growth of amateur and professional cricket in england although the main object of the game ha always been to score the most run the early form of cricket differed from the modern game in certain key technical aspect the ball wa bowled underarm by the bowler and along the ground towards a batsman armed with a bat that in shape resembled a hockey stick the batsman defended a low wicket and run were called notch because the scorer recorded them by notching tally sticksin the year cotgrave dictionary wa published ecclesiastical court record at sidlesham in sussex state that two parishioner bartholomew wyatt and richard latter failed to attend church on easter sunday because they were playing cricket they were fined each and ordered to do penance this is the earliest mention of adult participation in cricket and it wa around the same time that the earliest known organised or village match wa played at chevening kent in a player called jasper vinall died after he wa accidentally struck on the head during a match between two parish team in sussexcricket remained a local pursuit for much of the century it is known through numerous reference found in the record of ecclesiastical court case to have been proscribed at time by the puritan before and during the commonwealth the problem wa nearly always the issue of sunday play a the puritan considered cricket to be profane if played on the sabbath especially if large crowd or gambling were involvedaccording to the social historian derek birley there wa a great upsurge of sport after the restoration in gambling on sport became a problem significant enough for parliament to pas the gambling act limiting stake to which wa in any case a colossal sum exceeding the annual income of of the population along with prizefighting horse racing and blood sport cricket wa perceived to be a gambling sport rich patron made match for high stake forming team in which they engaged the first professional player by the end of the century cricket had developed into a major sport that wa spreading throughout england and wa already being taken abroad by english mariner and coloniser the earliest reference to cricket overseas is dated a newspaper report survives of a great cricket match played in sussex for fifty guinea apiece this is the earliest known contest that is generally considered a first class matchthe patron and other player from the social class known a the gentry began to classify themselves a amateur to establish a clear distinction from the professional who were invariably member of the working class even to the point of having separate changing and dining facility the gentry including such noble a the duke of richmond exerted their honour code of noblesse oblige to claim right of leadership in any sporting contest they took part in especially a it wa necessary for them to play alongside their social inferior if they were to win their bet in time a perception took hold that the typical amateur who played in cricket until when amateurism wa abolished wa someone with a public school education who had then gone to one of cambridge or oxford university society insisted that such people were officer and gentleman whose destiny wa to provide leadership in a purely financial sense the cricketing amateur would theoretically claim expense for playing while his professional counterpart played under contract and wa paid a wage or match fee in practice many amateur claimed more than actual expenditure and the derisive term shamateur wa coined to describe the practice english cricket in the and century the game underwent major development in the century to become england national sport it success wa underwritten by the twin necessity of patronage and betting cricket wa prominent in london a early a and in the middle year of the century large crowd flocked to match on the artillery ground in finsbury the single wicket form of the sport attracted huge crowd and wager to match it popularity peaking in the season bowling underwent an evolution around when bowler began to pitch the ball instead of rolling or skimming it towards the batsman this caused a revolution in bat design because to deal with the bouncing ball it wa necessary to introduce the modern straight bat in place of the old hockey stick shapethe hambledon club wa founded in the and for the next twenty year until the formation of marylebone cricket club mcc and the opening of lord old ground in hambledon wa both the game greatest club and it focal point mcc quickly became the sport premier club and the custodian of the law of cricket new law introduced in the latter part of the century included the three stump wicket and leg before wicket lbw the century saw underarm bowling superseded by first roundarm and then overarm bowling both development were controversial organisation of the game at county level led to the creation of the county club starting with sussex in in december the eight leading county club formed the official county championship which began in most famous player of the century wa w g grace who started his long and influential career in it wa especially during the career of grace that the distinction between amateur and professional became blurred by the existence of player like him who were nominally amateur but in term of their financial gain de facto professional grace himself wa said to have been paid more money for playing cricket than any professionalthe last two decade before the first world war have been called the golden age of cricket it is a nostalgic name prompted by the collective sense of loss resulting from the war but the period did produce some great player and memorable match especially a organised competition at county and test level developed cricket becomes an international sport meanwhile the british empire had been instrumental in spreading the game overseas and by the middle of the century it had become well established in australia the caribbean india new zealand north america and south africa in the international match took place between the united state and canada in a team of english player went to north america on the first overseas tourin an english team made the first tour of australia the first australian team to travel overseas consisted of aboriginal stockman who toured england in an england team took part in what wa retrospectively recognised a the test match at the melbourne cricket ground against australia the rivalry between england and australia gave birth to the ash in and this ha remained test cricket most famous contest test cricket began to expand in when south africa played england world cricket in the century the year were dominated by australia don bradman statistically the greatest test batsman of all time test cricket continued to expand during the century with the addition of the west indie new zealand and india before the second world war and then pakistan sri lanka zimbabwe bangladesh ireland and afghanistan both in the period south africa wa banned from international cricket from to a part of the apartheid boycott the rise of limited over cricket cricket entered a new era in when english county introduced the limited over variant a it wa sure to produce a result limited over cricket wa lucrative and the number of match increased the first limited over international wa played in and the governing international cricket council icc seeing it potential staged the first limited over cricket world cup in in the century a new limited over form made an immediate impact on june afghanistan and ireland became the and icc full member enabling them to play test cricket law and gameplay in cricket the rule of the game are specified in a code called the law of cricket hereinafter called the law which ha a global remit there are law always written with a capital l the earliest known version of the code wa drafted in and since it ha been owned and maintained by it custodian the marylebone cricket club mcc in london playing area cricket is a game played on a cricket field see image right between two team of eleven player each the field is usually circular or oval in shape and the edge of the playing area is marked by a boundary which may be a fence part of the stand a rope a painted line or a combination of these the boundary must if possible be marked along it entire lengthin the approximate centre of the field is a rectangular pitch see image below on which a wooden target called a wicket is sited at each end the wicket are placed yard m apart the pitch is a flat surface foot m wide with very short grass that tends to be worn away a the game progress cricket can also be played on artificial surface notably matting each wicket is made of three wooden stump topped by two bail a illustrated above the pitch is marked at each end with four white painted line a bowling crease a popping crease and two return crease the three stump are aligned centrally on the bowling crease which is eight foot eight inch long the popping crease is drawn four foot in front of the bowling crease and parallel to it although it is drawn a a line six foot either side of the wicket it is in fact unlimited in length the return crease are drawn at right angle to the popping crease so that they intersect the end of the bowling crease each return crease is drawn a an line so that it extends four foot behind the bowling crease but is also in fact unlimited in length match structure and closure before a match begin the team captain who are also player toss a coin to decide which team will bat first and so take the first inning inning is the term used for each phase of play in the match in each inning one team bat attempting to score run while the other team bowl and field the ball attempting to restrict the scoring and dismiss the batsman when the first inning end the team change role there can be two to four inning depending upon the type of match a match with four scheduled inning is played over three to five day a match with two scheduled inning is usually completed in a single day during an inning all eleven member of the fielding team take the field but usually only two member of the batting team are on the field at any given time the exception to this is if a batsman ha any type of illness or injury restricting his or her ability to run in this case the batsman is allowed a runner who can run between the wicket when the batsman hit a scoring run or run though this doe not apply in international cricket the order of batsman is usually announced just before the match but it can be variedthe main objective of each team is to score more run than their opponent but in some form of cricket it is also necessary to dismiss all of the opposition batsman in their final inning in order to win the match which would otherwise be drawn if the team batting last is all out having scored fewer run than their opponent they are said to have lost by n run where n is the difference between the aggregate number of run scored by the team if the team that bat last score enough run to win it is said to have won by n wicket where n is the number of wicket left to fall for example a team that pass it opponent total having lost six wicket ie six of their batsman have been dismissed have won the match by four wicket in a match one team combined first and second inning total may be le than the other side first inning total the team with the greater score is then said to have won by an inning and n run and doe not need to bat again n is the difference between the two team aggregate score if the team batting last is all out and both side have scored the same number of run then the match is a tie this result is quite rare in match of two inning a side with only happening in match from the earliest known instance in until january in the traditional form of the game if the time allotted for the match expires before either side can win then the game is declared a drawif the match ha only a single inning per side then a maximum number of over applies to each inning such a match is called a limited over or match and the side scoring more run win regardless of the number of wicket lost so that a draw can not occur if this kind of match is temporarily interrupted by bad weather then a complex mathematical formula known a the method after it developer is often used to recalculate a new target score a match can also be declared a if fewer than a previously agreed number of over have been bowled by either team in circumstance that make normal resumption of play impossible for example wet weatherin all form of cricket the umpire can abandon the match if bad light or rain make it impossible to continue there have been instance of entire match even test match scheduled to be played over five day being lost to bad weather without a ball being bowled for example the third test of the series in australia bat and ball the essence of the sport is that a bowler delivers ie bowl the ball from his or her end of the pitch towards the batsman who armed with a bat is on strike at the other end see next basic gameplay the bat is made of wood usually salix alba white willow and ha the shape of a blade topped by a cylindrical handle the blade must not be more than inch cm wide and the total length of the bat not more than inch cm there is no standard for the weight which is usually between lb oz and lb and kg the ball is a hard spheroid with a circumference of inch cm the ball ha a seam six row of stitch attaching the leather shell of the ball to the string and cork interior the seam on a new ball is prominent and help the bowler propel it in a le predictable manner during match the quality of the ball deteriorates to a point where it is no longer usable during the course of this deterioration it behaviour in flight will change and can influence the outcome of the match player will therefore attempt to modify the ball behaviour by modifying it physical property polishing the ball and wetting it with sweat or saliva is legal even when the polishing is deliberately done on one side only to increase the ball swing through the air but the act of rubbing other substance into the ball scratching the surface or picking at the seam are illegal ball tampering basic gameplay bowler to batsman during normal play thirteen player and two umpire are on the field two of the player are batsman and the rest are all eleven member of the fielding team the other nine player in the batting team are off the field in the pavilion the image with overlay below show what is happening when a ball is being bowled and which of the personnel are on or close to the pitch in the photo the two batsman wearing yellow have taken position at each end of the pitch three member of the fielding team wearing dark blue are in shot one of the two umpire wearing white hat is stationed behind the wicket at the bowler end of the pitch the bowler is bowling the ball from his end of the pitch to the batsman at the other end who is called the striker the other batsman at the bowling end is called the the who is a specialist is positioned behind the striker wicket and behind him stand one of the fielder in a position called first slip while the bowler and the first slip are wearing conventional kit only the two batsman and the are wearing protective gear including safety helmet padded glove and leg guard pad while the umpire in shot stand at the bowler end of the pitch his colleague stand in the outfield usually in or near the fielding position called square leg so that he is in line with the popping crease at the striker end of the pitch the bowling crease not numbered is the one on which the wicket is located between the return crease the bowler intends to hit the wicket with the ball or at least to prevent the striker from scoring run the striker intends by using his bat to defend his wicket and if possible to hit the ball away from the pitch in order to score run some player are skilled in both batting and bowling or a either or these a well a so are termed bowler are classified according to their style generally a fast bowler seam bowler or spinner batsman are classified according to whether they are or fielding of the eleven fielder three are in shot in the image above the other eight are elsewhere on the field their position determined on a tactical basis by the captain or the bowler fielder often change position between delivery again a directed by the captain or bowlerif a fielder is injured or becomes ill during a match a substitute is allowed to field instead of him but the substitute can not bowl or act a a captain except in the case of concussion substitute in international cricket the substitute leaf the field when the injured player is fit to return the law of cricket were updated in to allow substitute to act a specialist role the captain is often the most experienced player in the team certainly the most tactically astute and can posse any of the main skillsets a a batsman a bowler or a within the law the captain ha certain responsibility in term of nominating his player to the umpire before the match and ensuring that his player conduct themselves within the spirit and tradition of the game a well a within the law the sometimes called simply the keeper is a specialist fielder subject to various rule within the law about his equipment and demeanour he is the only member of the fielding side who can effect a stumping and is the only one permitted to wear glove and external leg guard depending on their primary skill the other ten player in the team tend to be classified a specialist batsman or specialist bowler generally a team will include five or six specialist batsman and four or five specialist bowler plus the clothing and equipment the and the batsman wear protective gear because of the hardness of the ball which can be delivered at speed of more than kilometre per hour mph and present a major health and safety concern protective clothing includes pad designed to protect the knee and shin batting glove or glove for the hand a safety helmet for the head and a box for male player inside the trouser to protect the crotch area some batsman wear additional padding inside their shirt and trouser such a thigh pad arm pad rib protector and shoulder pad the only fielder allowed to wear protective gear are those in position very close to the batsman ie if they are alongside or in front of him but they can not wear glove or external leg guardssubject to certain variation clothing generally includes a collared shirt with short or long sleeve long trouser woolen pullover if needed cricket cap for fielding or a safety helmet and spiked shoe or boot to increase traction the kit is traditionally all white and this remains the case in test and cricket but in limited over cricket team colour are worn instead inning the inning ending with in both singular and plural form is the term used for each phase of play during a match depending on the type of match being played each team ha either one or two inning sometimes all eleven member of the batting side take a turn to bat but for various reason an inning can end before they have all done so the inning terminates if the batting team is all out a term defined by the law at the fall of a wicket or the retirement of a batsman further ball remain to be bowled but no further batsman is available to come in in this situation one of the batsman ha not been dismissed and is termed not out this is because he ha no partner left and there must always be two active batsman while the inning is in progress an inning may end early while there are still two not out batsman the batting team captain may declare the inning closed even though some of his player have not had a turn to bat this is a tactical decision by the captain usually because he belief his team have scored sufficient run and need time to dismiss the opposition in their inning the set number of over ie in a limited over match have been bowled the match ha ended prematurely due to bad weather or running out of time in the final inning of the match the batting side ha reached it target and won the game over the law state that throughout an inning the ball shall be bowled from each end alternately in over of ball the name over came about because the umpire call over when six ball have been bowled at this point another bowler is deployed at the other end and the fielding side change end while the batsman do not a bowler can not bowl two successive over although a bowler can and usually doe bowl alternate over from the same end for several over which are termed a spell the batsman do not change end at the end of the over and so the one who wa is now the striker and the umpire also change position so that the one who wa at square leg now stand behind the wicket at the end and umpire and scorer the game on the field is regulated by the two umpire one of whom stand behind the wicket at the bowler end the other in a position called square leg which is about metre away from the batsman on strike and in line with the popping crease on which he is taking guard the umpire have several responsibility including adjudication on whether a ball ha been correctly bowled ie not a or a wide when a run is scored whether a batsman is out the fielding side must first appeal to the umpire usually with the phrase how that or owzat when interval start and end and the suitability of the pitch field and weather for playing the game the umpire are authorised to interrupt or even abandon a match due to circumstance likely to endanger the player such a a damp pitch or deterioration of the lightoff the field in televised match there is usually a third umpire who can make decision on certain incident with the aid of video evidence the third umpire is mandatory under the playing condition for test and limited over international match played between two icc full member country these match also have a match referee whose job is to ensure that play is within the law and the spirit of the gamethe match detail including run and dismissal are recorded by two official scorer one representing each team the scorer are directed by the hand signal of an umpire see image right for example the umpire raise a forefinger to signal that the batsman is out ha been dismissed he raise both arm above his head if the batsman ha hit the ball for six run the scorer are required by the law to record all run scored wicket taken and over bowled in practice they also note significant amount of additional data relating to the gamea match statistic are summarised on a scorecard prior to the popularisation of scorecard most scoring wa done by men sitting on vantage point cutting notch on tally stick and run were originally called notch according to rowland bowen the earliest known scorecard template were introduced in by t pratt of sevenoaks and soon came into general use it is believed that scorecard were printed and sold at lord for the first time in spirit of the game besides observing the law cricketer must respect the spirit of cricket which is the preamble to the law first published in the code and updated in and now open with this statement cricket owes much of it appeal and enjoyment to the fact that it should be played not only according to the law but also within the spirit of cricket the preamble is a short statement that emphasis the positive behaviour that make cricket an exciting game that encourages leadership friendship and teamwork the major responsibility for ensuring fair play is placed firmly on the captain but extends to all player umpire teacher coach and parent involved the umpire are the sole judge of fair and unfair play they are required under the law to intervene in case of dangerous or unfair play or in case of unacceptable conduct by a player previous version of the spirit identified action that were deemed contrary for example appealing knowing that the batsman is not out but all specific are now covered in the law of cricket the relevant governing playing regulation and disciplinary code or left to the judgement of the umpire captain their club and governing body the terse expression of the spirit of cricket now avoids the diversity of cultural convention that exist in the detail of sportsmanship or it absence bowling and dismissal most bowler are considered specialist in that they are selected for the team because of their skill a a bowler although some are and even specialist batsman bowl occasionally the specialist bowl several time during an inning but may not bowl two over consecutively if the captain want a bowler to change end another bowler must temporarily fill in so that the change is not immediatea bowler reach his delivery stride by mean of a and an over is deemed to have begun when the bowler start his for the first delivery of that over the ball then being in play fast bowler needing momentum take a lengthy run up while bowler with a slow delivery take no more than a couple of step before bowling the fastest bowler can deliver the ball at a speed of over kilometre per hour mph and they sometimes rely on sheer speed to try to defeat the batsman who is forced to react very quickly other fast bowler rely on a mixture of speed and guile by making the ball seam or swing ie curve in flight this type of delivery can deceive a batsman into miscuing his shot for example so that the ball just touch the edge of the bat and can then be caught behind by the or a slip fielder at the other end of the bowling scale is the spin bowler who bowl at a relatively slow pace and relies entirely on guile to deceive the batsman a spinner will often buy his wicket by tossing one up in a slower steeper parabolic path to lure the batsman into making a poor shot the batsman ha to be very wary of such delivery a they are often flighted or spun so that the ball will not behave quite a he expects and he could be trapped into getting himself out in between the pacemen and the spinner are the medium paced seamers who rely on persistent accuracy to try to contain the rate of scoring and wear down the batsman concentrationthere are ten way in which a batsman can be dismissed five relatively common and five extremely rare the common form of dismissal are bowled caught leg before wicket lbw run out and stumped rare method are hit wicket hit the ball twice obstructing the field handled the ball and timed out the law state that the fielding team usually the bowler in practice must appeal for a dismissal before the umpire can give his decision if the batsman is out the umpire raise a forefinger and say out otherwise he will shake his head and say not out there is effectively an eleventh method of dismissal retired out which is not an dismissal a such but rather a retrospective one for which no fielder is credited batting run and extra batsman take turn to bat via a batting order which is decided beforehand by the team captain and presented to the umpire though the order remains flexible when the captain officially nominates the team substitute batsman are generally not allowed except in the case of concussion substitute in international cricketin order to begin batting the batsman first adopts a batting stance standardly this involves adopting a slight crouch with the foot pointing across the front of the wicket looking in the direction of the bowler and holding the bat so it pass over the foot and so it tip can rest on the ground near to the toe of the back foota skilled batsman can use a wide array of shot or stroke in both defensive and attacking mode the idea is to hit the ball to the best effect with the flat surface of the bat blade if the ball touch the side of the bat it is called an edge the batsman doe not have to play a shot and can allow the ball to go through to the wicketkeeper equally he doe not have to attempt a run when he hit the ball with his bat batsman do not always seek to hit the ball a hard a possible and a good player can score run just by making a deft stroke with a turn of the wrist or by simply blocking the ball but directing it away from fielder so that he ha time to take a run a wide variety of shot are played the batsman repertoire including stroke named according to the style of swing and the direction aimed eg cut drive hook pull the batsman on strike ie the striker must prevent the ball hitting the wicket and try to score run by hitting the ball with his bat so that he and his partner have time to run from one end of the pitch to the other before the fielding side can return the ball to register a run both runner must touch the ground behind the popping crease with either their bat or their body the batsman carry their bat a they run each completed run increment the score of both the team and the striker the decision to attempt a run is ideally made by the batsman who ha the better view of the ball progress and this is communicated by calling usually yes no or wait more than one run can be scored from a single hit hit worth one to three run are common but the size of the field is such that it is usually difficult to run four or more to compensate for this hit that reach the boundary of the field are automatically awarded four run if the ball touch the ground en route to the boundary or six run if the ball clear the boundary without touching the ground within the boundary in these case the batsman do not need to run hit for five are unusual and generally rely on the help of overthrow by a fielder returning the ball if an odd number of run is scored by the striker the two batsman have changed end and the one who wa is now the striker only the striker can score individual run but all run are added to the team totaladditional run can be gained by the batting team a extra called sundries in australia due to error made by the fielding side this is achieved in four way a penalty of one extra conceded by the bowler if he break the rule wide a penalty of one extra conceded by the bowler if he bowl so that the ball is out of the batsman reach bye an extra awarded if the batsman miss the ball and it go past the and give the batsman time to run in the conventional way leg bye a for a bye except that the ball ha hit the batsman body though not his bat if the bowler ha conceded a or a wide his team incurs an additional penalty because that ball ie delivery ha to be bowled again and hence the batting side ha the opportunity to score more run from this extra ball woman cricket woman cricket wa first recorded in surrey in international development began at the start of the century and the first test match wa played between australia and england in december the following year new zealand woman joined them and in netherlands woman became the tenth woman test nation when they made their debut against south africa woman in the international woman cricket council wa founded it merged with the icc in in the first cricket world cup of any kind took place when

limited over match can not be drawn although a tie is possible and an unfinished match is a no result single wicket wa popular in the and century and it match were generally considered in this form although each team may have from one to six player there is only one batsman in at a time and he must face every delivery bowled while his inning last single wicket ha rarely been played since limited over cricket began match tended to have two inning per team like a full one and they could end in a draw international competition most international match are played a part of when one nation travel to another for a number of week or month and play a number of match of various sort against the host nation sometimes a perpetual trophy is awarded to the winner of the test series the most famous of
