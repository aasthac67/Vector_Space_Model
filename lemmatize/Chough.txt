there are two specie of passerine bird commonly called chough chuf that constitute the genus pyrrhocorax of the corvidae crow family of bird these are the chough pyrrhocorax pyrrhocorax and the alpine chough or chough pyrrhocorax graculus the chough of australia despite it name is not a true chough but rather a member of the family corcoracidae and only distantly related the chough have black plumage and brightly coloured leg foot and bill and are resident in the mountain of southern eurasia and north africa they have long broad wing and perform spectacular aerobatics both specie pair for life and display fidelity to their breeding site which are usually cave or crevice in a cliff face they build a lined stick nest and lay three to five egg they feed usually in flock on short grazed grassland taking mainly invertebrate prey supplemented by vegetable material or food from human habitation especially in winter change in agricultural practice which have led to local population decline and range fragmentation are the main threat to this genus although neither specie is threatened globally taxonomy the first member of the genus to be described wa the chough named a upupa pyrrhocorax by linnaeus in his systema naturae in his genus upupa contained specie that had a long curved bill and a short blunt tongue these included the northern bald ibis and the hoopoe bird now known to be completely unrelated to the choughsthe alpine chough wa described a corvus graculus by linnaeus in the edition of the systema naturae although corvus is the crow genus to which the chough relative belong they were considered sufficiently distinctive to be moved to the new genus pyrrhocorax by english ornithologist marmaduke tunstall in his ornithologia britannica the genus name is derived from ancient greek purrhos purros and korax korax raven crow chough wa originally an alternative onomatopoeic name for the jackdaw corvus monedula based on it call the similar chough formerly particularly common in cornwall became known initially a cornish chough and then just chough the name transferring from one specie to the otherthe fossil record from the pleistocene of europe includes a form similar to the alpine chough and sometimes categorised a an extinct subspecies of that bird and a prehistoric form of the chough p p primigenius there are eight generally recognised extant subspecies of chough and two of alpine although all differ only slightly from the nominate form the greater subspecies diversity in the specie arises from an early divergence of the asian and geographically isolated ethiopian race from the western formsthe closest relative of the chough a indicated by a study of molecular phylogeny is the treepie temnurus temnurus and they form a clade that is sister to the remaining living member of the corvidae the genus pyrrhocorax specie differ from corvus in that they have brightly coloured bill and foot smooth not scaled tarsus and very short dense nasal feather chough have uniformly black plumage lacking any paler area a seen in some of their relative the two pyrrhocorax are the main host of two specialist chough flea frontopsylla frontalis and f laetus not normally found on other corvidsthe australian chough corcorax melanorhamphos despite it similar shape and habit is only distantly related to the true chough and is an example of convergent evolution distribution and habitat chough breed in mountain from morocco and spain eastward through southern europe and the alp across central asia and the himalaya to western china the alpine chough is also found in corsica and crete and the chough ha population in ireland the uk the isle of man and two area of the ethiopian highland both specie are resident throughout their range only occasionally wandering to neighbouring countriesthese bird are mountain specialist although chough also use coastal sea cliff in ireland great britain and brittany feeding on adjacent short grazed grassland or machair the small population on la palma one of the canary island is also coastal the chough more typically breed in mountain above m ft in europe m ft in north africa and m ft in the himalaya in that mountain range it reach metre ft in the summer and ha been recorded at metre ft altitude on mount everest the alpine chough breed above m ft in europe m ft in morocco and m ft in the himalaya it ha nested at m ft higher than any other bird specie and it ha been observed following mountaineer ascending mount everest at an altitude of m ft where the two specie occur in the same mountain the alpine specie tends to breed at a higher elevation than it relative since it is better adapted for a diet at high altitude description the chough are corvids the chough is centimetre in in length with a centimetre in wingspan and the alpine chough average slightly smaller at in length with a cm in wingspan these bird have black plumage similar to that of many corvus crow but they are readily distinguished from member of that genus by their brightly coloured bill and leg the alpine chough ha a yellow bill and the chough ha a long curved red bill both specie have red leg a adult the sex are similar but the juvenile of each specie ha a duller bill and leg than the adult and it plumage lack the glossiness seen in older bird other physical distinction are summarised in the table below the two chough are distinguishable from each other by their bill colour and in flight the long broad wing and short tail of the give it a silhouette quite different from it slightly smaller relative both specie fly with loose deep wing beat and frequently use their manoeuvrability to perform acrobatic display soaring in the updraughts at cliff face then diving and rolling with fanned tail and folded wingsthe chough loud ringing call is similar in character to that of other corvids particularly the jackdaw although it is clearer and louder than the call of that specie in contrast the alpine chough ha rippling preep and whistled sweeeooo call quite unlike the crow small subspecies of both chough have higher frequency call than larger race a predicted by the inverse relationship between body size and frequency behaviour and ecology breeding chough are monogamous and show high partner and site fidelity both specie build a bulky nest of root stick and plant stem lined with grass fine twiglets or hair it is constructed on a ledge in a cave or similar fissure in a cliff face or in location like abandoned building quarry or dam will also sometimes use occupied building such a mongolian monastery the chough are not colonial although in suitable habitat several pair may nest in close proximityboth specie lay normally whitish egg blotched with brown or grey which are incubated by the female alone the chick hatch after two to three week chough chick are almost naked but the chick of the higher altitude alpine chough hatch with a dense covering of natal down the chick are fed by both parent and fledge in day after hatching for alpine chough and day for alpine chough lay it egg about one month later than it relative although breeding success and reproductive behaviour are similar the similarity between the two specie presumably arose because of the same strong environmental constraint on breeding behaviour the survival rate of the juvenile chough is percent and for the alpine it is the annual adult survival rate is for alpine but is unknown for feeding in the summer both chough feed mainly on invertebrate such a beetle snail grasshopper caterpillar and fly larva ant are a favoured food of the chough prey item are taken from short grazed pasture or in the case of coastal population of chough area where plant growth is hindered by exposure to coastal salt spray or poor soil the chough bill may be used to pick insect off the surface or to dig for grub and other invertebrate the chough typically excavates to cm in in the thin soil of it feeding area but it may dig to cm in in suitable conditionsplant matter is also eaten and chough will take fallen grain where the opportunity arises it ha been reported a damaging barley crop by breaking off the ripening head to extract the corn alpine chough rely more on fruit and berry at time of year when animal prey is limited and will readily supplement their winter diet with food provided by tourist activity in mountain region including ski resort refuse dump and picnic area both pyrrhocorax specie feed in flock on open area often some distance from the breeding cliff particularly in winter feeding trip may cover km mi distance and m ft in altitude in the alp the development of skiing above m ft ha enabled more alpine chough to remain at high level in winterwhere their range overlap the two chough specie may feed together in the summer although there is only limited competition for food an italian study showed that the vegetable part of the winter diet for the chough wa almost exclusively gagea bulb whilst the alpine chough took berry and hip in june chough fed mainly on caterpillar whereas alpine chough ate cranefly pupa later in the summer the alpine chough consumed large number of grasshopper while the chough added cranefly pupa fly larva and beetle to it diet in the eastern himalaya in november alpine chough occur mainly in juniper forest where they feed on juniper berry differing ecologically from the chough in the same region and at the same time of year which dig for food in the soil of the village terraced pasture natural threat predator of the chough include the peregrine falcon golden eagle and eurasian while the common raven will take nestling in northern spain chough preferentially nest near lesser kestrel colony the falcon which eats only insect provides a degree of protection against larger predator and the chough benefit in term of a higher breeding success the chough is occasionally parasitised by the great spotted cuckoo a brood parasite for which the eurasian magpie is the primary hostthe chough host bird flea including two frontopsylla specie which are pyrrhocorax specialist other parasite recorded on chough include a cestode choanotaenia pirinica and various specie of chewing louse in the genus brueelia menacanthus and philopterus blood parasite such a plasmodium have been found in chough but this is uncommon and apparently doe little harm parasitism level are much lower than in some other passerine group status both pyrrhocorax specie have extensive geographical range and large population neither is thought to approach the threshold for the global population decline criterion of the iucn red list ie declining more than in ten year or three generation and they are therefore evaluated a being of least concern however some population particularly on island such a corsica and la palma are small and isolatedboth chough occupied more extensive range in the past reaching to more southerly and lower altitude area than at present with the alpine chough breeding in europe a far south a southern italy and both the decline and range fragmentation continue chough have lost ground in most of europe and alpine chough have lost many breeding site in the east of the continent in the canary island the chough is now extinct on two of the island on which it formerly bred and the alpine wa lost from the archipelago altogetherthe cause of the decline include the fragmentation and loss of open grassland to scrub or human activity such a the construction of ski resort and a threat come from global warming which would cause the specie preferred alpine climate zone to shift to higher more restricted area or locally to disappear entirelythe chough which breed at lower level ha been more affected by human activity and the decline away from it main alpine breeding area have seen it categorised a vulnerable in europe only in spain is it still common and it ha recently expanded it range in that country by nesting in old building in area close to it traditional mountain breeding site in culture further information chough although these are mainly mountain specie with limited interaction with human the chough ha a coastal population in the far west of it range and ha cultural connection particularly with cornwall where it appears on the cornish coat of arm a legend from that county say that king arthur did not die but wa transformed into a chough and hence killing this bird wa unluckythe chough wa formerly reputed to be a habitual thief of small object from house including burning wood or lighted candle which it would use to set fire to haystack or thatched roofsas a high altitude specie with limited contact with human until the development of mountain tourism activity the alpine chough ha little cultural significance it wa however featured together with it wild mountain habitat in olivier messiaen s catalogue bird catalogue a piano piece written in le
