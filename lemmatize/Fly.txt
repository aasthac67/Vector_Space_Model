true fly are insect of the order diptera the name being derived from the greek two and pteron pteron wing insect of this order use only a single pair of wing to fly the hindwings having evolved into advanced mechanosensory organ known a halter which act a sensor of rotational movement and allow dipteran to perform advanced aerobatics diptera is a large order containing an estimated specie including crane fly hoverflies and others although only about specie have been describedflies have a mobile head with a pair of large compound eye and mouthpart designed for piercing and sucking mosquito black fly and robber fly or for lapping and sucking in the other group their wing arrangement give them great maneuverability in flight and claw and pad on their foot enable them to cling to smooth surface fly undergo complete metamorphosis the egg are laid on the larval and the larva which lack true limb develop in a protected environment often inside their food source the pupa is a tough capsule from which the adult emerges when ready to do so fly mostly have short life a adult diptera is one of the major insect order and of considerable ecological and human importance fly are important pollinator second only to the bee and their hymenopteran relative fly may have been among the evolutionarily earliest pollinator responsible for early plant pollination fruit fly are used a model organism in research but le benignly mosquito are vector for malaria dengue west nile fever yellow fever encephalitis and other infectious disease and housefly commensal with human all over the world spread illness fly can be annoyance especially in some part of the world where they can occur in large number buzzing and settling on the skin or eye to bite or seek fluid larger fly such a tsetse fly and screwworms cause significant economic harm to cattle blowfly larva known a gentles and other dipteran larva known more generally a maggot are used a fishing bait and a food for carnivorous animal they are also used in medicine in debridement to clean wound taxonomy and phylogeny relationship to other insect dipteran are endopterygotes insect that undergo radical metamorphosis they belong to the mecopterida alongside the mecoptera siphonaptera lepidoptera and trichoptera the possession of a single pair of wing distinguishes most true fly from other insect with fly in their name however some true fly such a hippoboscidae louse fly have become secondarily winglessthe cladogram represents the current consensus view relationship between fly subgroup and family the first true dipteran known are from the middle triassic around million year ago and they became widespread during the middle and late triassic modern flowering plant did not appear until the cretaceous around million year ago so the original dipteran must have had a different source of nutrition other than nectar based on the attraction of many modern fly group to shiny droplet it ha been suggested that they may have fed on honeydew produced by bug which were abundant at the time and dipteran mouthpart are to softening and lapping up the crusted residue the basal clade in the diptera include the deuterophlebiidae and the enigmatic nymphomyiidae three episode of evolutionary radiation are thought to have occurred based on the fossil record many new specie of lower diptera developed in the triassic about million year ago many lower brachycera appeared in the jurassic some million year ago a third radiation took place among the schizophora at the start of the paleogene million year agothe phylogenetic position of diptera ha been controversial the monophyly of holometabolous insect ha long been accepted with the main order being established a lepidoptera coleoptera hymenoptera and diptera and it is the relationship between these group which ha caused difficulty diptera is widely thought to be a member of mecopterida along with lepidoptera butterfly and moth trichoptera caddisflies siphonaptera flea mecoptera scorpionflies and possibly strepsiptera fly diptera ha been grouped with siphonaptera and mecoptera in the antliophora but this ha not been confirmed by molecular studiesdiptera were traditionally broken down into two suborder nematocera and brachycera distinguished by the difference in antenna the nematocera are identified by their elongated body and often feathery antenna a represented by mosquito and crane fly the brachycera have rounder body and much shorter antenna subsequent study have identified the nematocera a being with modern phylogeny placing the brachycera within grade of group formerly placed in the nematocera the construction of a phylogenetic tree ha been the subject of ongoing research the following cladogram is based on the flytree project abbreviation used in the cladogram diversity fly are often abundant and are found in almost all terrestrial habitat in the world apart from antarctica they include many familiar insect such a house fly blow fly mosquito gnat black fly midge and fruit fly more than have been formally described and the actual specie diversity is much greater with the fly from many part of the world yet to be studied intensively the suborder nematocera include generally small slender insect with long antenna such a mosquito gnat midge and while the brachycera includes broader more robust fly with short antenna many nematoceran larva are aquatic there are estimated to be a total of about specie of diptera in europe in the nearctic region in the afrotropical region in the oriental region and in the australasian region while most specie have restricted distribution a few like the housefly musca domestica are cosmopolitan gauromydas hero asiloidea with a length of up to cm in is generally considered to be the largest fly in the world while the smallest is euryplatea nanaknihali which at mm in is smaller than a grain of saltbrachycera are ecologically very diverse with many being predatory at the larval stage and some being parasitic animal parasitised include mollusc woodlouse millipede insect mammal and amphibian fly are the second largest group of pollinator after the hymenoptera bee wasp and relative in wet and colder environment fly are significantly more important a pollinator compared to bee they need le food a they do not need to provision their young many flower that bear low nectar and those that have evolved trap pollination depend on fly it is thought that some of the earliest pollinator of plant may have been fliesthe greatest diversity of gall forming insect are found among the fly principally in the family cecidomyiidae gall midge many fly most importantly in the family agromyzidae lay their egg in the mesophyll tissue of leaf with larva feeding between the surface forming blister and mine some family are mycophagous or fungus feeding these include the cave dwelling mycetophilidae fungus gnat whose larva are the only diptera with bioluminescence the sciaridae are also fungus feeder some plant are pollinated by fungus feeding fly that visit fungus infected male flowersthe larva of megaselia scalaris phoridae are almost omnivorous and consume such substance a paint and shoe polish the exorista mella walker fly are considered generalist and parasitoids of a variety of host the larva of the shore fly ephydridae and some chironomidae survive in extreme environment including glacier diamesa sp chironomidae hot spring geyser saline pool sulphur pool septic tank and even crude oil helaeomyia petrolei adult hoverflies syrphidae are well known for their mimicry and the larva adopt diverse lifestyle including being inquiline scavenger inside the nest of social insect some brachycerans are agricultural pest some bite animal and human and suck their blood and some transmit disease anatomy and morphology fly are adapted for aerial movement and typically have short and streamlined body the first tagma of the fly the head bear the eye the antenna and the mouthpart the labrum labium mandible and maxilla make up the mouthpart the second tagma the thorax bear the wing and contains the flight muscle on the second segment which is greatly enlarged the first and third segment have been reduced to structure and the third segment bear the halter which help to balance the insect during flight the third tagma is the abdomen consisting of segment some of which may be fused and with the hindmost segment modified for reproduction some dipteran are mimic and can only be distinguished from their model by very careful inspection an example of this is spilomyia longicornis which is a fly but mimic a vespid wasp fly have a mobile head with a pair of large compound eye on the side of the head and in most specie three small ocellus on the top the compound eye may be close together or widely separated and in some instance are divided into a dorsal region and a ventral region perhaps to assist in swarming behaviour the antenna are but variable being feathery or in the different family the mouthpart are adapted for piercing and sucking a in the black fly mosquito and robber fly and for lapping and sucking a in many other group female use mandible and maxilla to make a incision in the host skin and then lap up the blood that flow the gut includes large diverticulae allowing the insect to store small quantity of liquid after a mealfor visual course control fly optic flow field is analyzed by a set of neuron a subset of these neuron is thought to be involved in using the optic flow to estimate the parameter of such a yaw roll and sideward translation other neuron are thought to be involved in analyzing the content of the visual scene itself such a separating figure from the ground using motion parallax the neuron is responsible for detecting horizontal motion across the entire visual field of the fly allowing the fly to generate and guide stabilizing motor correction midflight with respect to yaw the ocellus are concerned in the detection of change in light intensity enabling the fly to react swiftly to the approach of an objectlike other insect fly have chemoreceptor that detect smell and taste and mechanoreceptors that respond to touch the third segment of the antenna and the maxillary palps bear the main olfactory receptor while the gustatory receptor are in the labium pharynx foot wing margin and female genitalia enabling fly to taste their food by walking on it the taste receptor in female at the tip of the abdomen receive information on the suitability of a site for ovipositing fly that feed on blood have special sensory structure that can detect infrared emission and use them to home in on their host and many fly can detect the raised concentration of carbon dioxide that occurs near large animal some tachinid fly ormiinae which are parasitoids of bush cricket have sound receptor to help them locate their singing host diptera have one pair of fore wing on the mesothorax and a pair of halter or reduced hind wing on the metathorax a further adaptation for flight is the reduction in number of the neural ganglion and concentration of nerve tissue in the thorax a feature that is most extreme in the highly derived muscomorpha infraorder some specie of fly are exceptional in that they are secondarily flightless the only other order of insect bearing a single pair of true functional wing in addition to any form of halter are the strepsiptera in contrast to the fly the strepsiptera bear their halter on the mesothorax and their flight wing on the metathorax each of the fly six leg ha a typical insect structure of coxa trochanter femur tibia and tarsus with the tarsus in most instance being subdivided into five tarsomeres at the tip of the limb is a pair of claw and between these are structure known a pulvilli which provide adhesionthe abdomen show considerable variability among member of the order it consists of eleven segment in primitive group and ten segment in more derived group the tenth and eleventh segment having fused the last two or three segment are adapted for reproduction each segment is made up of a dorsal and a ventral sclerite connected by an elastic membrane in some female the sclerite are rolled into a flexible telescopic ovipositor flight fly are capable of great manoeuvrability during flight due to the presence of the halter these act a gyroscopic organ and are rapidly oscillated in time with the wing they act a a balance and guidance system by providing rapid feedback to the muscle and fly deprived of their halter are unable to fly the wing and halter move in synchrony but the amplitude of each wing beat is independent allowing the fly to turn sideways the wing of the fly are attached to two kind of muscle those used to power it and another set used for fine controlflies tend to fly in a straight line then make a rapid change in direction before continuing on a different straight path the directional change are called saccade and typically involve an angle of being achieved in millisecond they are initiated by visual stimulus a the fly observes an object nerve then activate steering muscle in the thorax that cause a small change in wing stroke which generate sufficient torque to turn detecting this within four or five wingbeats the halter trigger a and the fly head off in a new directionflies have rapid reflex that aid their escape from predator but their sustained flight speed are low dolichopodid fly in the genus condylostylus respond in le than millisecond to camera flash by taking flight in the past the deer bot fly cephenemyia wa claimed to be one of the fastest insect on the basis of an estimate made visually by charles townsend in this claim of speed of to mile per hour wa regularly repeated until it wa shown to be physically impossible a well a incorrect by irving langmuir langmuir suggested an estimated speed of mile per houralthough most fly live and fly close to the ground a few are known to fly at height and a few like oscinella chloropidae are known to be dispersed by wind at altitude of up to ft and over long distance some hover fly like metasyrphus corollae have been known to undertake long flight in response to aphid population spurtsmales of fly specie such a cuterebra many hover fly bee fly bombyliidae and fruit fly tephritidae maintain territory within which they engage in aerial pursuit to drive away intruding male and other specie while these territory may be held by individual male some specie such a a freeborni form lek with many male aggregating in display some fly maintain an airspace and still others form dense swarm that maintain a stationary location with respect to landmark many fly mate in flight while swarming life cycle and development diptera go through a complete metamorphosis with four distinct life stage egg larva pupa and adult larva in many fly the larval stage is long and adult may have a short life most dipteran larva develop in protected environment many are aquatic and others are found in moist place such a carrion fruit vegetable matter fungi and in the case of parasitic specie inside their host they tend to have thin cuticle and become desiccated if exposed to the air apart from the brachycera most dipteran larva have sclerotinised head capsule which may be reduced to remnant mouth hook the brachycera however have soft gelatinized head capsule from which the sclerite are reduced or missing many of these larva retract their head into their thorax some other anatomical distinction exists between the larva of the nematocera and the brachycera especially in the brachycera little demarcation is seen between the thorax and abdomen though the demarcation may be visible in many nematocera such a mosquito in the brachycera the head of the larva is not clearly distinguishable from the rest of the body and few if any sclerite are present informally such brachyceran larva are called maggot but the term is not technical and often applied indifferently to fly larva or insect larva in general the eye and antenna of brachyceran larva are reduced or absent and the abdomen also lack appendage such a cerci this lack of feature is an adaptation to food such a carrion decaying detritus or host tissue surrounding endoparasite nematoceran larva generally have eye and antenna while those of brachyceran larva are reduced or modifieddipteran larva have no jointed true leg but some dipteran larva such a specie of simuliidae tabanidae and vermileonidae have prolegs adapted to hold onto a substrate in flowing water host tissue or prey the majority of dipteran are oviparous and lay batch of egg but some specie are ovoviviparous where the larva starting development inside the egg before they hatch or viviparous the larva hatching and maturing in the body of the mother before being externally deposited these are found especially in group that have larva dependent on food source that are or are accessible for brief period this is widespread in some family such a the sarcophagidae in hylemya strigosa anthomyiidae the larva moult to the second instar before hatching and in termitoxenia phoridae female have incubation pouch and a full developed third instar larva is deposited by the adult and it almost immediately pupates with no freely feeding larval stage the tsetse fly a well a other glossinidae hippoboscidae nycteribidae and streblidae exhibit adenotrophic viviparity a single fertilised egg is retained in the oviduct and the developing larva feed on glandular secretion when fully grown the female find a spot with soft soil and the larva work it way out of the oviduct buries itself and pupates some fly like lundstroemia parthenogenetica chironomidae reproduce by thelytokous parthenogenesis and some gall midge have larva that can produce egg paedogenesis pupa the pupa take various form in some group particularly the nematocera the pupa is intermediate between the larval and adult form these pupa are described a obtect having the future appendage visible a structure that adhere to the pupal body the outer surface of the pupa may be leathery and bear spine respiratory feature or locomotory paddle in other group described a coarctate the appendage are not visible in these the outer surface is a puparium formed from the last larval skin and the actual pupa is concealed within when the adult insect is ready to emerge from this tough capsule it inflates a structure on it head and force it way out adult the adult stage is usually short it function only to mate and lay egg the genitalia of male fly are rotated to a varying degree from the position found in other insect in some fly this is a temporary rotation during mating but in others it is a permanent torsion of the organ that occurs during the pupal stage this torsion may lead to the anus being below the genitals or in the case of torsion to the sperm duct being wrapped around the gut and the external organ being in their usual position when fly mate the male initially fly on top of the female facing in the same direction but then turn around to face in the opposite direction this force the male to lie on his back for his genitalia to remain engaged with those of the female or the torsion of the male genitals allows the male to mate while remaining upright this lead to fly having more reproduction ability than most insect and much quicker fly occur in large population due to their ability to mate effectively and quickly during the mating season ecology a ubiquitous insect dipteran play an important role at various trophic level both a consumer and a prey in some group the larva complete their development without feeding and in others the adult do not feed the larva can be herbivore scavenger decomposers predator or parasite with the consumption of decaying organic matter being one of the most prevalent feeding behaviour the fruit or detritus is consumed along with the associated a filter in the pharynx being used to concentrate the particle while larva have to help shred their food the larva of some group feed on or in the living tissue of plant and fungi and some of these are serious pest of agricultural crop some aquatic larva consume the film of algae that form underwater on rock and plant many of the parasitoid larva grow inside and eventually kill other arthropod while parasitic larva may attack vertebrate hostswhereas many dipteran larva are aquatic or live in enclosed terrestrial location the majority of adult live above ground and are capable of flight predominantly they feed on nectar or plant or animal exudate such a honeydew for which their lapping mouthpart are adapted some fly have functional mandible that may be used for biting the fly that feed on vertebrate blood have sharp stylet that pierce the skin with some specie having anticoagulant saliva that is regurgitated before absorbing the blood that flow in this process certain disease can be transmitted the bot fly oestridae have evolved to parasitize mammal many specie complete their life cycle inside the body of their host the larva of a few fly group agromyzidae anthomyiidae cecidomyiidae are capable of inducing plant gall some dipteran larva are the larva of many brachyceran family are predaceous in many dipteran group swarming is a feature of adult life with cloud of insect gathering in certain location these insect are mostly male and the swarm may serve the purpose of making their location more visible to femalesmost adult diptera have their mouthpart modified to sponge up fluid the adult of many specie of fly that feed on liquid food will regurgitate fluid in a behaviour termed a bubbling which ha been thought to help the insect evaporate water and concentrate food or possibly to cool by evaporation some adult diptera are known for kleptoparasitism such a member of the sarcophagidae the miltogramminae are known a satellite fly for their habit of following wasp and stealing their stung prey or laying their egg into them phorids milichids and the genus bengalia are known to steal food carried by ant adaptation fly are eaten by other animal at all stage of their development the egg and larva are parasitised by other insect and are eaten by many creature some of which specialise in feeding on fly but most of which consume them a part of a mixed diet bird bat frog lizard dragonfly and spider are among the predator of fly many fly have evolved mimetic resemblance that aid their protection batesian mimicry is widespread with many hoverflies resembling bee and wasp ant and some specie of tephritid fruit fly resembling spider some specie of hoverfly are myrmecophilous their young live and grow within the nest of ant they are protected from the ant by imitating chemical odour given by ant colony member bombyliid bee fly such a bombylius major are round furry and distinctly a they visit flower for nectar and are likely also batesian mimic of beesin contrast drosophila subobscura a specie of fly in the genus drosophila lack a category of hemocytes that are present in other studied specie of drosophila leading to an inability to defend against parasitic attack a form of innate immunodeficiency in culture symbolism fly play a variety of symbolic role in different culture these include both positive and negative role in religion in the traditional navajo religion big fly is an important spirit being in christian demonology beelzebub is a demonic fly the lord of the fly and a god of the philistinesflies have appeared in literature since ancient sumer in a sumerian poem a fly help the goddess inanna when her husband dumuzid is being chased by galla demon in the mesopotamian version of the flood myth the dead corps floating on the water are compared to fly later the god are said to swarm like fly around the hero utnapishtim offering fly appear on old babylonian seal a symbol of nergal the god of death lapis lazuli bead were often worn in ancient mesopotamia along with other kind of prometheus bound which is attributed to the athenian tragic playwright aeschylus a gadfly sent by zeus wife hera pursues and torment his mistress io who ha been transformed into a cow and is watched constantly by the hundred eye of the herdsman argus io ah hah

in film and television production the metaphoric name suggests that event are seen candidly a a fly might see them fly have inspired the design of miniature flying robot steven spielberg film jurassic park relied on the idea that dna could be preserved in the stomach content of a fly fossilised in amber though the mechanism ha been discounted by scientist economic importance dipteran are an important group of insect and have a considerable impact on the environment some fly agromyzidae fruit fly tephritidae and drosophilidae and gall midge cecidomyiidae are pest of agricultural crop others such a tsetse fly screwworm and botfly oestridae attack livestock causing wound spreading disease and creating significant economic harm see article parasitic fly of domestic animal a few can even cause myiasis in human still others such a mosquito culicidae blackfly simuliidae and drain fly psychodidae impact human health acting a vector of major tropical disease among these anopheles mosquito transmit malaria filariasis and arbovirus aedes aegypti mosquito carry dengue fever and the zika virus blackfly carry river blindness sand fly carry leishmaniasis other dipteran are a nuisance to human especially when present in large number these include housefly which contaminate food and spread illness the biting midge and sandfly ceratopogonidae and the housefly and stable fly muscidae in tropical region eye fly chloropidae which visit the eye in search of fluid can be a nuisance in some seasonsmany dipteran serve role that are useful to human housefly blowfly and fungus gnat mycetophilidae are scavenger and aid in decomposition robber fly asilidae tachinids tachinidae and dagger fly and balloon fly empididae are predator and parasitoids of other insect helping to control a variety of pest many dipteran such a bee fly bombyliidae and hoverflies syrphidae are pollinator of crop plant us drosophila melanogaster a fruit fly ha long been used a a model organism in research because of the ease with which it can be bred and reared in the laboratory it small genome and the fact that many of it gene have counterpart in higher eukaryote a large number of genetic study have been undertaken based on this specie these have had a profound impact on the study of gene expression gene regulatory mechanism and mutation other study have investigated physiology microbial pathogenesis and development among other research topic the study on dipteran relationship by willi hennig helped in the development of cladistics technique that he applied to morphological character but now adapted for use with molecular sequence in phylogenetics maggot found on corps are useful to forensic entomologist maggot specie can be identified by their anatomical feature and by matching their dna maggot of different specie of fly visit corps and carcase at fairly time after the death of the victim and so do their predator such a beetle in the family histeridae thus the presence or absence of particular specie provides evidence for the time since death and sometimes other detail such a the place of death when specie are confined to particular habitat such a woodland some specie of maggot such a blowfly larva gentles and bluebottle larva caster are bred commercially they are sold a bait in angling and a food for carnivorous animal kept a pet in zoo or for research such a some mammal fish reptile and bird it ha been suggested that fly larva could be used at a large scale a food for farmed chicken pig and fish however consumer are opposed to the inclusion of insect in their food and the use of insect in animal feed remains illegal in area such a the european union fly larva can be used a a biomedical tool for wound care and treatment maggot debridement therapy mdt is the use of blow fly larva to remove the dead tissue from wound most commonly being amputation historically this ha been used for century both intentional and unintentional on battlefield and in early hospital setting removing the dead tissue promotes cell growth and healthy wound healing the larva also have biochemical property such a antibacterial activity found in their secretion a they feed these medicinal maggot are a safe and effective treatment for chronic woundsthe sardinian cheese casu marzu is exposed to fly known a cheese skipper such a piophila casei member of the family piophilidae the digestive activity of the fly larva soften the cheese and modify the aroma a part of the process of maturation at one time european union authority banned sale of the cheese and it wa becoming hard to find but the ban ha been lifted on the ground that the cheese is a traditional local product made by traditional method note reference further reading blagoderov va
