a camel is an ungulate in the genus camelus that bear distinctive fatty deposit known a hump on it back camel have long been domesticated and a livestock they provide food milk and meat and textile fiber and felt from hair camel are working animal especially suited to their desert habitat and are a vital mean of transport for passenger and cargo there are three surviving specie of camel the dromedary make up of the world camel population and the bactrian camel make up the wild bactrian camel is a separate specie and is now critically endangered the word camel is also used informally in a wider sense where the more correct term is camelid to include all seven specie of the family camelidae the true camel the above three specie along with the new world camelids the llama the alpaca the guanaco and the vicuna the word itself is derived via latin camelus and greek kamelos kamelos from hebrew arabic or phoenician gamal taxonomy extant specie specie are extant recently extinct specie an extinct specie of camel in the separate genus camelops known a c hesternus lived in western north america until the end of the pleistocene roughly year ago biology the average life expectancy of a camel is to year a adult dromedary camel stand m ft in at the shoulder and m ft in at the hump bactrian camel can be a foot taller camel can run at up to mph in short burst and sustain speed of up to mph bactrian camel weigh to kg to lb and dromedary to kg to lb the widening toe on a camel hoof provide supplemental grip for varying soil sedimentsthe male dromedary camel ha an organ called a dulla in it throat a large inflatable sac he extrudes from his mouth when in rut to assert dominance and attract female it resembles a long swollen pink tongue hanging out of the side of it mouth camel mate by having both male and female sitting on the ground with the male mounting from behind the male usually ejaculate three or four time within a single mating session camelids are the only ungulate to mate in a sitting position ecological and behavioral adaptation camel do not directly store water in their hump they are reservoir of fatty tissue concentrating body fat in their hump minimizes the insulating effect fat would have if distributed over the rest of their body helping camel survive in hot climate when this tissue is metabolized it yield more than one gram of water for every gram of fat processed this fat metabolization while releasing energy cause water to evaporate from the lung during respiration a oxygen is required for the metabolic process overall there is a net decrease in water camel have a series of physiological adaptation that allow them to withstand long period of time without any external source of water the dromedary camel can drink a seldom a once every day even under very hot condition and can lose up to of it body mass due to dehydration unlike other mammal camel red blood cell are oval rather than circular in shape this facilitates the flow of red blood cell during dehydration and make them better at withstanding high osmotic variation without rupturing when drinking large amount of water a kg lb camel can drink l u gal of water in three minutescamels are able to withstand change in body temperature and water consumption that would kill most other mammal their temperature range from at dawn and steadily increase to by sunset before they cool off at night again in general to compare between camel and the other livestock camel lose only liter of fluid intake every day while the other livestock lose to liter per day breulmann et al maintaining the brain temperature within certain limit is critical for animal to assist this camel have a rete mirabile a complex of artery and vein lying very close to each other which utilizes countercurrent blood flow to cool blood flowing to the brain camel rarely sweat even when ambient temperature reach any sweat that doe occur evaporates at the skin level rather than at the surface of their coat the heat of vaporization therefore come from body heat rather than ambient heat camel can withstand losing of their body weight to sweating whereas most other mammal can withstand only about dehydration before cardiac failure result from circulatory disturbancewhen the camel exhales water vapor becomes trapped in their nostril and is reabsorbed into the body a a mean to conserve water camel eating green herbage can ingest sufficient moisture in milder condition to maintain their body hydrated state without the need for drinking the camel thick coat insulates it from the intense heat radiated from desert sand a shorn camel must sweat more to avoid overheating during the summer the coat becomes lighter in color reflecting light a well a helping avoid sunburn the camel long leg help by keeping it body farther from the ground which can heat up to dromedary have a pad of thick tissue over the sternum called the pedestal when the animal lie down in a sternal recumbent position the pedestal raise the body from the hot surface and allows cooling air to pas under the bodycamels mouth have a thick leathery lining allowing them to chew thorny desert plant long eyelash and ear hair together with nostril that can close form a barrier against sand if sand get lodged in their eye they can dislodge it using their transparent third eyelid the camel gait and widened foot help them move without sinking into the sandthe kidney and intestine of a camel are very efficient at reabsorbing water camel kidney have a cortex to medulla ratio thus the medullary part of a camel kidney occupies twice a much area a a cow kidney secondly renal corpuscle have a smaller diameter which reduces surface area for filtration these two major anatomical characteristic enable camel to conserve water and limit the volume of urine in extreme desert condition camel urine come out a a thick syrup and camel faeces are so dry that they do not require drying when the bedouin use them to fuel firesthe camel immune system differs from those of other mammal normally the antibody molecule consist of two heavy or long chain along the length of the y and two light or short chain at each tip of the y camel in addition to these also have antibody made of only two heavy chain a trait that make them smaller and more durable these antibody discovered in are thought to have developed million year ago after camelids split from ruminant and pig genetics the karyotype of different camelid specie have been studied earlier by many group but no agreement on chromosome nomenclature of camelids ha been reached a study flow sorted camel chromosome building on the fact that camel have pair of chromosome and found that the karyotype consisted of one metacentric three submetacentric and acrocentric autosome the y is a small metacentric chromosome while the x is a large metacentric chromosome the hybrid camel a hybrid between bactrian and dromedary camel ha one hump though it ha an indentation cm in deep that divide the front from the back the hybrid is m ft in at the shoulder and m ft in tall at the hump it weighs an average of kg lb and can carry around to kg to lb which is more than either the dromedary or bactrian canaccording to molecular data the wild bactrian camel c ferus separated from the domestic bactrian camel c bactrianus about million year ago new world and old world camelids diverged about million year ago in spite of this these specie can hybridize and produce viable offspring the cama is a hybrid bred by scientist to see how closely related the parent specie are scientist collected semen from a camel via an artificial vagina and inseminated a llama after stimulating ovulation with gonadotrophin injection the cama is halfway in size between a camel and a llama and lack a hump it ha ear intermediate between those of camel and llama longer leg than the llama and partially cloven hoof like the mule camas are sterile despite both parent having the same number of chromosome evolution the earliest known camel called protylopus lived in north america to million year ago during the eocene it wa about the size of a rabbit and lived in the open woodland of what is now south dakota by million year ago the poebrotherium wa the size of a goat and had many more trait similar to camel and llama the hoofed stenomylus which walked on the tip of it toe also existed around this time and the aepycamelus evolved in the miocenean early relative of extant old world camel paracamelus existed in the upper miocene to middle pleistocene around million year ago the north american camelidae spread to south america a part of the great american interchange via the newly formed isthmus of panama where they gave rise to guanaco and related animal and to asia via the bering land bridge surprising find of fossil paracamelus on ellesmere island beginning in in the high canadian arctic suggest that the extant old world camel may descend from a larger boreal browser whose hump may have evolved a an adaptation in a cold climate this creature is estimated to have stood around nine foot metre tall the bactrican camel diverged from the dromedary about million year ago according to the fossil recordthe last camel native to north america wa camelops hesternus which vanished along with horse bear mammoth and mastodon ground sloth sabertooth cat and many other megafauna coinciding with the migration of human from asia domestication like horse before their extinction in their continent of origin camel spread across beringia moving in the opposite direction from the asian immigration to america they survived in the old world and eventually human domesticated them and spread them globally along with many other megafauna in north america the original wild camel were wiped out during the spread of the first indigenous people of the america from asia into north america year ago although fossil have never been associated with definitive evidence of huntingmost camel surviving today are domesticated although feral population exist in australia india and kazakhstan wild camel survive only in the wild bactrian camel population of the gobi deserthumans may have first domesticated dromedary in somalia and southern arabia around bce and bactrian camel in central asia around bce a at sukhteh also known a the burnt city iranmartin heide work on the domestication of the camel tentatively concludes that human had domesticated the bactrian camel by at least the middle of the third millennium somewhere east of the zagros mountain with the practice then moving into mesopotamia heide suggests that mention of camel in the patriarchal narrative may refer at least in some place to the bactrian camel while noting that the camel is not mentioned in relationship to canaanrecent excavation in the timna valley by lidar and erez discovered what may be the earliest domestic camel bone yet found in israel or even outside the arabian peninsula dating to around bc this garnered considerable medium coverage a it is strong evidence that the story of abraham jacob esau and joseph were written after this timethe existence of camel in not in the eastern mediterranean not a new idea the historian richard bulliet did not think that the occasional mention of camel in the bible meant that the domestic camel were common in the holy land at that time the archaeologist william f albright writing even earlier saw camel in the bible a an anachronismthe official report by and note the introduction of the dromedary camel camelus dromedarius a a pack animal to the southern levant substantially facilitated trade across the vast desert of arabia promoting both economic and social change eg kohler borowski jasmin this ha generated extensive discussion regarding the date of the earliest domestic camel in the southern levant and beyond eg albright epstein bulliet zarins uerpmann and uerpmann jasmin heide rosen and saidel grigson most scholar today agree that the dromedary wa exploited a a pack animal sometime in the early iron age not before the century bc and concludes current data from copper smelting site of the aravah valley enable u to pinpoint the introduction of domestic camel to the southern levant more precisely based on stratigraphic context associated with an extensive suite of radiocarbon date the data indicate that this event occurred not earlier than the last third of the century bc and most probably during this time the coincidence of this event with a major reorganization of the copper industry of the to the result of the campaign of pharaoh shoshenq the possibility that the two were connected and that camel were introduced a part of the effort to improve efficiency by facilitating trade textile desert tribe and mongolian nomad use camel hair for tent yurt clothing bedding and accessory camel have outer guard hair and soft inner down and the fiber are sorted by color and age of the animal the guard hair can be felted for use a waterproof coat for the herdsman while the softer hair is used for premium good the fiber can be spun for use in weaving or made into yarn for hand knitting or crochet pure camel hair is recorded a being used for western garment from the century onwards and from the century a mixture of wool and camel hair wa used military us by at least bc the first camel saddle had appeared and bactrian camel could be ridden the first saddle wa positioned to the back of the camel and control of the bactrian camel wa exercised by mean of a stick however between and bc bactrian camel came into military use new saddle which were inflexible and bent were put over the hump and divided the rider weight over the animal in the seventh century bc the military arabian saddle evolved which again improved the saddle design slightlymilitary force have used camel cavalry in war throughout africa the middle east and into the border security force bsf of india though a of july the bsf planned the replacement of camel with atvs the first documented use of camel cavalry occurred in the battle of qarqar in bc army have also used camel a freight animal instead of horse and mulesthe east roman empire used auxiliary force known a dromedarii whom the roman recruited in desert province the camel were used mostly in combat because of their ability to scare off horse at close range horse are afraid of the camel scent a quality famously employed by the achaemenid persian when fighting lydia in the battle of thymbra bc and century the united state army established the u camel corp stationed in california in the late century one may still see stable at the benicia arsenal in benicia california where they nowadays serve a the benicia historical museum though the experimental use of camel wa seen a a success john b floyd secretary of war in recommended that fund be allocated towards obtaining a thousand more camel the outbreak of the american civil war in saw the end of the camel corp texas became part of the confederacy and most of the camel were left to wander away into the desertfrance created a mehariste camel corp in a part of the armee in the sahara in order to exercise greater control over the tuareg and arab insurgent a previous effort to defeat them on foot had failed the free french camel corp fought during world war ii and unit remained in service until the end of french rule over algeria in the british created the imperial camel corp it wa originally used to fight the senussi but wa later used in the sinai and palestine campaign in world war i the imperial camel corp comprised infantryman mounted on camel for movement across desert though they dismounted at battle site and fought on foot after july the corp began to become run down receiving no new reinforcement and wa formally disbanded in world war i the british army also created the egyptian camel transport corp which consisted of a group of egyptian camel driver and their camel the corp supported british war operation in sinai palestine and syria by transporting supply to the troopsthe somaliland camel corp wa created by colonial authority in british somaliland in it wa disbanded in camel were used by romanian force during world war ii in the caucasian region at the same period the soviet unit operating around astrakhan in adopted local camel a draft animal due to shortage of truck and horse and kept them even after moving out of the area despite severe loss some of these camel came a far west a to berlin itselfthe bikaner camel corp of british india fought alongside the british indian army in world war i and iithe tropas nomadas nomad troop were an auxiliary regiment of sahrawi tribesman serving in the colonial army in spanish sahara today western sahara operational from the until the end of the spanish presence in the territory in the tropas nomadas were equipped with small arm and led by spanish officer the unit guarded outpost and sometimes conducted patrol on camelback food us dairy camel milk is a staple food of desert nomad tribe and is sometimes considered a meal itself a nomad can live on only camel milk for almost a monthcamel milk can readily be made into yogurt but can only be made into butter if it is soured first churned and a clarifying agent is then added until recently camel milk could not be made into camel cheese because rennet wa unable to coagulate the milk protein to allow the collection of curd developing le wasteful us of the milk the fao commissioned professor jp ramet of the ecole nationale superieure et de industry alimentaires who wa able to produce curdling by the addition of calcium phosphate and vegetable rennet in the the cheese produced from this process ha low level of cholesterol and is easy to digest even for the lactose intolerantcamel milk can also be made into ice cream meat they provide food in the form of meat and milk tariq et approximately million camel and camelids are slaughtered each year for meat worldwide a camel carcass can provide a substantial amount of meat the male dromedary carcass can weigh kg lb while the carcass of a male bactrian can weigh up to kg lb the carcass of a female dromedary weighs le than the male ranging between and kg and lb the brisket rib and loin are among the preferred part and the hump is considered a delicacy the hump contains white and sickly fat which can be used to make the khli preserved meat of mutton beef or camel on the other hand camel milk and meat are rich in protein vitamin glycogen and other nutrient making them essential in the diet of many people from chemical composition to meat quality the dromedary camel is the preferred breed for meat production it doe well even in arid area due to it unusual physiological behavior and characteristic which include tolerance to extreme temperature radiation from the sun water paucity rugged landscape and low vegetation camel meat is reported to taste like coarse beef but older camel can prove to be very tough although camel meat becomes tenderer the more it is cooked the abu dhabi officer club serf a camel burger mixed with beef or lamb fat in order to improve the texture and taste in karachi pakistan some restaurant prepare nihari from camel meat specialist camel butcher provide expert cut with the hump considered the most popularcamel meat ha been eaten for century it ha been recorded by ancient greek writer a an available dish at banquet in ancient persia usually roasted whole the roman emperor heliogabalus enjoyed camel heel camel meat is mainly eaten in certain region including eritrea somalia djibouti saudi arabia egypt syria libya sudan ethiopia kazakhstan and other arid region where alternative form of protein may be limited or where camel meat ha had a long cultural history camel blood is also consumable a is the case among pastoralists in northern kenya where camel blood is drunk with milk and act a a key source of iron vitamin d salt and mineralsa report issued jointly by the saudi ministry of health and the united state center for disease control and prevention detail four case of human bubonic plague resulting from the ingestion of raw camel liver australia camel meat is also occasionally found in australian cuisine for example a camel lasagna is available in alice spring australia ha exported camel meat primarily to the middle east but also to europe and the u for many year the meat is very popular among north african australian such a somali and other australian have also been buying it the feral nature of the animal mean they produce a different type of meat to farmed camel in other part of the world and it is sought after because it is and a unique genetic group demand is outstripping supply and government are being urged not to cull the camel but redirect the cost of the cull into developing the market australia ha seven camel dairy which produce milk cheese and skincare product in addition to meat religion islam camel meat is halal arabic for muslim however according to some islamic school of thought a state of impurity is brought on by the consumption of it consequently these school hold that muslim must perform wudhu ablution before the next time they pray after eating camel meat also some islamic school of thought consider it haram arabic for a muslim to perform salat in place where camel lie a it is said to be a dwelling place of the shaytan arabic according to abu yusuf the urine of camel may be used for medical treatment if necessary but according to abu hanifah the drinking of camel urine is discouragedthe islamic text contain several story featuring camel in the story of the people of thamud the prophet salih miraculously brings forth a naqat arabic out of a rock after the prophet muhammad migrated from mecca to medina he allowed his to roam there the location where the camel stopped to rest determined the location where he would build his house in medina judaism according to jewish tradition camel meat and milk are not kosher camel posse only one of the two kosher criterion although they chew their cud they do not posse cloven hoof but these you shall not eat among those that bring up the cud and those that have a cloven hoof the camel because it brings up it cud but doe not have a completely cloven hoof it is unclean for you depiction in culture distribution and number there are around million camel alive a of with being dromedary dromedary alive today are domesticated animal mostly living in the horn of africa the sahel maghreb middle east and south asia the horn region alone ha the largest concentration of camel in the world where the dromedary constitute an important part of local nomadic life they provide nomadic people in somalia and ethiopia with milk food and transportation around dromedary camel are now feral in australia descended from those introduced a a method of transport in the and early century this population is growing about per year representative of the australian government have culled more than of the animal in part because the camel use too much of the limited resource needed by sheep farmersa small population of introduced camel dromedary and bactrians wandered through southwestern united state after having been imported in the century a part of the u camel corp experiment when the project ended they were used a draft animal in mine and escaped or were released u camel were bought and exported to canada during the cariboo gold rushthe bactrian camel is a of reduced to an estimated million animal most of which are domesticated the wild bactrian camel is a separate specie and is the only truly wild a opposed to feral camel in the world the wild camel are
