the coyote canis latrans is a specie of canine native to north america it is smaller than it close relative the wolf and slightly smaller than the closely related eastern wolf and red wolf it fill much of the same ecological niche a the golden jackal doe in eurasia though it is larger and more predatory and it is sometimes called the american jackal by zoologist other name for the specie largely historical include the prairie wolf and the brush wolf the coyote is listed a least concern by the international union for conservation of nature due to it wide distribution and abundance throughout north america southward through mexico and into central america the specie is versatile able to adapt to and expand into environment modified by human it is enlarging it range with coyote moving into urban area in the eastern u and wa sighted in eastern panama across the panama canal from their home range for the first time in the coyote ha recognized subspecies the average male weighs to kg to lb and the average female to kg to lb their fur color is predominantly light gray and red or fulvous interspersed with black and white though it varies somewhat with geography it is highly flexible in social organization living either in a family unit or in loosely knit pack of unrelated individual primarily carnivorous it diet consists mainly of deer rabbit hare rodent bird reptile amphibian fish and invertebrate though it may also eat fruit and vegetable on occasion it characteristic vocalization is a howl made by solitary individual human are the coyote greatest threat followed by cougar and gray wolf in spite of this coyote sometimes mate with gray eastern or red wolf producing coywolf hybrid in the northeastern region of north america the eastern coyote a larger subspecies though still smaller than wolf is the result of various historical and recent mating with various type of wolf genetic study show that most north american wolf contain some level of coyote dna the coyote is a prominent character in native american folklore mainly in aridoamerica usually depicted a a trickster that alternately assumes the form of an actual coyote or a man a with other trickster figure the coyote us deception and humor to rebel against social convention the animal wa especially respected in mesoamerican cosmology a a symbol of military might after the european colonization of the america it wa seen in culture a a cowardly and untrustworthy animal unlike wolf gray eastern or red which have undergone an improvement of their public image attitude towards the coyote remain largely negative description coyote male average to kg to lb in weight while female average to kg to lb though size varies geographically northern subspecies which average kg lb tend to grow larger than the southern subspecies of mexico which average kg lb body length range on average from to m ft in to ft in and tail length cm in with female being shorter in both body length and height the largest coyote on record wa a male killed near afton wyoming on november which measured m ft in from nose to tail and weighed kg lb scent gland are located at the upper side of the base of the tail and are a colorthe color and texture of the coyote fur varies somewhat geographically the hair predominant color is light gray and red or fulvous interspersed around the body with black and white coyote living at high elevation tend to have more black and gray shade than their counterpart which are more fulvous or the coyote fur consists of short soft underfur and long coarse guard hair the fur of northern subspecies is longer and denser than in southern form with the fur of some mexican and central american form being almost hispid bristly generally adult coyote including coywolf hybrid have a sable coat color dark neonatal coat color bushy tail with an active supracaudal gland and a white facial mask albinism is extremely rare in coyote out of a total of coyote killed by federal and cooperative hunter between march and june only two were albinosthe coyote is typically smaller than the gray wolf but ha longer ear and a relatively larger braincase a well a a thinner frame face and muzzle the scent gland are smaller than the gray wolf but are the same color it fur color variation is much le varied than that of a wolf the coyote also carry it tail downwards when running or walking rather than horizontally a the wolf doescoyote track can be distinguished from those of dog by their more elongated le rounded shape unlike dog the upper canine of coyote extend past the mental foramen taxonomy and evolution history at the time of the european colonization of the america coyote were largely confined to open plain and arid region of the western half of the continent in early historical record distinguishing between coyote and wolf is often difficult one record from in kaskaskia illinois written by a local priest noted that the wolf encountered there were smaller and le daring than european wolf another account from the early in edward county mentioned wolf howling at night though these were likely coyote this specie wa encountered several time during the lewis and clark expedition though it wa already well known to european trader on the upper missouri lewis writing on may in northeastern montana described the coyote in these term the small wolf or burrowing dog of the prairie are the inhabitant almost invariably of the open plain they usually associate in band of ten or twelve sometimes more and burrow near some pas or place much frequented by game not being able alone to take deer or goat they are rarely ever found alone but hunt in band they frequently watch and seize their prey near their burrow in these burrow they raise their young and to them they also resort when pursued when a person approach them they frequently bark their note being precisely that of the small dog they are of an intermediate size between that of the fox and dog very active fleet and delicately formed the ear large erect and pointed the head long and pointed more like that of the fox tale long the hair and fur also resembles the fox tho is much coarser and inferior they are of a pale colour the eye of a deep sea green colour small and piercing their claw are reather longer than those of the ordinary wolf or that common to the atlantic state none of which are to be found in this quarter nor i believe above the river plat the coyote wa first scientifically described by naturalist thomas say in september on the site of lewis and clark council bluff km mi up the missouri river from the mouth of the platte during a expedition with major stephen long he had the first edition of the lewis and clark journal in hand which contained biddle edited version of lewis observation dated may his account wa published in say wa the first person to document the difference between a prairie wolf coyote and on the next page of his journal a wolf which he named canis nubilus great plain wolf say described the coyote a canis latrans cinereous or gray varied with black above and dull fulvous or cinnamon hair at base dusky plumbeous in the middle of it length dull cinnamon and at tip gray or black longer on the vertebral line ear erect rounded at tip cinnamon behind the hair dark plumbeous at base inside lined with gray hair eyelid edged with black superior eyelash black beneath and at tip above supplemental lid margined with before and edged with black brown behind iris yellow pupil spot upon the lachrymal sac rostrum cinnamon tinctured with grayish on the nose lip white edged with black three series of black seta head between the ear intermixed with gray and dull cinnamon hair dusky plumbeous at base side paler than the back obsoletely fasciate with black above the leg leg cinnamon on the outer side more distinct on the posterior hair a dilated black abbreviated line on the anterior one near the wrist tail bushy fusiform straight varied with gray and cinnamon a spot near the base above and tip black the tip of the trunk of the tail attains the tip of the o calcis when the leg is extended beneath white immaculate tail cinnamon towards the tip tip black posterior foot four toed anterior five toed naming and etymology the earliest written reference to the specie come from the naturalist francisco hernandez plantas y animales de la nueva espana where it is described a a spanish fox or jackal the first published usage of the word coyote which is a spanish borrowing of it nahuatl name coyotl pronunciation come from the historian francisco javier clavijero historia de mexico in the first time it wa used in english occurred in william bullock six month residence and travel in mexico where it is variously transcribed a cayjotte and cocyotie the word spelling wa standardized a coyote by the alternative english name for the coyote include prairie wolf brush wolf cased wolf little wolf and american jackal it binomial name canis latrans translates to barking dog a reference to the many vocalization they produce local and indigenous name for canis latrans evolution fossil record xiaoming wang and richard h tedford one of the foremost authority on carnivore evolution proposed that the genus canis wa the descendant of the eucyon davisi and it remains first appeared in the miocene million year ago mya in the southwestern u and mexico by the pliocene mya the larger canis lepophagus appeared in the same region and by the early pleistocene mya c latrans the coyote wa in existence they proposed that the progression from eucyon davisi to c lepophagus to the coyote wa linear evolution additionally c latrans and c aureus are closely related to c edwardii a specie that appeared earliest spanning the late pliocene to the close of the irvingtonian late pleistocene and coyote remains indistinguishable from c latrans were contemporaneous with c edwardii in north america johnston describes c lepophagus a having a more slender skull and skeleton than the modern coyote ronald nowak found that the early population had small delicate narrowly proportioned skull that resemble small coyote and appear to be ancestral to c latransc lepophagus wa similar in weight to modern coyote but had shorter limb bone that indicates a le cursorial lifestyle the coyote represents a more primitive form of canis than the gray wolf a shown by it relatively small size and it comparatively narrow skull and jaw which lack the grasping power necessary to hold the large prey in which wolf specialize this is further corroborated by the coyote sagittal crest which is low or totally flattened thus indicating a weaker bite than the wolf the coyote is not a specialized carnivore a the wolf is a shown by the larger chewing surface on the molar reflecting the specie relative dependence on vegetable matter in these respect the coyote resembles the progenitor of the genus more so than the wolfthe oldest fossil that fall within the range of the modern coyote date to ma million year in hamilton cave west virginia ma in irvington california ma in porcupine cave colorado and in cumberland cave pennsylvania modern coyote arose year after the quaternary extinction event compared to their modern holocene counterpart pleistocene coyote c l orcutti were larger and more robust likely in response to larger competitor and prey pleistocene coyote were likely more specialized carnivore than their descendant a their teeth were more adapted to shearing meat showing fewer grinding surface suited for processing vegetation their reduction in size occurred within year of the quaternary extinction event when their large prey died out furthermore pleistocene coyote were unable to exploit the hunting niche left vacant after the extinction of the dire wolf c dirus a it wa rapidly filled by gray wolf which likely actively killed off the large coyote with natural selection favoring the modern gracile morph dna evidence in a study proposed that the wolf of north america display skull trait more similar to the coyote than wolf from eurasia in a study found that the coyote wa a basal member of the clade that included the tibetan wolf the domestic dog the mongolian wolf and the eurasian wolf with the tibetan wolf diverging early from wolf and domestic dog in a dna study proposed based on the assumption made that all of the north american wolf and coyote diverged from a common ancestor le than year ago the study also indicated that all north american wolf have a significant amount of coyote ancestry and all coyote some degree of wolf ancestry and that the red wolf and eastern wolf are highly admixed with different proportion of gray wolf and coyote ancestry the proposed timing of the divergence conflict with the finding of a specimen in stratum dated to myagenetic study relating to wolf or dog have inferred phylogenetic relationship based on the only reference genome available that of the boxer dog in the first reference genome of the wolf canis lupus lupus wa mapped to aid future research in a study looked at the genomic structure and admixture of north american wolf canid and coyote using specimen from across their entire range that mapped the largest dataset of nuclear genome sequence against the wolf reference genome the study support the finding of previous study that north american gray wolf and canid were the result of complex gray wolf and coyote mixing a polar wolf from greenland and a coyote from mexico represented the purest specimen the coyote from alaska california alabama and quebec show almost no wolf ancestry coyote from missouri illinois and florida exhibit wolf ancestry there wa wolf to coyote ancestry in red wolf in eastern timber wolf and in the great lake wolf there wa coyote ancestry in mexican wolf and the atlantic coast wolf in pacific coast and yellowstone wolf and le than in canadian archipelago wolf if a third canid had been involved in the admixture of the north american canid then it genetic signature would have been found in coyote and wolf which it ha notin whole genome sequencing wa used to compare member of genus canis the study indicates that the common ancestor of the coyote and gray wolf ha genetically admixed with a ghost population of an extinct unidentified canid the canid wa genetically close to the dhole and had evolved after the divergence of the african wild dog from the other canid specie the basal position of the coyote compared to the wolf is proposed to be due to the coyote retaining more of the mitochondrial genome of this unknown canid subspecies a of subspecies are recognized geographic variation in coyote is not great though taken a a whole the eastern subspecies c l thamnos and c l frustor are large animal with a gradual paling in color and reduction in size westward and northward c l texensis c l latrans c l lestes and c l incolatus a brightening of ochraceous orange or the pacific coast c l ochropus c l umpquensis a reduction in size in aridoamerica c l microdon c l mearnsi and a general trend towards dark reddish color and short muzzle in mexican and central american population hybridization coyote have occasionally mated with domestic dog sometimes producing cross colloquially known a coydog such mating are rare in the wild a the mating cycle of dog and coyote do not coincide and coyote are usually antagonistic towards dog hybridization usually only occurs when coyote are expanding into area where conspecific are few and dog are the only alternative even then pup survival rate are lower than normal a dog do not form pair bond with coyote thus making the rearing of pup more difficult in captivity hybrid first generation tend to be more mischievous and le manageable a pup than dog and are le trustworthy on maturity than hybrid hybrid vary in appearance but generally retain the coyote usual characteristic hybrid tend to be intermediate in form between dog and coyote while hybrid second generation are more varied both and hybrid resemble their coyote parent in term of shyness and intrasexual aggression hybrid are fertile and can be successfully bred through four generation melanistic coyote owe their black pelt to a mutation that first arose in domestic dog a population of nonalbino white coyote in newfoundland owe their coloration to a melanocortin receptor mutation inherited from golden retriever coyote have hybridized with wolf to varying degree particularly in eastern north america the eastern coyote of northeastern north america probably originated in the aftermath of the extermination of gray and eastern wolf in the northeast thus allowing coyote to colonize former wolf range and mix with the remnant wolf population this hybrid is smaller than either the gray or eastern wolf and hold smaller territory but is in turn larger and hold more extensive home range than the typical western coyote a of the eastern coyote genetic makeup is fairly uniform with minimal influence from eastern wolf or western coyote adult eastern coyote are larger than western coyote with female eastern coyote weighing more than male western coyote physical difference become more apparent by the age of day with eastern coyote pup having longer leg than their western counterpart difference in dental development also occurs with tooth eruption being later and in a different order in the eastern coyote aside from it size the eastern coyote is physically similar to the western coyote the four color phase range from dark brown to blond or reddish blond though the most common phase is with reddish leg ear and flank no significant difference exist between eastern and western coyote in aggression and fighting though eastern coyote tend to fight le and are more playful unlike western coyote pup in which fighting precedes play behavior fighting among eastern coyote pup occurs after the onset of play eastern coyote tend to reach sexual maturity at two year of age much later than in western coyoteseastern and red wolf are also product of varying degree of hybridization the eastern wolf probably wa a result of a admixture combined with extensive backcrossing with parent gray wolf population the red wolf may have originated during a time of declining wolf population in the southeastern woodland forcing a hybridization a well a backcrossing with local parent coyote population to the extent that about of the modern red wolf genome is of coyote derivation behavior social and reproductive behavior like the eurasian golden jackal the coyote is gregarious but not a dependent on conspecific a more social canid specie like wolf are this is likely because the coyote is not a specialized hunter of large prey a the latter specie is the basic social unit of a coyote pack is a family containing a reproductive female however unrelated coyote may join force for companionship or to bring down prey too large to attack singly such nonfamily pack are only temporary and may consist of bachelor male nonreproductive female and subadult young family are formed in midwinter when female enter estrus pair bonding can occur month before actual copulation take place the copulatory tie can last minute a female entering estrus attracts male by scent marking and howling with increasing frequency a single female in heat can attract up to seven reproductive male which can follow her for a long a a month although some squabbling may occur among the male once the female ha selected a mate and copulates the rejected male do not intervene and move on once they detect other estrous female unlike the wolf which ha been known to practice both monogamous and bigamous mating the coyote is strictly monogamous even in area with high coyote density and abundant food female that fail to mate sometimes assist their sister or mother in raising their pup or join their sibling until the next time they can mate the newly mated pair then establishes a territory and either construct their own den or clean out abandoned badger marmot or skunk earth during the pregnancy the male frequently hunt alone and brings back food for the female the female may line the den with dried grass or with fur pulled from her belly the gestation period is day with an average litter size of six though the number fluctuates depending on coyote population density and the abundance of foodcoyote pup are born in den hollow tree or under ledge and weigh to g to lb at birth they are altricial and are completely dependent on milk for their first day the incisor erupt at about day the canine at and the second premolar at their eye open after day by which point the pup become increasingly more mobile walking by day and running at the age of six week the parent begin supplementing the pup diet with regurgitated solid food after day by the age of four to six week when their milk teeth are fully functional the pup are given small food item such a mouse rabbit or piece of ungulate carcass with lactation steadily decreasing after two month unlike wolf pup coyote pup begin seriously fighting a opposed to play fighting prior to engaging in play behavior a common play behavior includes the coyote by three week of age coyote pup bite each other with le inhibition than wolf pup by the age of four to five week pup have established dominance hierarchy and are by then more likely to play rather than fight the male play an active role in feeding grooming and guarding the pup but abandon them if the female go missing before the pup are completely weaned the den is abandoned by june to july and the pup follow their parent in patrolling their territory and hunting pup may leave their family in august though can remain for much longer the pup attain adult dimension at eight month and gain adult weight a month later territorial and sheltering behavior individual feeding territory vary in size from to to sq mi with the general concentration of coyote in a given area depending on food abundance adequate denning site and competition with conspecific and other predator the coyote generally doe not defend it territory outside of the denning season and is much le aggressive towards intruder than the wolf is typically chasing and sparring with them but rarely killing them conflict between coyote can arise during time of food shortage coyote mark their territory by urination and wolf coyote use a den usually the deserted hole of other specie when gestating and rearing young though they may occasionally give birth under sagebrush in the open coyote den can be located in canyon washout coulees bank rock bluff or level ground some den have been found under abandoned homestead shack grain bin drainage pipe railroad track hollow log thicket and thistle the den is continuously dug and cleaned out by the female until the pup are born should the den be disturbed or infested with flea the pup are moved into another den a coyote den can have several entrance and passage branching out from the main chamber a single den can be used year after year hunting and feeding behavior while the popular consensus is that olfaction is very important for hunting two study that experimentally investigated the role of olfactory auditory and visual cue found that visual cue are the most important one for hunting in red fox and coyote when hunting large prey the coyote often work in pair or small group success in killing large ungulate depends on factor such a snow depth and crust density younger animal usually avoid participating in such hunt with the breeding pair typically doing most of the work unlike the wolf which attack large prey from the rear the coyote approach from the front lacerating it prey head and throat like other canid the coyote cache excess food coyote catch rodent by pouncing whereas ground squirrel are chased although coyote can live in large group small prey is typically caught singly coyote have been observed to kill porcupine in pair using their paw to flip the rodent on their back then attacking the soft underbelly only old and experienced coyote can successfully prey on porcupine with many predation attempt by young coyote resulting in them being injured by their prey quill coyote sometimes urinate on their food possibly to claim ownership over it recent evidence demonstrates that at least some coyote have become more nocturnal in hunting presumably to avoid humanscoyotes may occasionally form mutualistic hunting relationship with american badger assisting each other in digging up rodent prey the relationship between the two specie may occasionally border on apparent friendship a some coyote have been observed laying their head on their badger companion or licking their face without protest the amicable interaction between coyote and badger were known to civilization a shown on a mexican jar dated to ce depicting the relationship between the twofood scrap pet food and animal feces may attract a coyote to a trash can communication body language being both a gregarious and solitary animal the variability of the coyote visual and vocal repertoire is intermediate between that of the solitary fox and the highly social wolf the aggressive behavior of the coyote bear more similarity to that of fox than it doe that of wolf and dog an aggressive coyote arch it back and lower it tail unlike dog which solicit playful behavior by performing a followed by a play in coyote consists of a bow followed by head flexion and a series of spin and dive although coyote will sometimes bite their playmate scruff a dog do they typically approach low and make bite pup fight each other regardless of sex while among adult aggression is typically reserved for member of the same sex combatant approach each other waving their tail and snarling with their jaw open though fight are typically silent male tend to fight in a vertical stance while female fight on all four paw fight among female tend to be more serious than one among male a female seize their opponent foreleg throat and shoulder vocalization the coyote ha been described a the most vocal of all wild north american mammal it loudness and range of vocalization wa the cause for it binomial name canis latrans meaning barking dog at least different vocalization are known in adult coyote these sound are divided into three category agonistic and alarm greeting and contact vocalization of the first category include woof growl huff bark bark howl yelp and whine woof are used a threat or alarm and are usually heard near den site prompting the pup to immediately retreat into their burrow growl are used a threat at short distance but have also been heard among pup playing and copulating male huff are threat vocalization produced by rapid expiration of air bark can be classed a both threat vocalization and a alarm call bark howl may serve similar function yelp are emitted a a sign of submission while whine are produced by dominant animal acknowledging the submission of subordinate greeting vocalization include whine and group yip howl whine are emitted by submissive animal and are usually accompanied by tail wagging and muzzle nibbling the sound known a ha been described a a greeting song the group yip howl is emitted when two or more pack member reunite and may be the final act of a complex greeting ceremony contact call include lone howl and group howl a well a the previously mentioned group yip howl the lone howl is the most iconic sound of the coyote and may serve the purpose of announcing the presence of a lone individual separated from it pack group howl are used a both substitute group yip howl and a response to either lone howl group howl or group yip howl ecology habitat prior to the near extermination of wolf and cougar the coyote wa most numerous in grassland inhabited by bison pronghorn elk and other deer doing particularly well in area with prairie dog though it wa just a much at home in semiarid area with sagebrush and jackrabbit or in desert inhabited by cactus kangaroo rat and rattlesnake a long a it wa not in direct competition with the wolf the coyote ranged from the sonoran desert to the alpine region of adjoining mountain or the plain and mountainous area of alberta with the extermination of the wolf the coyote range expanded to encompass broken forest from the tropic of guatemala and the northern slope of alaskacoyotes walk around kilometre mi per day often along trail such a logging road and path they may use river a travel route in winter they are often crepuscular being more active around evening and the beginning of the night than during the day like many canid coyote are competent swimmer reported to be able to travel at least kilometre mi across water diet the coyote is ecologically the north american equivalent of the eurasian golden jackal likewise the coyote is highly versatile in it choice of food but is primarily carnivorous with of it diet consisting of meat prey specie include bison largely a carrion deer mule deer moose elk bighorn sheep pronghorn rabbit hare rodent bird especially galliforms young water bird and pigeon and dove amphibian except toad lizard snake turtle and tortoise fish crustacean and insect coyote may be picky over the prey they target a animal such a shrew mole and brown rat do not occur in their diet in proportion to their number however terrestrial burrowing small mammal such a ground squirrel and associated specie marmot prairie dog chipmunk a well a vole pocket gopher kangaroo rat and other rodent may be quite common food especially for lone coyote more unusual prey include fisher young black bear cub harp seal and rattlesnake coyote kill rattlesnake mostly for food but also to protect their pup at their den by teasing the snake until they stretch out and then biting their head and snapping and shaking the snake bird taken by coyote may range in size from thrasher lark and sparrow to adult wild turkey and possibly brooding adult swan and pelican if working in pack or pair coyote may have access to larger prey than lone individual normally take such a various prey weighing more than kg lb in some case pack of coyote have dispatched much larger prey such a adult odocoileus deer cow elk pronghorn and wild sheep although the young fawn calf and lamb of these animal are considerably more often taken even by pack a well a domestic sheep and domestic cattle in some case coyote can bring down prey weighing up to to kg to lb or more when it come to adult ungulate such a wild deer they often exploit them when vulnerable such a those that are infirm stuck in snow or ice otherwise or heavily pregnant whereas le wary domestic ungulate may be more easily exploitedalthough coyote prefer fresh meat they will scavenge when the opportunity present itself excluding the insect fruit and grass eaten the coyote requires an estimated g lb of food daily or kg lb annually the coyote readily cannibalizes the carcass of conspecific with coyote fat having been successfully used by coyote hunter a a lure or poisoned bait the coyote winter diet consists mainly of large ungulate carcass with very little plant matter rodent prey increase in importance during the spring summer and fallthe coyote feed on a variety of different produce including blackberry blueberry peach pear apple prickly pear chapotes persimmon peanut watermelon cantaloupe and carrot during the winter and early spring the coyote eats large quantity of grass such a green wheat blade it sometimes eats unusual item such a cotton cake soybean meal domestic animal droppings bean and cultivated grain such a maize wheat and sorghumin coastal california coyote now consume a higher percentage of food than their ancestor which is thought to be due to the extirpation of the grizzly bear from this region in death valley coyote may consume great quantity of hawkmoth caterpillar or beetle in the spring flowering month enemy and competitor in area where the range of coyote and gray wolf overlap interference competition and predation by wolf ha been hypothesized to limit local coyote density coyote range expanded during the and century following the extirpation of wolf while coyote were driven to extinction on isle royale after wolf colonized the island in the one study conducted in yellowstone national park where both specie coexist concluded that the coyote population in the lamar river valley declined by following the reintroduction of wolf in the while coyote population in wolf inhabited area of the grand teton national park are lower than in area where they are absent wolf have been observed to not tolerate coyote in their vicinity though coyote have been known to trail wolf to feed on their killscoyotes may compete with cougar in some area in the eastern sierra nevada coyote compete with cougar over mule deer cougar normally outcompete and dominate coyote and may kill them occasionally thus reducing coyote predation pressure on smaller carnivore such a fox and bobcat coyote that are killed are sometimes not eaten perhaps indicating that these compromise competitive interspecies interaction however there are multiple confirmed case of cougar also eating coyote in northeastern mexico cougar predation on coyote continues apace but coyote were absent from the prey spectrum of sympatric jaguar apparently due to differing habitat usagesother than by gray wolf and cougar predation on adult coyote is relatively rare but multiple other predator can be occasional threat in some case adult coyote have been preyed upon by both american black and grizzly bear american alligator large canada lynx and golden eagle at kill site and carrion coyote especially if working alone tend to be dominated by wolf cougar bear wolverine and usually but not always eagle ie bald and golden when such larger more powerful more aggressive predator such a these come to a shared feeding site a coyote may either try to fight wait until the other predator is done or occasionally share a kill but if a major danger such a wolf or an adult cougar is present the coyote will tend to fleecoyotes rarely kill healthy adult red fox and have been observed to feed or den alongside them though they often kill fox caught in trap coyote may kill fox kit but this is not a major source of mortality in southern california coyote frequently kill gray fox and these smaller canid tend to avoid area with high coyote densitiesin some area coyote share their range with bobcat these two specie rarely physically confront one another though bobcat population tend to diminish in area with high coyote density however several study have demonstrated interference competition between coyote and bobcat and in all case coyote dominated the interaction multiple researcher reported instance of coyote killing bobcat whereas bobcat killing coyote is more rare coyote attack bobcat using a method similar to what is used on prey coyote both single individual and group have been known to occasionally kill bobcat in most case the bobcat were relatively small specimen such a adult female and juvenile however coyote attack by an unknown number of coyote on adult male bobcat have occurred in california coyote and bobcat population are not negatively correlated across different habitat type but predation by coyote is an important source of mortality in bobcat biologist stanley paul young noted that in his entire trapping career he had never successfully saved a captured bobcat from being killed by coyote and wrote of two incident wherein coyote chased bobcat up tree coyote have been documented to directly kill canada lynx on occasion and compete with them for prey especially snowshoe hare in some area including central alberta lynx are more abundant where coyote are few thus interaction with coyote appears to influence lynx population more than the availability of snowshoe hare range due to the coyote wide range and abundance throughout north america it is listed a least concern by the international union for conservation of nature iucn the coyote range wa limited to the southwest and plain region of north america and northern and central mexico by the century the specie expanded north and east expanding further after coinciding with land conversion and the extirpation of wolf by this time it range encompassed the entire north american continent including all of the contiguous united state and mexico southward into central america and northward into most of canada and alaska this expansion is ongoing and the specie now occupies the majority of area between panama and northern alaska although it wa once widely believed that coyote are recent immigrant to southern mexico and central america aided in their expansion by deforestation pleistocene and early holocene record a well a record from the period and early european colonization show that the animal wa present in the area long before modern time nevertheless range expansion did occur south of costa rica during the late and northern panama in the early following the expansion of land into tropical rain forest the coyote is predicted to appear in northern belize in the near future a the habitat there is favorable to the specie concern have been raised of a possible expansion into south america through the panamanian isthmus should the darien gap ever be closed by the highway this fear wa partially confirmed in january when the specie wa recorded in eastern panama chepo district beyond the panama canala genetic study proposes that coyote were originally not found in the area of the eastern united state from the dense forest were transformed into agricultural land and wolf control implemented on a large scale leaving a niche for coyote to disperse into there were two major dispersal from two population of genetically distinct coyote the first major dispersal to the northeast came in the early century from those coyote living in the northern great plain these came to new england via the northern great lake region and southern canada and to pennsylvania via the southern great lake region meeting together in the in new york and pennsylvania these coyote have hybridized with the remnant gray wolf and eastern wolf population which ha added to coyote genetic diversity and may have assisted adaptation to the new niche the second major dispersal to the southeast came in the century from texas and reached the carolina in the these coyote have hybridized with the remnant red wolf population before the when the red wolf wa extirpated in the wild which ha also added to coyote genetic diversity and may have assisted adaptation to this new niche a well both of these two major coyote dispersal have experienced rapid population growth and are forecast to meet along the coast the study concludes that for coyote the long range dispersal gene flow from local population and rapid population growth may be disease and parasite among large north american carnivore the coyote probably carry the largest number of disease and parasite likely due to it wide range and varied diet viral disease known to infect coyote include rabies canine distemper infectious canine hepatitis four strain of equine encephalitis and oral papillomatosis by the late serious rabies outbreak in coyote had ceased to be a problem for over year though sporadic case every year did occur distemper cause the death of many pup in the wild though some specimen can survive infection tularemia a bacterial disease infects coyote from tick bite and through their rodent and lagomorph prey and can be deadly for pupscoyotes can be infected by both demodectic and sarcoptic mange the latter being the most common mite infestation are rare and incidental in coyote while tick infestation are more common with seasonal peak depending on locality in the northwest in arkansas coyote are only rarely infested with louse while flea infest coyote from puphood though they may be more a source of irritation than serious illness pulex simulans is the most common specie to infest coyote while ctenocephalides canis tends to occur only in place where coyote and dog it primary host inhabit the same area although coyote are rarely host to fluke they can nevertheless have serious effect on coyote particularly nanophyetus salmincola which can infect them with salmon poisoning disease a disease with a mortality rate trematode metorchis conjunctus can also infect coyote tapeworm have been recorded to infest of all coyote examined the most common specie to infest coyote are taenia pisiformis and taenia crassiceps which us cottontail rabbit a intermediate host the largest specie known in coyote is t hydatigena which enters coyote through infected ungulate and can grow to length of to cm to in although once largely limited to wolf echinococcus granulosus ha expanded to coyote since the latter began colonizing former wolf range the most frequent ascaroid roundworm in coyote is toxascaris leonina which dwells in the coyote small intestine and ha no ill effect except for causing the host to eat more frequently hookworm of the genus ancylostoma infest coyote throughout their range being particularly prevalent in humid area in area of high moisture such a coastal texas coyote can carry up to hookworm each the a caninum is particularly dangerous a it damage the coyote through blood loss and lung congestion a pup can die from being host to a few a a caninum worm relationship with human in folklore and mythology coyote feature a a trickster figure and in the folktale of some native american notably several nation in the southwestern and plain region where he alternately assumes the form of an actual coyote or that of a man a with other trickster figure coyote act a a picaresque hero who rebel against social convention through deception and humor folklorists such a harris believe coyote came to be seen a trickster due to the animal intelligence and adaptability after the european colonization of the america depiction of coyote are of a cowardly and untrustworthy animal unlike the gray wolf which ha undergone a radical improvement of it public image cultural attitude towards the coyote remain largely negativein the maidu creation story coyote introduces work suffering and death to the world zuni lore ha coyote bringing winter into the world by stealing light from the kachina the chinook maidu pawnee tohono and ute portray the coyote a the companion of the creator a
