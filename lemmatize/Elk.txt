the elk cervus canadensis or wapiti is one of the largest specie within the deer family cervidae and one of the largest terrestrial mammal in north america and northeast asia this animal should not be confused with the still larger moose alces alces of north america alternatively known a elk in british english and related name in other european language german elch danish elg french elan in reference to population in eurasia elk range in forest and habitat feeding on grass plant leaf and bark male elk have large antler which are shed each year male also engage in ritualized mating behavior during the rut including posturing antler wrestling sparring and bugling a loud series of vocalization that establishes dominance over other male and attracts female although it is currently native to north america and eastern asia it had a much wider distribution in the past population were present across eurasia into western europe during the late pleistocene and survived into the early holocene in southern sweden and the alp the elk ha adapted well in country where it ha been introduced including argentina and new zealand it adaptability may in fact threaten endemic specie and the ecosystem into which it ha been introduced elk are susceptible to a number of infectious disease some of which can be transmitted to livestock effort to eliminate infectious disease from elk population largely by vaccination have had mixed success some culture revere the elk a having spiritual significance in part of asia antler and their velvet are used in traditional medicine elk are hunted a a game specie their meat is leaner and higher in protein than beef or chicken elk were long believed to belong to a subspecies of the european red deer cervus elaphus but evidence from many mitochondrial dna genetic study beginning in show that the two are distinct specie key morphological difference that distinguish c canadensis from c elaphus are the former wider rump patch and antler naming and etymology early european explorer in north america who were familiar with the smaller red deer of europe thought that the larger north american animal resembled a moose and consequently gave it the name elk which is the common european name for moose the word elk is related to the latin alces old norse elgr scandinavian and german elch all of which refer to the animal known in north america a the moosethe name wapiti is from the shawnee and cree word waapiti meaning white rump this name is used in particular for the asian subspecies the altai wapiti tian shan wapiti manchurian wapiti and alashan wapiti because in eurasia the name elk continues to be used for the moose the asian subspecies are sometimes referred to a the maral but this name applies primarily to the caspian red deer cervus elaphus maral a subspecies of the red deer there is a subspecies of wapiti in mongolia called the altai wapiti cervus canadensis sibiricus also known a the altai maral taxonomy member of the genus cervus and hence early relative or possible ancestor of the elk first appear in the fossil record million year ago during the oligocene in eurasia but do not appear in the north american fossil record until the early miocene the extinct irish elk megaloceros wa not a member of the genus cervus but rather the largest member of the wider deer family cervidae known from the fossil recorduntil recently red deer and elk were considered to be one specie cervus elaphus however mitochondrial dna study conducted on hundred of sample in from red deer and elk subspecies a well a other specie of the cervus deer family strongly indicate that elk or wapiti should be a distinct specie namely cervus canadensis the previous classification had over a dozen subspecies under the c elaphus specie designation dna evidence concludes that elk are more closely related to thorold deer and even sika deer than they are to the red deer elk and red deer produce fertile offspring in captivity and the two specie have freely in new zealand fiordland national park where the animal have all but removed the pure elk blood from the area key morphological difference that distinguish c canadensis from c elaphus are the former wider rump patch and antler subspecies there are numerous subspecies of elk described with six from north america and four from asia although some taxonomist consider them different ecotypes or race of the same specie adapted to local environment through minor change in appearance and behavior population vary in antler shape and size body size coloration and mating behavior dna investigation of the eurasian subspecies revealed that phenotypic variation in antler mane and rump patch development are based on lifestyle factor of the six subspecies of elk known to have inhabited north america in historical time four remain including the roosevelt c canadensis roosevelti tule c canadensis nannodes manitoban c canadensis manitobensis and rocky mountain elk c canadensis nelsoni the eastern elk c canadensis canadensis and merriam elk c canadensis merriami subspecies have been extinct for at least a centuryfour subspecies described in asia include the altai wapiti c canadensis sibiricus and the tianshan wapiti c canadensis songaricus two distinct subspecies found in china and korea are the manchurian wapiti c canadensis xanthopygus and the alashan wapiti c canadensis alashanicus the manchurian wapiti is darker and more reddish in coloration than the other population the alashan wapiti of north central china is the smallest of all subspecies ha the lightest coloration and is the least studied biologist valerius geist who ha written on the world various deer specie hold that there are only three subspecies of elk geist recognizes the manchurian and alashan wapiti but place all other elk into c canadensis canadensis claiming that classification of the four surviving north american group a subspecies is driven at least partly for political purpose to secure individualized conservation and protective measure for each of the surviving populationsrecent dna study suggest that there are no more than three or four subspecies of elk all american form aside from possibly the tule and roosevelt elk seem to belong to one subspecies cervus canadensis canadensis even the siberian elk cervus canadensis sibiricus are more or le identical to the american form and therefore may belong to this subspecies too however the manchurian wapiti cervus canadensis xanthopygus is clearly distinct from the siberian form but not distinguishable from the alashan wapiti the chinese form the sichuan deer kansu red deer and tibetan red deer belong also to the wapiti and were not distinguishable from each other by mitochondrial dna study these chinese subspecies are sometimes treated a a distinct specie namely the central asian red deer cervus wallichi which also includes the kashmir stag north american group roosevelt elk c c roosevelti tule elk c c nannodes manitoban elk c c manitobensis rocky mountain elk c c nelsoni eastern elk c c canadensis extinct merriam elk c c merriami extinct eastern group altai wapiti c c sibiricus tian shan wapiti c

wallichii kashmir stag c c hanglu anatomy the elk is a large animal of the ungulate order artiodactyla possessing an even number of toe on each foot similar to those of camel goat and cattle it is a ruminant specie with a stomach and feed on grass plant leaf and bark during the summer elk eat almost constantly consuming between and kilogram and lb of vegetation daily in north america male are called bull and female are called cow in asia stag and hind respectively are sometimes used instead elk are more than twice a heavy a mule deer and have a more reddish hue to their hair coloring a well a large rump patch and smaller tail moose are larger and darker than elk bull have distinctively different antler elk gather in herd while moose are solitary elk cow average to kg to lb stand m ft at the wither and are m ft from nose to tail bull are some larger than cow at maturity weighing an average of to kg to lb standing m ft at the wither and averaging m ft in length while large male reach m ft tall at wither and m ft in length the largest of the subspecies is the roosevelt elk c c roosevelti found west of the cascade range in the u state of california oregon and washington and in the canadian province of british columbia roosevelt elk have been reintroduced into alaska where the largest male are estimated to weigh up to kg lb more typically male roosevelt elk weigh around to kg to lb while female weigh to kg to lb the subspecies is the tule elk c c nannodes which weighs from to kg to lb in both sexesonly the male have antler which start growing in the spring and are shed each winter the largest antler may be meter ft long and weigh kilogram lb antler are made of bone which can grow at a rate of centimeter in per day while actively growing the antler are covered with and protected by a soft layer of highly vascularised skin known a velvet the velvet is shed in the summer when the antler have fully developed bull elk may have eight or more tine on each antler however the number of tine ha little to do with the age or maturity of a particular animal the siberian and north american elk carry the largest antler while the altai wapiti have the smallest the formation and retention of antler is after the breeding season in late fall the level of pheromone released during estrus decline in the environment and the testosterone level of male drop a a consequence this drop in testosterone lead to the shedding of antler usually in the early winter during the fall elk grow a thicker coat of hair which help to insulate them during the winter male female and calf of siberian and north american elk all grow thin neck mane female and young manchurian and alaskan wapiti do not by early summer the heavy winter coat ha been shed and elk are known to rub against tree and other object to help remove hair from their body all elk have small and clearly defined rump patch with short tail they have different coloration based on the season and type of habitat with gray or lighter coloration prevalent in the winter and a more reddish darker coat in the summer subspecies living in arid climate tend to have lighter colored coat than do those living in forest most have lighter to coat in contrast to dark brown hair on the head neck and leg during the summer manchurian and alaskan wapiti have darker coat with le contrast between the body coat and the rest of the body during the summer month calf are born spotted a is common with many deer specie and they lose their spot by the end of summer adult manchurian wapiti may retain a few orange spot on the back of their summer coat until they are older this characteristic ha also been observed in the european red deer behavior adult elk usually stay in group for most of the year during the mating period known a the rut mature bull compete for the attention of the cow elk and will try to fend off rival bull from their harem rival bull challenge opponent by bellowing or bugling and by paralleling each other walking back and forth this allows potential combatant to ass the other antler body size and fighting prowess if neither bull back down they engage in antler wrestling and bull sometimes sustain serious injury bull also dig hole in the ground called wallow in which they urinate and roll their body a male elk urethra point upward so that urine is sprayed almost at a right angle to the penis the urine soak into their hair and give them a distinct smell which attracts cowsdominant bull follow group of cow during the rut from august into early winter a bull will defend his harem of cow or more from competing bull and predator it is only the mature bull that usually have large harem and breeding success peak at about eight year of age bull between two and four year and over year of age rarely have harem and spend most of the rut on the periphery of larger harem young and old bull that do acquire a harem usually acquire it later in the breeding season than do bull in their prime a bull with a harem rarely feed and he may lose up to percent of his body weight during the rut bull that enter the rut in poor condition are le likely to keep their harem through to the peak conception period or have the strength to survive the rigor of the oncoming winterbulls have a loud vocalization consisting of scream known a bugling which can be heard for mile bugling is often associated with an adaptation to open environment such a parkland meadow and savanna where sound can travel great distance female are attracted to the male that bugle more often and have the loudest call unusual for a vocalization produced by a large animal buglings can reach a frequency of hz this is achieved by blowing air from the glottis through the nasal cavity elk can produce deeper pitched hz sound using the larynx reproduction and lifecycle female elk have a short estrus cycle of only a day or two and mating usually involve a dozen or more attempt by the autumn of their second year female can produce one and very rarely two offspring although reproduction is most common when cow weigh at least kilogram lb the gestation period is to day and the offspring weigh between and kilogram and lb when the female are near to giving birth they tend to isolate themselves from the main herd and will remain isolated until the calf is large enough to escape predator calf are born spotted a is common with many deer specie and they lose their spot by the end of summer manchurian wapiti may retain a few orange spot on the back of their summer coat until they are older after two week calf are able to join the herd and are fully weaned at two month of age elk calf are a large a an adult deer by the time they are six month old the offspring will remain with their mother for almost a year leaving about the time that the next season offspring are produced the gestation period is the same for all subspecies elk live year or more in captivity but average to year in the wild in some subspecies that suffer le predation they may live an average of year in the wild predator and defensive tactic in north america wolf and coyote pack and the solitary cougar are the most likely predator although brown and black bear also prey on elk coyote pack mostly prey on elk calf though they can sometimes take a or adult in the greater yellowstone ecosystem which includes yellowstone national park bear are the most significant predator of calf although grizzly have been documented to hunt elk there are no documented case when mature healthy bull are killed by grizzly however they do occasionally kill the bear insteadmale elk retain their antler for more than half the year and are le likely to group with other male when they have antler antler provide a mean of defense a doe a strong kick which is performed by either sex if provoked once the antler have been shed bull tend to form bachelor group which allow them to work cooperatively at fending off predator herd tend to employ one or more scout while the remaining member eat and restafter the rut female form large herd of up to individual newborn calf are kept close by a series of vocalization larger nursery have an ongoing and constant chatter during the daytime hour when approached by predator the largest and most robust female may make a stand using their front leg to kick at their attacker guttural grunt and posturing effectively deter all but the most determined predatorswapiti in new zealand have no natural predator migration a is true for many specie of deer especially those in mountainous region elk migrate into area of higher altitude in the spring following the retreating snow and the opposite direction in the fall hunting pressure also impact migration and movement during the winter they favor wooded area and sheltered valley for protection from the wind and availability of tree bark to eat roosevelt elk are generally due to le seasonal variability of food sourcesthe greater yellowstone ecosystem elk herd number over individual and during the spring and fall they take part in the longest elk migration in the continental u elk in the southern region of yellowstone national park and in the surrounding national forest migrate south towards the town of jackson wyoming where they winter for up to six month on the national elk refuge conservationist there ensure the herd is well fed during the harsh winter many of the elk that reside in the northern section of the greater yellowstone ecosystem migrate to lower altitude in montana mainly to the north and west diet elk are ruminant and therefore have stomach unlike deer and moose which are primarily browser elk are similar to cattle in that they are primarily grazers but like other deer they also browse elk have a tendency to do most of their feeding in the morning and evening seeking sheltered area in between feeding to digest their diet vary somewhat depending on the season with native grass being a supplement tree bark being consumed in winter and forbs and tree sprout during the summer elk consume an average of kilogram lb of various vegetation daily particularly fond of aspen sprout which rise in the spring elk have had some impact on aspen grove which have been declining in some region where elk existrange and wildlife manager conduct survey of elk pellet group to monitor population and resource use parasite and disease at least specie of protist and animal parasite have been identified in elk most of these parasite seldom lead to significant mortality among wild or captive elk parelaphostrongylus tenuis brainworm or meningeal worm is a parasitic nematode known to affect the spinal cord and brain tissue of elk and other specie leading to death the definitive host is the deer in which it normally ha no ill effect snail and slug the intermediate host can be inadvertently consumed by elk during grazing the liver fluke fascioloides magna and the nematode dictyocaulus viviparus are also commonly found parasite that can be fatal to elk since infection by either of these parasite can be lethal to some commercial livestock specie their presence in elk herd is of some concern chronic wasting disease transmitted by a misfolded protein known a a prion affect the brain tissue in elk and ha been detected throughout their range in north america first documented in the late in mule deer the disease ha affected elk on game farm and in the wild in a number of region elk that have contracted the disease begin to show weight loss increased watering need disorientation and listlessness and at an advanced stage the disease lead to death the disease is similar to but not the same a mad cow disease and no risk to human have been documented nor ha the disease been demonstrated to pose a threat to domesticated cattle in south korea banned the importation of elk antler velvet due to concern about chronic wasting diseasethe bacterial disease brucellosis occasionally affect elk in the greater yellowstone ecosystem the only place in the u where the disease is still known to exist in domesticated cattle brucellosis cause infertility abortion and reduced milk production it is transmitted to human a undulant fever producing symptom that may last for year though bison are more likely to transmit the disease to other animal elk inadvertently transmitted brucellosis to horse in wyoming and cattle in idaho researcher are attempting to eradicate the disease through vaccination and measure which are expected to be successful nevertheless research ha been ongoing since and a successful vaccine ha yet to be developed a of recent necropsy study of captive elk in pennsylvania attributed the cause of death in of case to either gastrointestinal parasite case primarily eimeria sp and ostertagia sp or bacterial infection case mostly pneumonia elk hoof disease wa first noticed in the state of washington in the late in the cowlitz river basin with sporadic report of deformed hoof since then the disease ha spread rapidly with increased sighting throughout southwest washington and into oregon the disease is characterised by deformed broken or missing hoof and lead to severe lameness in elk the primary cause is not known but it is associated with treponeme bacteria which are known to cause digital dermatitis in commercial livestock the mode of transmission is also not known but it appears to be highly contagious among elk study are being undertaken by government department to determine how to halt or eliminate the disease ecology distribution modern subspecies are descended from elk that once inhabited beringia a steppe region between asia and north america that connected the two continent during the pleistocene beringia provided a migratory route for numerous mammal specie including brown bear camel horse caribou and moose a well a human a the pleistocene came to an end ocean level began to rise elk migrated southward into asia and north america in north america they adapted to almost all ecosystem except for tundra true desert and the gulf coast of the u the elk of southern siberia and central asia were once more widespread but today are restricted to the mountain range west of lake baikal including the sayan and altai mountain of mongolia and the tianshan region that border kyrgyzstan kazakhstan and china xinjiang province the habitat of siberian elk in asia is similar to that of the rocky mountain subspecies in north america during the late pleistocene their range wa much more extensive being distributed across eurasia with remains being found a far west a france these population are most closely related to modern asian population of the elk their range collapsed at the start of the holocene due to them being specialized to cold periglacial tundrasteppe habitat which wa largely replaced with closed forest being outcompeted by red deer in these condition relictual population survived into the early holocene in southern sweden and the alp where the environment remained favorablethroughout their range they live in forest and in forest edge habitat similar to other deer specie in mountainous region they often dwell at higher elevation in summer migrating down slope for winter the highly adaptable elk also inhabit in north america such a the great basin manchurian and alashan wapiti are primarily forest dweller and their smaller antler size is a likely adaptation to a forest environment introduction the rocky mountain elk subspecies ha been reintroduced by organization in the appalachian region of the eastern u where the now extinct eastern elk once lived after elk were reintroduced in the state of kentucky north carolina and tennessee they migrated into the neighboring state of virginia and west virginia and have established permanent population there in a male elk likely from the smoky mountain population wa sighted in south carolina for the first time in nearly year elk have also been reintroduced to a number of other state including pennsylvania michigan wisconsin missouri and etolin and afognak island in alaska reintroduction of the elk into ontario began in the early century and is ongoing with limited success a of population figure for the rocky mountain subspecies were and estimated number for all north american subspecies exceeded million prior to the european colonization of north america there were an estimated million elk on the continentoutside their native habitat elk and other deer specie especially deer were introduced in area that previously had few if any large native ungulate brought to these country for hunting and ranching for meat hide and antler velvet they have proven highly adaptable and have often had an adverse impact on local ecosystem elk and red deer were introduced to argentina in the early century there they are now considered an invasive specie encroaching on argentinian ecosystem where they compete for food with the indigenous chilean huemul and other herbivore this negative impact on native animal specie ha led the iucn to identify the elk a one of the world worst invadersthe introduction of deer to new zealand began in the middle of the century and current population are primarily european red deer with only percent being elk there is significant hybridization of elk with the more numerous red deer to the extent that pure elk may no longer exist in the wild in new zealand these deer have had an adverse impact on forest regeneration of some plant specie a they consume more palatable specie which are replaced with those that are le favored by the elk the impact will be an alteration of the type of plant and tree found and in other animal and plant specie dependent upon them a in chile and argentina the iucn ha declared that red deer and elk population in new zealand are an invasive specie cultural reference elk have played an important role in the cultural history of a number of people neolithic petroglyph from asia depict female elk which have been interpreted a symbolizing life and sustenance they were also frequently overlaid with boat and associated with river suggesting that they also represented path to the underworld petroglyph of elk were carved into cliff by the anasazi of the southwestern u hundred of year ago the elk wa of particular importance to the lakota and played a spiritual role in their society the male elk wa admired for it ability to attract mate and lakota men will play a courting flute imitating a bulging elk to attract woman men would like use elk antler a love charm and wore clothes decorated with elk imagesthe rocky mountain elk is the official state animal for utah an image of an elk and a moose appear on the state seal and flag of michigan the benevolent and protective order of elk bpoe chose the elk a it namesake because a number of it attribute seemed appropriate for cultivation by member of the fraternity a representation of the majestic head of the male with it spreading antler wa adopted a the first badge of the order and is still the most conspicuous element of it copyrighted fraternal emblem a prized possession of many member of the bpoe are jewel encrusted gold mounted elk teeth which are actually ivory commercial us although breakdown figure for each game specie are not available in the national survey from the u fish and wildlife service hunting of wild elk is most likely the primary economic impactwhile elk are not generally harvested for meat production on a large scale some restaurant offer the meat a a specialty item and it is also available in some grocery store the meat ha a taste somewhere between beef and venison and is higher in protein and lower in fat and cholesterol than beef pork and chicken elk meat is also a good source of iron phosphorus and zinca male elk can produce to kilogram to lb of antler velvet annually and on ranch in the united state canada and new zealand this velvet is collected and sold to market in east asia where it is used in medicine velvet is also considered by some culture to be an aphrodisiac however consuming velvet from elk in north america may be risky since velvet from animal infected with chronic wasting disease may contain prion that could result in a human getting variant diseaseantlers are also used in artwork furniture and other novelty item all asian subspecies along with other deer have been raised for their antler in central and eastern asia by han chinese turkic people tungusic people mongolian and korean elk farm are relatively common in north america and new zealandelk hide have been used for thousand of year for tepee covering blanket clothing and footwear modern us are more decorative but elk skin shoe glove and belt are not uncommonsince the boy scout of america have assisted employee at the national elk refuge in wyoming by collecting the antler which are shed each winter the antler are then auctioned with of the proceeds returned to the refuge in kilogram lb of antler were auctioned bringing in over see also alashan wapiti altai wapiti elk farming manchurian wapiti
