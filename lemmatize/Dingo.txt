the dingo canis familiaris canis familiaris dingo or canis lupus dingo is a dog found in australia it taxonomic classification is debated it is a canine that posse a lean hardy body adapted for speed agility and stamen the dingo three main coat colouration are light ginger or tan black and tan or creamy white the skull is and appears large in proportion to the bodythe earliest known dingo fossil found in western australia date to year ago which led to the presumption that dingo came to australia with seafarer prior to that time possibly from sulawesi in indonesia dingo morphology ha not changed over the past year this suggests that no artificial selection ha been applied over this periodthe dingo is closely related to the new guinea singing dog their lineage split early from the lineage that led to today domestic dog and can be traced back through the malay archipelago to asia a recent genetic study show that the lineage of those dingo found today in the northwestern part of the australian continent split from the lineage of the new guinea singing dog and southeastern dingo bc followed by a split between the new guinea singing dog lineage from the southeastern dingo lineage bc the study proposes that two dingo migration occurred when sea level were lower and australia and new guinea formed one landmass named sahul that existed until year agothe dingo habitat cover most of australia but they are absent in the southeast and tasmania and an area in the southwest see map dingo prey on mammal up to the size of the large red kangaroo in addition to bird reptile fish crab frog insect and seed the dingo competitor include the native quoll the introduced european red fox and the feral cat a dingo pack usually consists of a mated pair their offspring from the current year and sometimes offspring from the previous yearthe first british colonist who settled at port jackson in recorded dingo living with indigenous australian and later at melville island in and the lower darling and murray river in indicating that dingo were under some form of domestication by aboriginal australian when livestock farming began expanding across australia in the early century dingo began preying on sheep and cattle numerous measure have been implemented since then with only limited success the dingo is recognised a a native animal under the law of all australian jurisdiction the dingo play a prominent role in the dreamtime story of indigenous australian however it rarely appears depicted in their cave painting when compared with the extinct thylacine also known a the tasmanian tiger or tasmanian wolf etymology synonym and usage the name dingo come from the dharug language used by the indigenous australian of the sydney area the first british colonist to arrive in australia in established a settlement at port jackson and noted dingo living with indigenous australian the name wa first recorded in by watkin tench in his narrative of the expedition to botany bay the only domestic animal they have is the dog which in their language is called dingo and a good deal resembles the fox dog of england these animal are equally shy of u and attached to the native one of them is now in the possession of the governor and tolerably well reconciled to his new master the variant include for a bitch for a dog and for a big dog the dingo ha been given different name in the indigenous australian language including boolomo joogoong kal kurpany maliki mirigung noggum and wantibirri some author propose that a difference existed between camp dingo and wild dingo a they had different name among indigenous tribe the people of the yarralin northern territory region frequently call those dingo that live with them walaku and those that live in the wilderness ngurakin they also use the name walaku to refer to both dingo and dog the colonial settler of new south wale wrote using the name dingo only for camp dog it is proposed that in new south wale the camp dingo only became wild after the collapse of aboriginal society taxonomy dog associated with native were first recorded by jan carstenszoon in the cape york peninsula area in in captain william dampier visited the coast of what is now western australia and recorded that my men saw two or three beast like hungry wolf lean like so many skeleton being nothing but skin and bone in the first fleet arrived in botany bay under the command of australia first colonial governor arthur phillip who took ownership of a dingo and in his journal made a brief description with an illustration of the dog of new south wale in based on phillip brief description and illustration the dog of new south wale wa classified by friedrich meyer a canis dingoin a study of mitochondrial dna indicated that the domestic dog may have originated from multiple grey wolf population with the dingo and new guinea singing dog breed having developed at a time when human population were more isolated from each other in the third edition of mammal specie of the world published in the mammalogist w christopher wozencraft listed under the wolf canis lupus it wild subspecies and proposed two additional subspecies familiaris linneaus domestic dog and dingo meyer domestic dog wozencraft included hallstromi the new guinea singing dog a a taxonomic synonym for the dingo wozencraft referred to the mdna study a one of the guide in forming his decision the inclusion of familiaris and dingo under a domestic dog clade ha been noted by other mammalogist and their classification under the wolf debatedin a workshop hosted by the canid specialist group considered the new guinea singing dog and the dingo to be feral dog canis familiaris and therefore should not be assessed for the iucn red list domestic status the dingo is regarded a a feral dog because it descended from domesticated ancestor the dingo relationship with indigenous australian is one of commensalism in which two organism live in close association but do not depend on each other for survival they both hunt and sleep together the dingo is therefore comfortable enough around human to associate with them but is still capable of living independently any unowned dog can be socialised to become an owned dog a some dingo do when they join human family although the dingo exists in the wild it associate with human but ha not been selectively bred similarly to other domesticated animal therefore it status a a domestic animal is not clear whether the dingo wa a wild or domesticated specie wa not clarified from meyer original description which translated from the german language ambiguously read it is not known if it is the only dog specie in new south wale and if it can also still be found in the wild state however so far it appears to have lost little of it wild condition moreover no divergent variety have been discovered fossil record the oldest reliable date for dog remains found in mainland southeast asia is from vietnam at year ybp and in island southeast asia from at ybp the earliest dingo remains in the torres strait date to ybp in new guinea the earliest dog remains date to ybp from caution bay near port moresby but no ancient new guinea singing dog remains have been foundthe earliest dingo skeletal remains in australia are estimated at ybp from the mandura cave on the nullarbor plain western australia ybp from woombah midden near woombah new south wale and ybp from fromme landing on the murray river near mannum south australia dingo bone fragment were found in a rock shelter located at mount burr south australia in a layer that wa originally dated ybp excavation later indicated that the level had been disturbed and the dingo remains probably moved to an earlier level the dating of these early australian dingo fossil led to the widely held belief that dingo first arrived in australia ybp and then took year to disperse around the continent however the timing of these skeletal remains wa based on the dating of the sediment in which they were discovered and not the specimen themselvesin the oldest skeletal bone from the madura cave were directly carbon dated between and ybp providing firm evidence of the earliest dingo and that dingo arrived later than had previously been proposed the reliable timing is based on desiccated flesh dated ybp from thylacine hole km west of eucla on the nullarbor plain southeastern western australia when dingo first arrived they would have been taken up by indigenous australian who then provided a network for their swift transfer around the continent based on the recorded distribution time for dog across tasmania and cat across australia once indigenous australian had acquired them the dispersal of dingo from their point of landing until they occupied continental australia is proposed to have taken only year the red fox is estimated to have dispersed across the continent in only yearsat the end of the last glacial maximum and the associated rise in sea level tasmania became separated from the australian mainland ybp and new guinea ybp by the inundation of the sahul shelf fossil remains in australia date to around ybp and no dingo remains have been uncovered in tasmania so the dingo is estimated to have arrived in australia at a time between and ybp to reach australia through the malay archipelago even at the lowest sea level of the last glacial maximum a journey of at least km over open sea between ancient sunda and sahul wa necessary so they must have accompanied human on boatsbased on a comparison with these early fossil dingo morphology ha not changed over thousand of year this suggests that no artificial selection ha been applied over this period and that the dingo represents an early form of dog they have lived bred and undergone natural selection in the wild isolated from other canine until the arrival of european settler resulting in a unique canid phylogeny whole genome sequencing indicates that dog are a genetically divergent subspecies of the grey wolf the dog is not a descendant of the extant grey wolf but these are sister taxon which share a common ancestor from a ghost population of wolf that disappeared at the end of the late pleistocene the dog and the dingo are not separate specie the dingo and the basenji are basal member of the domestic dog clade the term basal taxon refers to a lineage that diverges early in the history of the group and lie on a branch that originates near the common ancestor of the group mitochondrial genome sequence indicates that the dingo fall within the domestic dog clade and that the new guinea singing dog is genetically closer to those dingo that live in southeastern australia than to those that live in the northwest the dingo and new guinea singing dog lineage can be traced back through the malay archipelago to asia gene flow from the genetically divergent tibetan wolf form of the dingo genome which likely represents ancient admixture in eastern eurasia description body the dingo is a canid with a lean hardy body that is designed for speed agility and stamen the head is the widest part of the body and large in proportion to the body captive dingo are longer and heavier than wild dingo a they have access to better food and veterinary care the average wild dingo male weighs kg lb and the female kg lb compared with the captive male kg lb and the female kg lb the average wild dingo male length is cm in and the female cm in compared with the captive male cm in and the female cm in the average wild dingo male stand at the shoulder height of cm in and the female cm in compared with the captive male cm in and the female cm in dingo rarely carry excess fat and the wild one display exposed rib dingo from northern and northwestern australia are often larger than those found in central and southern australia the dingo is similar to the new guinea singing dog in morphology apart from the dingo greater height at the withers head early study identified the skull a being more like that of the golden jackal than it is to the wolf or coyote one study proposes that compared with the skull of the dog the dingo posse a longer muzzle longer carnassial teeth longer and more slender canine teeth larger auditory bulla a flatter cranium with a larger sagittal crest and larger nuchal line in a study wa conducted on century dingo specimen that are unlikely to have been influenced by later hybridisation the dingo skull wa found to differ relative to the domestic dog by it larger palatal width longer rostrum shorter skull height and wider sagittal crest however this wa rebutted with the figure falling within the wider range of the domestic dog and that each dog breed differs from the others in skull measurement based on a comparison with the remains of a dingo found at fromme landing the dingo skull and skeleton have not changed over the past year compared to the wolf the dingo posse a paedomorphic cranium similar to domestic dog however the dingo ha a larger brain size compared to dog of the same body weight with the dingo being more comparable with the wolf than dog are in this respect the dingo resembles two similar mesopredators the dhole and the coyote the eye are triangular or and are hazel to dark in colour with dark rim the ear are erect and occur high on the skull coat colour the dingo three main coat colour are described a being light ginger or tan black and tan and creamy white the ginger colour range from a deep rust to a pale cream and can be found in of dingo often small white marking are seen on the tip of the tail the foot and the chest but with no large white patch some do not exhibit white tip the black and tan dingo posse a black coat with a tan muzzle chest belly leg and foot and can be found in of dingo solid white can be found in of dingo and solid black coat colour with sable ticking or brindle indicate some hybridisation and can be found in of dingo only three gene affect coat colour in the dingo compared with nine gene in the domestic dog the ginger colour is dominant and carry the other three main colour black tan and white white dingo breed true and black and tan dingo breed true when these cross the result is a sandy colour the coat is not oily nor ha have a odour the dingo ha a single coat in the tropical north of australia and a double thick coat in the cold mountain of the south the undercoat being a colour tail the dingo tail is flatish tapering after and doe not curve over the back but is carried low gait when walking the dingo rear foot step in line with the front foot and these do not posse dewclaws lifespan dingo in the wild live year with few living past year some have been recorded living up to year in captivity they live for year one dingo ha been recorded to live just under year adaptation hybrid distribution and habitat the canid are a group of large carnivore that are genetically closely related because their chromosome number therefore they can potentially interbreed to produce fertile hybrid in the australian wild there exist dingo feral dog and the crossing of these two which produce hybrid most study looking at the distribution of dingo focus on the distribution of hybrid insteaddingoes occurred throughout mainland australia before european settlement they are not found in the fossil record of tasmania so they apparently arrived in australia after tasmania had separated from the mainland due to rising sea level the introduction of agriculture reduced dingo distribution and by the early large barrier fence including the dingo fence excluded them from the area land clearance poisoning and trapping caused the extinction of the dingo and hybrid from most of their former range in southern queensland new south wale victoria and south australia today they are absent from most of new south wale victoria the southeastern third of south australia and the southwestern tip of western australia they are sparse in the eastern half of western australia and the adjoining area of the northern territory and south australia they are regarded a common across the remainder of the continentthe dingo could be considered an ecotype or an ecospecies that ha adapted to australia unique environment the dingo present distribution cover a variety of habitat including the temperate region of eastern australia the alpine moorland of the eastern highland the arid hot desert of central australia and the tropical forest and wetland of northern australia the occupation of and adaption to these habitat may have been assisted by their relationship with indigenous australian prey a study of the dingo diet wa conducted across australia by the federal and state government these examined a total of stomach content and fecal sample for the fecal sample determining the matching track of fox and feral cat wa possible without including these sample in the study but in distinguishing between the track left by dingo and those of dingo hybrid or feral dog wa impossible the study found that these canine prey on specie represented by mammal specie bird specie vegetation seed reptile specie and insect fish crab and frog specie the relative proportion of prey are much the same across australia apart from more bird being eaten in the north and coastal region and more lizard in central australia some of the diet consisted of specie red kangaroo swamp wallaby cattle dusky rat magpie goose common brushtail possum rat agile wallaby european rabbit and common wombat of the mammal eaten could be regarded a largehowever the relative proportion of the size of prey mammal varied across region in the tropical coast region of the northern territory agile wallaby dusky rat and magpie goose formed of the diet in central australia the rabbit ha become a substitute for native mammal and during drought cattle carcass provide most of the diet on the barkly tableland no rabbit occur nor doe any native specie dominate the diet except for rat that form occasional plague in the fortescue river region the large red kangaroo and common wallaroo dominate the diet a few smaller mammal are found in this area on the nullarbor plain rabbit and red kangaroo dominate the diet and twice a much rabbit eaten a red kangaroo in the temperate mountain of eastern australia swamp wallaby and wallaby dominate the diet on the lower slope and wombat on the higher slope possum are commonly eaten here when found on the ground in coastal region dingo patrol the beach for fish seal penguin and other birdsdingoes drink about a litre of water each day in the summer and half a litre in winter in arid region during the winter dingo may live from the liquid in the body of their prey a long a the number of prey is sufficient in arid central australia weaned pup draw most of their water from their food there regurgitation of water by the female for the pup wa observed during lactation captive female have no higher need of water than usual since they consume the urine and feces of the pup thus recycling the water and keeping the den clean tracked dingo in the strzelecki desert regularly visited every day with two dingo surviving day without water during both winter and summer hunting behaviour dingo dingo hybrid and feral dog usually attack from the rear a they pursue their prey they kill their prey by biting the throat which damage the trachea and the major blood vessel of the neck the size of the hunting pack is determined by the type of prey targeted with large pack formed to help hunt large prey large prey can include kangaroo cattle water buffalo and feral horse dingo will ass and target prey based on the prey ability to inflict damage on dingo large kangaroo are the most commonly killed prey the main tactic is to sight the kangaroo bail it up then kill it dingo typically hunt large kangaroo by having lead dingo chase the quarry toward the path of their pack mate which are skilled at cutting corner in chase the kangaroo becomes exhausted and is then killed this same tactic is used by wolf african wild dog and hyena another tactic shared with african wild dog is a relay pursuit until the prey is exhausted a pack of dingo is three time a likely to bring down a kangaroo than an individual because the killing is done by those following the lead chaser which ha also become exhausted two pattern are seen for the final stage of the attack an adult or juvenile kangaroo is nipped at the hamstring of the hind leg to slow it before an attack to the throat a small adult female or juvenile is bitten on the neck or back by dingo running beside it in one area of central australia dingo hunt kangaroo by chasing them into a wire fence where they become temporarily immobilised the largest male red kangaroo tend to ignore dingo even when the dingo are hunting the younger male and female a large eastern grey kangaroo successfully fought off an attack by a single dingo that lasted over an hour wallaby are hunted in a similar manner to kangaroo the difference being that a single dingo hunt using scent rather than sight and the hunt may last several hoursdingo pack may attack young cattle and buffalo but never healthy grown adult they focus on the sick or injured young the tactic include harassing a mother with young panicking a herd to separate the adult from the young or watching a herd and looking for any unusual behaviour that might then be exploited one study in the fortescue river region observed that cattle defend their calf by circling around the calf or aggressively charging dingo in one study of approach were by more than one dingo and only four resulted in calf being killed dingo often revisited carcass they did not touch fresh cattle carcass until these were largely skin and bone and even when these were plentiful they still preferred to hunt kangaroo of chase of sheep sheep were seriously injured but only eight were killed the dingo could outrun the sheep and the sheep were defenceless however the dingo in general appeared not to be motivated to kill sheep and in many case just loped alongside the sheep before veering off to chase another sheep for those that did kill and consume sheep a large quantity of kangaroo wa still in their diet indicating once again a preference for kangaroolone dingo can run down a rabbit but are more successful by targeting kitten near rabbit warren dingo take nestling bird in addition to bird that are moulting and therefore can not fly predator often use highly intelligent hunting technique dingo on fraser island have been observed using wave to entrap tire and help drown an adult swamp wallaby and an echidna in the coastal wetland of northern australia dingo depend on magpie goose for a large part of their diet and a lone dingo sometimes distracts these while a sea eagle make a kill that is too heavy for it to carry off with the dingo then driving the sea eagle away they also scavenge on prey dropped from the nesting platform of sea eagle lone dingo may hunt small rodent and grasshopper in grass by using their sens of smell and hearing then pouncing on them with their forepaw competitor dingo and their hybrid with the native quoll they also in the same territory a the introduced european red fox and feral cat but little is known about the relationship between these three dingo and their hybrid can drive off fox from source of water and occasionally eat feral cat dingo can be killed by buffalo and cattle goring and kicking them from snake bite and predation on their pup by eagle communication like all domestic dog dingo tend towards phonetic communication however in contrast to domestic dog dingo howl and whimper more and bark le eight sound class with sound type have been identified barking compared to most domestic dog the bark of a dingo is short and monosyllabic and is rarely used barking wa observed to make up only of vocalisation dog barking ha always been distinct from wolf barking australian dingo bark mainly in swooshing noise or in a mixture of atonal and tonal sound in addition barking is almost exclusively used for giving warning in a homotypical sequence and a kind of in a heterotypical sequence have also been observed the start with several bark and then fade into a rising and ebbing howl and is probably similar to coughing used to warn the puppy and member of the pack additionally dingo emit a sort of wailing sound which they mostly use when approaching a watering hole probably to warn already present dingoesaccording to the present state of knowledge getting australian dingo to bark more frequently by putting them in contact with other domestic dog is not possible however german zoologist alfred brehm reported a dingo that learned the more typical form of barking and how to use it while it brother did not whether dingo bark or le frequently in general is not certain howling dingo have three basic form of howling moan and snuff with at least variation usually three kind of howl are distinguished long and persistent rising and ebbing and short and abrupt observation have shown that each kind of howling ha several variation though their purpose is unknown the frequency of howling varies with the season and time of day and is also influenced by breeding migration lactation social stability and dispersal behaviour howling can be more frequent in time of food shortage because the dog become more widely distributed within their home rangeadditionally howling seems to have a group function and is sometimes an expression of joy for example overall howling wa observed le frequently in dingo than among grey wolf it may happen that one dog will begin to howl and several or all other dog will howl back and bark from time to time in the wilderness dingo howl over long distance to attract other member of the pack to find other dog or to keep intruder at bay dingo howl in chorus with significant pitch and with increasing number of pack member the variability of pitch also increase therefore dingo are suspected to be able to measure the size of a pack without visual contact moreover their highly variable chorus howl have been proposed to generate a confounding effect in the receiver by making pack size appear larger other form growling making up about of the vocalisation is used in an agonistic context for dominance and a a defensive sound similar to many domestic dog a reactive usage of defensive growling is only rarely observed growling very often occurs in combination with other sound and ha been observed almost exclusively in swooshing noise similar to barking during observation in germany dingo were heard to produce a sound that observer have called schrappen it wa only observed in an agonistic context mostly a a defence against obtrusive pup or for defending resource it wa described a a bite intention during which the receiver is never touched or hurt only a clashing of the teeth could be heardaside from vocal communication dingo communicate like all domestic dog via scent marking specific object for example spinifex or place such a water trail and hunting ground using chemical signal from their urine feces and scent gland male scent mark more frequently than female especially during the mating season they also scent rub whereby a dog roll it neck shoulder or back on something that is usually associated with food or the scent marking of other dogsunlike wolf dingo can react to social cue and gesture from human behaviour dingo tend to be nocturnal in warmer region but le so in cooler area their main period of activity is around dusk and dawn the period of activity are short often le than hour with short time of resting dingo have two kind of movement a searching movement apparently associated with hunting and an exploratory movement probably for contact and communication with other dog according to study in queensland the wild dog dingo hybrid there move freely at night through urban area and cross street and seem to get along quite well social behaviour the dingo social behaviour is about a flexible a that of a coyote or grey wolf which is perhaps one of the reason the dingo wa originally believed to have descended from the indian wolf while young male are often solitary and nomadic in nature breeding adult often form a settled pack however in area of the dingo habitat with a widely spaced population breeding pair remain together apart from others dingo distribution are a single dingo two dingo three dingo four dingo and pack of five to seven dingo a dingo pack usually consists of a mated pair their offspring from the current year and sometimes offspring from the previous yearwhere condition are favourable among dingo pack the pack is stable with a distinct territory and little overlap between neighbour the size of pack often appears to correspond to the size of prey available in the pack territory desert area have smaller group of dingo with a more loose territorial behaviour and sharing of the water site the average monthly pack size wa noted to be between three and memberssimilar to other canid a dingo pack largely consists of a mated pair their current year offspring and occasionally a previous year offspring dominance hierarchy exist both between and within male and female with male usually being more dominant than female however a few exception have been noted in captive pack during travel while eating prey or when approaching a water source for the first time the breeding male will be seen a the leader or alpha subordinate dingo approach a more dominant dog in a slightly crouched posture ear flat and tail down to ensure peace in the pack establishment of artificial pack in captive dingo ha failed reproduction dingo breed once annually depending on the estrous cycle of the female which according to most source only come in heat once per year dingo female can come in heat twice per year but can only be pregnant once a year with the second time only seeming to be pregnantmales are virile throughout the year in most region but have a lower sperm production during the summer in most case during study on dingo from the eastern highland and central australia in captivity no specific breeding cycle could be observed all were potent throughout the year the breeding wa only regulated by the heat of the female a rise in testosterone wa observed in the male during the breeding season but this wa attributed to the heat of the female and copulation in contrast to the captive dingo captured dingo male from central australia did show evidence of a male breeding cycle those dingo showed no interest in female in heat this time other domestic dog outside of the mating season january to july and did not breed with themthe mating season usually occurs in australia between march and may according to other source between april and june during this time dingo may actively defend their territory using vocalisation dominance behaviour growling and barkingmost female in the wild start breeding at the age of year within pack the alpha female tends to go into heat before subordinate and actively suppresses mating attempt by other female male become sexually mature between the age of and year the precise start of breeding varies depending on age social status geographic range and seasonal condition among dingo in captivity the wa observed to last day however the may last a long a day in the wild in general the only dingo in a pack that successfully breed are the alpha pair and the other pack member help with raising the pup subordinate are actively prevented from breeding by the alpha pair and some subordinate female have a false pregnancy or solitary dingo can successfully breed if the pack structure break upthe gestation period last for day and the size of the litter can range from one to usually five pup with the number of male born tending to be higher than that of female pup of subordinate female usually get killed by the alpha female which cause the population increase to be low even in good time this behaviour possibly developed a an adaptation to the fluctuating environmental condition in australia pup are usually born between may and august the winter period but in tropical region breeding can occur at any time of the yearat the age of week the pup leave the den for the first time and leave it completely at week in australia den are mostly underground report exist of den in abandoned rabbit burrow rock formation under boulder in dry creek under large spinifex in hollow log and augmented burrow of monitor lizard and wombat burrow the pup usually stray around the den within a radius of km mi and are accompanied by older dog during longer travel the transition to consuming solid food is normally accompanied by all member of the pack during the age of to week apart from their own experience pup also learn through observation young dingo usually become independent at the age of month or they disperse at the age of month when the next mating season start migration dingo usually remain in one area and do not undergo seasonal migration however during time of famine even in normally safe area dingo travel into pastoral area where intensive control measure are undertaken in western australia in the young dog were found to travel for long distance when necessary about of the dog younger than later recaptured far away from their first location among these of the travelled distance for male wa km mi and for female km mi therefore travelling dingo had lower chance of survival in foreign territory and they are apparently unlikely to survive long migration through occupied territory the rarity of long migration route seemed to confirm this during investigation in the nullarbor plain even longer migration route were recorded the longest recorded migration route of a dingo wa about km mi attack on human dingo generally avoid conflict with human but they are large enough to be dangerous most attack involve people feeding wild dingo particularly on fraser island which is a special centre of tourism the vast majority of dingo attack are minor in nature but some can be major and a few have been fatal the death of azaria chamberlain in the northern territory in is one of them many australian national park have sign advising visitor not to feed wildlife partly because this practice is not healthy for the animal and partly because it may encourage undesirable behaviour such a snatching or biting by dingo kangaroo goannas and some bird impact ecological extinction of thylacine some researcher propose that the dingo caused the extinction of the thylacine the tasmanian devil and the tasmanian native hen from mainland australia because of the correlation in space and time with the dingo arrival recent study have questioned this proposal suggesting that climate change and increasing human population may have been the cause dingo do not seem to have had the same ecological impact that the red fox had in later time this might be connected to the dingo way of hunting and the size of their favoured prey a well a to the low number of dingo in the time before european colonisationthe assumption that dingo and thylacine were competitor for the same prey stem from their external similarity the thylacine had a stronger and more efficient bite but wa probably dependent on relatively small prey while the dingo stronger skull and neck would have allowed it to bring down larger prey the dingo wa probably a superior hunter a it hunted cooperatively in pack and could better defend resource while the thylacine wa probably more solitary also wild dingo population might have had demographic support from conspecific living with human the extinction of the thylacine on the continent around year ago ha also been linked to change in climate and land use by the aborigine naming the dingo a the cause of the extinction is plausible but significant morphological difference between the two suggest that the ecological overlapping of both specie might be exaggerated the dingo ha the dentition of a generalist while the thylacine had the dentition of a specialist carnivore without any sign of consumption of carrion or bone this theory doe not explain how the tasmanian devil and the dingo coexisted on the same continent until about year ago when the dingo supposedly caused the tasmanian devil demise the group dynamic of dingo should have successfully kept devil away from carrion and since dingo are able to break bone little would have been left for the devil to scavenge additionally devil are successful hunter of to prey so overlapping of the specie should have occurred in this area too furthermore the argument that the dingo caused the extinction of the thylacine the devil and the hen are in direct conflict with each other if the dingo were really so similar to the thylacine and the tasmanian devil in it ecological role and suppressed both then coexisting with both for such an extended time is strange although this is a possible result of the dingo introduction critic regard the evidence for this a insubstantialin a genetic study found that the population of the northwestern dingo had commenced expanding since year ago this wa proposed to be due either to their first arrival in australia or to the commencement of the extinction of the thylacine with the dingo expanding into the thylacine former range interaction with human in the australian native dog training society of nsw ltd wa founded but ha now ceased in the australian national kennel council recognised a dingo breed standard within it hound group the dingo is not recognised a a dog breed by the federation cynologique internationale dingo can be very tame when they come in frequent contact with human furthermore some dingo live with human due to practical a well a emotional reason many indigenous australian and early european settler lived alongside dingo indigenous australian would take dingo pup from the den and tame them until sexual maturity and the dog would leave alfred brehm reported case where dingo were completely tame and in some case behaved exactly like other domestic dog one wa used for shepherding heavy livestock a well a specimen that remained wild and shy he also reported about dingo that were aggressive and completely uncontrollable but he wa of the opinion that these report should not get more attention than they deserve since the behaviour depends on how the dingo wa raised since early puppyhood he believed that these dog could become very decent petsthe ownership of dingo a pet and their breeding is widely criticised the main criticism is that the activity and the resulting consequence of the dingo conservation group dingo farm and legislation for legal ownership of dingo for people in public is seen to be an additional threat to the survival of the pure dingo this fear exists because the majority of these breeding activity effectively expedite the interbreeding of dingo and other domestic dog when the identification of a pure dingo is not absolutely correct respectively when hybrid are sold a pure dingoessupporters of breeding programme are only mildly optimistic about a successful outcome success in the form of a population viable for future can not be easily accomplished according to david jenkins the breeding and reintroduction of pure dingo is no easy option and at the time there were no study that seriously dealt with this topic especially in area where dingo population are already presentan additional threat is that breeder may unconsciously select tamer dingo by breeding individual who are easier to manage therefore it may happen that over the year the tame population may become le suitable for living in the wild than their ancestor in addition a loss of genetic diversity thus resulting in a higher susceptibility to disease might occur due to a small founding population and negative change could occur simply because the dog were furthermore some feature that are necessary for survival in the wild such a hunting technique might fade under the condition of domestication because they are no longer needed pet dingo are likely to escape interaction with other animal the dingo is regarded a part of the native australian fauna by many environmentalist and biologist a these dog existed on the continent before the arrival of the european and a mutual adaptation of the dingo and their surrounding ecosystem had occurred much of the present place of wild dog in the australian ecosystem especially in the urban area remains unknown although the ecological role of dingo in northern and central australia is well understood the same doe not apply to the role of wild dog in the east of the continent in contrast to some claim dingo are assumed to have a positive impact on biodiversity in area where feral fox are presentdingoes are regarded a apex predator and possibly perform an ecological key function likely with increasing evidence from scientific research they control the diversity of the ecosystem by limiting the number of prey and keeping the competition in check wild dog hunt feral livestock such a goat and pig a well a native prey and introduced animal the low number of feral goat in northern australia is possibly caused by the presence of the dingo but whether they control the goat number or not is still disputable study from in the northern wet forest of australia found the dingo there did not reduce the number of feral pig but their predation only affect the pig population together with the presence of water buffalo which hinder the pig access to food observation concerning the mutual impact of dingo and red fox and cat population suggest dingo limit the access of fox and cat to certain resource a a result a disappearance of the dingo may cause an increase of red fox and feral cat number and therefore a higher pressure on native animal these study found the presence of dingo is one of the factor that keep fox number in an area low and therefore reduces pressure on native animal which then do not disappear from the area the countrywide number of red fox are especially high where dingo number are low but other factor might responsible for this depending on the area evidence wa found for a competition between wild dog and red fox in the blue mountain of new south wale since many overlap occurred in the spectrum of preferred prey but only evidence for local competition not on a grand scale wa foundalso dingo can live with red fox and feral cat without reducing their number in area with sufficient food resource for example high rabbit number and hiding place nearly nothing is known about the relationship of wild dog and feral cat except both mostly live in the same area although wild dog also eat cat whether this affect the cat population is not knownadditionally the disappearance of dingo might increase the prevalence of kangaroo rabbit and australian brushturkey number in the area outside the dingo fence the number of dingo and emu is lower than in the area inside however the number changed depending on the habitat since the environment is the same on both side of the fence the dingo wa assumed to be a strong factor for the regulation of these specie therefore some people demand that dingo number should be allowed to increase or dingo should be reintroduced in area with low dingo population to lower the pressure on endangered population of native specie and to reintroduce them in certain area in addition the presence of the australian brushturkey in queensland increased significantly after dingo baiting wa conducted cultural cultural opinion about the dingo are often based on it perceived cunning and the idea that it is an intermediate between civilisation and wildnesssome of the early european settler looked on dingo a domestic dog while others thought they were more like wolf over the year dingo began to attack sheep and their relationship to the european changed very quickly they were regarded a devious and cowardly since they did not fight bravely in the eye of the european and vanished into the bush additionally they were seen a promiscuous or a devil with a venomous bite or saliva so they could be killed unreservedly over the year dingo trapper gained some prestige for their work especially when they managed to kill dingo dingo were associated with thief vagabond bushrangers and parliamentary opponent from the politician began calling their opponent dingo meaning they were cowardly and treacherous and it ha become a popular form of attack since then today the word dingo still stand for coward and cheat with verb and adjective form used a wellthe image of the dingo ha ranged among some group from the instructive to the demonicceremonies like a keen at the cape york peninsula in the form of howling and dreamtime story are connected to the dingo which were passed down through the generation the dingo play a prominent role in the dreamtime story of indigenous australian but it is rarely depicted in their cave painting when compared with the extinct thylacine one of the tribal elder of the people of the yarralin northern territory region tell that the dreamtime dingo is the ancestor of both dingo and human the dingo are what we would be if we were not what we are similar to how european acquired dingo the aboriginal people of australia acquired dog from the immigrant very quickly this process wa so fast that francis barrallier surveyor on early expedition around the colony at port jackson discovered in that five dog of european origin were there before him one theory hold that other domestic dog adopt the role of the pure dingo introduced animal such a the water buffalo and the domestic cat have been adopted into the indigenous aboriginal culture in the form of ritual traditional painting and dreamtime storiesmost of the published myth originate from the western desert and show a remarkable complexity in some story dingo are the central character while in others they are only minor one one time an ancestor from the dreamtime created human and dingo or gave them their current shape story mention creation socially acceptable behaviour and explanation why some thing are the way they are myth exist about shapeshifters human to dingo or vice versa and the creation of certain landscape or element of those landscape like waterholes or mountain economic livestock farming commenced expanding across australia from the early which led to conflict between the dingo and grazier sheep and to a lesser extent cattle are an easy target for dingo the pastoralists and the government body that support this industry have shot trapped and poisoned dingo or destroyed dingo pup in their den after two century of persecution the dingo or hybrid can still be found across most of the continentresearch on the real extent of the damage and the reason for this problem only started recently livestock can die from many cause and when the carcass is found determining with certainty the cause of death is often difficult since the outcome of an attack on livestock depends to a high degree on the behaviour and experience of the predator and the prey only direct observation is certain to determine whether an attack wa by dingo or other domestic dog even the existence of remnant of the prey in the scat of wild dog doe not prove they are pest since wild dog also eat carrion the cattle industry can tolerate low to moderate and sometimes high grade of wild dog therefore dingo are not so easily regarded a pest in these area in the case of sheep and goat a attitude is common the biggest threat are dog that live inside or near the paddock area the extent of sheep loss is hard to determine due to the wide pasture land in some part of australia in cattle loss in the northern territory rangeland grazing area were estimated to be up to therefore factor such a availability of native prey a well a the defending behaviour and health of the cattle play an important role in the number of loss a study in central australia in confirmed that dingo only have a low impact on cattle number when a sufficient supply of other prey such a kangaroo and rabbit is available in some part of australia the loss of calf is assumed to be minimised if horned cattle are used instead of polled the precise economic impact is not known in this case and the rescue of some calf is unlikely to compensate for the necessary cost of control measure calf usually suffer le lethal wound than sheep due to their size and the protection by the adult cattle so have a higher chance of surviving an attack a a result the evidence of a dog attack may only be discovered after the cattle have been herded back into the enclosure and sign such a bitten ear tail and other wound are discovered the opinion of cattle owner regarding dingo are more variable than those of sheep owner some cattle owner believe that the weakened mother losing her calf is better in time of drought so that she doe not have to care for her calf too therefore these owner are more hesitant to kill dingo the cattle industry may benefit from the predation of dingo on rabbit kangaroo and rat furthermore the mortality rate of calf ha many possible cause and discriminating between them is difficult the only reliable method to document the damage would be to document all pregnant cow then observe their development and those of their calf the loss of calf in observed area where dingo were controlled wa higher than in other area loss of livestock is therefore not necessarily caused by the occurrence of dingo and is independent from wild dog one researcher ha stated that for cattle station where dingo were controlled kangaroo were abundant and this affect the availability of grassdomestic dog are the only terrestrial predator in australia that are big enough to kill fully grown sheep and only a few sheep manage to recover from the severe injury in the case of lamb death can have many cause apart from attack by predator which are blamed for the death because they eat from the carcass although attack by red fox are possible such attack are more rare than previously thought the fact that the sheep and goat industry is much more susceptible to damage caused by wild dog than the cattle industry is mostly due to two factor the flight behaviour of the sheep and their tendency to flock together in the face of danger and the hunting method of wild dog along with their efficient way of handling goat and sheep therefore the damage to the livestock industry doe not correlate to the number of wild dog in an area except that no damage occurs where no wild dog occur according to a report from the government of queensland wild dog cost the state about million annually due to livestock loss the spread of disease and control measure loss for the livestock industry alone were estimated to be a high a million in barcaldine queensland up to of all sheep are killed by dingo annually a situation which ha been described a an epidemic according to a survey among cattle owner in performed by the park and wildlife service owner estimated their annual loss due to wild dog depending on the district to be from to in a study in northern south australia indicates that loss average with no significant reduction due to dingo baiting the calf loss did not correlate with increased dingo activity and the cattle disease pestivirus and leptospirosis were a major cause dingo then scavenged on the carcass there wa also evidence of dingo predation on calvesamong the indigenous australian dingo were also used a hunting aid living hot water bottle and camp dog their scalp were used a a kind of currency their teeth were traditionally used for decorative purpose and their fur for traditional costume sometimes pure dingo are important for tourism when they are used to attract visitor however this seems to be common only on fraser island where the dingo are extensively used a a symbol to enhance the attraction of the island tourist are drawn to the experience of personally interacting with dingo picture of dingo appear on brochure many website and postcard advertising the island legal status the dingo is recognised a a native animal under the law of all australian jurisdiction australia ha over national park of which all but six are managed by the state and territory a of the legal status of the dingo varies between these jurisdiction and in some instance it varies between different region of a single jurisdiction australian government the environment protection and biodiversity conservation act under section defines a native specie a one that wa present in australia before the year the dingo is protected in all australian government managed national park and reserve world heritage area and other protected area australian capital territory the dingo is listed a a pest animal in the pest plant and animal pest animal declaration no made under the pest plant and animal act which call for a management plan for pest animal the nature conservation act protects native animal in national park and reserve but excludes this protection to pest animal declared under the pest plant and animal act new south wale the dingo fall under the definition of wildlife under the national park and wildlife act however it also becomes unprotected fauna under schedule of the act the wild dog destruction act applies only to the western division of the state and includes the dingo in it definition of wild dog the act requires landowner to destroy any wild dog on their property and any person owning a dingo or dingo without a permit face a fine in other part of the state dingo can be kept a pet under the companion animal act a a dingo is defined under this act a a dog the dingo ha been proposed for listing under the threatened specie conservation act because it is argued that these dog had established population before the arrival of european but no decision ha been made northern territory the dingo is a vertebrate that is indigenous to australia and therefore protected wildlife under the territory park and wildlife conservation act a permit is required for all matter dealing with protected wildlife queensland the dingo is listed a least concern wildlife in the nature conservation wildlife regulation under the nature conservation act therefore the dingo is protected in national park and conservation area the dingo is listed a a pest in the land protection pest and stock route management regulation under the land protection pest and stock route management act which requires land owner to take reasonable step to keep their land free of pest south australia the national park and wildlife act defines a protected animal a one that is indigenous to australia but then list the dingo a an unprotected specie under schedule the purpose of the dog fence act is to prevent wild dog entering into the pastoral and agricultural area south of the fence the dingo is listed a a wild dog under this act and landowner are required to maintain the fence and destroy any wild dog within the vicinity of the fence by shooting trapping or baiting the dingo is listed a an unprotected specie in the natural resource management act which allows landowner to lay bait to control animal on their land just north of the dog fence tasmania tasmania doe not have a native dingo population the dingo is listed a a restricted animal in the nature conservation act and can not be imported without a permit once imported into tasmania a dingo is listed a a dog under the dog control act victoria the dingo is a vertebrate taxon that is indigenous to australia and therefore wildlife under the wildlife act which protects wildlife the act mandate that a permit is required to keep a dingo and that this dingo must not be with a dog the act allows an order to be made to unprotect dingo in certain area of the state the order in council made on the september includes the far of the state and all of the state of melbourne it wa made to protect stock on private land the order allows dingo to be trapped shot or baited by any person on private land in these region while protecting the dingo on land western australia dingo are considered a unprotected native fauna under the western australian wildlife conservation act the dingo is recorded a a declared pest on the western australian organism list this list record those specie that have been declared a pest under the biosecurity and agriculture management act and these are regarded a pest across all of western australia landowner must take the prescribed measure to deal with declared pest on their land the policy of the wa government is to promote eradication of dingo in the livestock grazing area but leave them undisturbed in the rest of the state control measure dingo attack on livestock led to widescale effort to repel them from area with intensive agricultural usage and all state and territory have enacted law for the control of dingo in the early century fence were erected to keep dingo away from area frequented by sheep and a tendency to routinely eradicate dingo developed among some livestock owner established method for the control of dingo in sheep area entailed the employment of specific worker on every property the job of these people who were nicknamed doggers wa to reduce the number of dingo by using steel trap bait firearm and other method the responsibility for the control of wild dog lay solely in the hand of the landowner at the same time the government wa forced to control the number of dingo a a result a number of measure for the control of dingo developed over time it wa also considered that dingo travel over long distance to reach area with richer prey population and the control method were often concentrated along path or trail and in area that were far away from sheep area all dingo were regarded a a potential danger and were hunted apart from the introduction of the poison extensively used for year and nicknamed doggone the method and strategy for controlling wild dog have changed little over time information concerning cultural importance to indigenous people and the importance of dingo and the impact of control measure on other specie is also lacking in some area historically the attitude and need of indigenous people were not taken into account when dingo were controlled other factor that might be taken into account are the genetic status degree of interbreeding of dingo in these area ownership and land usage a well a a reduction of killing measure to area outside of the zone however most control measure and the appropriate study are there to minimise the loss of livestock and not to protect dingo increasing pressure from environmentalist against the random killing of dingo a well a the impact on other animal demanded that more information needed to be gathered to prove the necessity of control measure and to disprove the claim of unnecessary killing today permanent population control is regarded a necessary to reduce the impact of all wild dog and to ensure the survival of the pure dingo in the wild guardian animal to protect livestock livestock guardian dog for example maremmas donkey alpaca and llama are used dingo fence in the the dingo fence wa erected on the basis of the wild dog act and until thousand of mile of dingo fence had been erected in several area of south australia in the year these effort were directed to a single goal and the dingo fence wa finally completed the fence connected with other fence in new south wale and queensland the main responsibility in maintaining the dingo fence still lie with the landowner whose property border on the fence and who receive financial support from the government reward system a reward system local a well from the government wa active from to the end of the century but there is no evidence that despite the billion of dollar spent it wa ever an efficient control method therefore it importance declined over timedingo scalping commenced in with the passage of the wild dog act by the government of south australia in an attempt to reduce depredation on livestock that government offered a bounty for dingo skin and this program wa later repeated in western australia and the northern territory one writer argues that this new legislation and economic driver had significant impact on aboriginal society in the region poisoning strychnine is still used in all part of australia bait with the poison are regarded a the fastest and safest method for dog control since they are extremely susceptible even small amount of poison per dog are sufficient mg per kg the application of aerial baiting is regulated in the commonwealth by the civil aviation regulation the assumption that the tiger quoll might be damaged by the poison led to the dwindling of area where aerial baiting could be performed in area where aerial baiting is no longer possible it is necessary to put down bait over the last year and protection collar filled with on certain spot have been testedthe eradication of dingo due to livestock damage decreased along with the importance of the sheep industry and the usage of strychnine which beforehand had been used for year in the the number of doggers also decreased and the frequency of aerial baiting increased during this period many farmer in western australia switched to the cattle industry and finding in the area of biology led to a significant change in control measure and technique in association with reduced cost and increased efficiency at the same time the importance of increasedin controversy surrounded a plan to inject a population of dingo on pelorus island off the coast of northern queensland australia with pill that would release a fatal dose of poison two year after the dingo were to be intentionally released to help eradicate goat the dingo were dubbed dingo and the plan wa blocked due to concern for a locally threatened shorebird neutering owner of dingo and other domestic dog are sometimes asked to neuter their pet and keep them under observation to reduce the number of dog and prevent interbreeding with dingo efficiency of measure the efficiency of control measure wa questioned in the past and is often questioned today a well a whether they stand in a good ratio the premium system proved to be susceptible to deception and to be useless on a large scale and can therefore only be used for getting rid of animal trap are considered inhumane and inefficient on a large scale due to the limited efficacy of bait based on study it is assumed that only young dog that would have died anyway can be captured furthermore wild dog are capable of learning and sometimes are able to detect and avoid trap quite efficiently in one case a dingo bitch followed a dogger and triggered his trap one after another by carefully pushing her paw through the sand that covered the trappoisonous bait can be very effective when they are of good meat quality however they do not last long and are occasionally taken by red fox quolls ant and bird aerial baiting can nearly eliminate whole dingo population livestock guardian dog can effectively minimise livestock loss but are le effective on wide open area with widely distributed livestock furthermore they can be a danger to the livestock or be killed by control measure themselves when they are not sufficiently supervised by their owner fence are reliable in keeping wild dog from entering certain area but they are expensive to build need permanent maintenance and only cause the problem to be relocated control measure mostly result in smaller pack and a disruption of pack structure the measure seem to be rather detrimental to the livestock industry because the empty territory are taken over by young dog and the predation then increase nonetheless it is regarded a unlikely that the control measure could completely eradicate the dingo in central australia and the elimination of all wild dog is not considered a realistic option it ha been shown that culling a small percentage of immature dingo on fraser island have little significant negative impact on the overall island population though this is being disputed conservation of purebred until the dingo wa categorised a of least concern on the red list of threatened specie in it wa recategorised a vulnerable following the decline in number to around of pure dingo due to crossbreeding with domestic dog in the iucn regarded the dingo a a feral dog and discarded it from the red listdingoes are reasonably abundant in large part of australia but there is some argument that they are endangered due to interbreeding with other dog in many part of their range dingo are not a protected specie but they are regulated under federal law and thus their status varies in different state and territory dingo receive varying level of protection in conservation area such a national park and natural reserve in new south wale the northern territory and victoria arnhem land and other aboriginal land unesco world heritage site and the whole of the australian capital territory in some state dingo are regarded a declared pest and landowner are allowed to control the local population throughout australia all other wild dog are considered pest fraser island is a square kilometre world heritage site located off australia eastern coast the island is home to a genetically distinct population of dingo that are free of dog introgression estimated to number these dingo are unique because they are closely related to the southeastern dingo but share a number of gene with the new guinea singing dog and show some evidence of admixture with the northwestern dingo because of their conservation value in february a report on fraser island dingo management strategy wa released with option including ending the intimidation of dingo tagging practice change and regular veterinarian checkup a well a a permanent dingo sanctuary on the island according to dna examination from the dingo of fraser island are pure a opposed to hybrid however skull measurement from the had a different result a study showed that dingo living in the tanami desert are among the purest in australiagroups that have devoted themselves to the conservation of the pure dingo by using breeding program include the australian native dog conservation society and the australian dingo conservation association presently the effort of the dingo conservation group are considered to be ineffective because most of their dog are untested or are known to be hybridsdingo conservation effort focus primarily on preventing interbreeding between dingo and other domestic dog in order to conserve the population of pure dingo this is extremely difficult and costly conservation effort are hampered by the fact that it is not known how many pure dingo still exist in australia step to conserve the pure dingo can only be effective when the identification of dingo and other domestic dog is absolutely reliable especially in the case of living specimen additionally conservation effort are in conflict with control measure conservation of pure and survivable dingo population is promising in remote area where contact with human and other domestic dog is rare under new south wale state policy in park reserve and other area not used by agriculture these population are only to be controlled when they pose a threat to the survival of other native specie the introduction of buffer zone around area with pure dingo is regarded a a realistic method to stop interbreeding this is enforced in the way that all wild dog can be killed outside of the conservation area however study from the year indicate that even an intensive control of core area is probably not able to stop the process of interbreedingaccording to the dingo discovery sanctuary and research centre many study are finding a case for the of the dingo into previously occupied area in order to return some balance to badly degraded area a a result of unregulated and ignorant farming practice dingo density have been measured at up to per square kilometre mi in both the guy fawkes river region of new south wale and in south australia at the height of a rabbit plague hybridisation european domestic dog first arrived in australia during the european colonisation these dog reverted to the wild both unintentionally and intentionally produced feral population and interbred with the existing dingo hybrid of dingo and domestic dog exist today in all wild dog population of australia with their number having increased to such a degree that any completely pure population may no longer domestic dog and can be generally distinguished from pure dingo by their fur colour since there is a wider range of colour and pattern among them than among dingo in addition the more kind of barking exists among the hybrid and difference in the breeding cycle certain skull characteristic and genetic analysis can be used for differentiation despite all the characteristic that can be used for distinguishing between dingo and other domestic dog there are two problem that should not be underestimated first there is no real clarity regarding at what point a dog is regarded a a pure dingo and secondly no distinguishing feature is completely is not known which characteristic permanently remain under the condition of natural selection there are two main opinion regarding this process of interbreeding the first and likely most common position state that the pure dingo should be preserved via strong control of the wild dog population and only pure or dingo should be protected the second position is relatively new and is of the opinion that people must accept that the dingo ha changed and that it is impossible to bring the pure dingo back conservation of these dog should therefore be based on where and how they live a well a their cultural and ecological role instead of concentrating on precise definition or concern about genetic purity both position are controversially discussed due to this interbreeding there is a wider range of fur colour skull shape and body size in the wild dog population than in the time before the arrival of the european over the course of the last year there ha been an increase of about in the average wild dog body size it is currently unknown whether in the case of the disappearance of pure dingo remaining hybrid would alter the predation pressure on other animal it is also unclear what kind of role these hybrid would play in the australian ecosystem however it is unlikely that the dynamic of the various ecosystem will be excessively disturbed by this processin a total of sample were included in the first dna study of wild dog the study found that were pure dingo which exhibited no dog allele gene expression there wa evidence of hybridisation in every region sampled in central australia only were hybrid however in southeastern australia were hybrid or feral dog pure dingo distribution wa in the northern territory intermediate number in western australia south australia and queensland and in new south wale and victoria almost all wild dog showed some dingo ancestry with only of dog showing le than dingo ancestry this indicates that domestic dog have a low survival rate in the wild or that most hybridisation is the result of roaming dog that return to their owner no population of feral dog have been found in australiain a three dimensional geometric morphometric analysis of the skull of dingo dog and their hybrid found that hybrid exhibit morphology closer to the dingo than to the parent group dog hybridisation did not push the unique canis dingo cranial morphology towards the wolf phenotype therefore hybrid can not be distinguished from dingo based on cranial measure the study suggests that the wild dingo morphology is dominant when compared with the recessive dog breed morphology and concludes that although hybridisation introduces dog dna into the dingo population the native cranial morphology remains resistant to change see also new
