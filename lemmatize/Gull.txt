gull or colloquially seagull are seabird of the family laridae in the suborder lari they are most closely related to the tern family sternidae and only distantly related to auk skimmer and even more distantly to wader until the century most gull were placed in the genus larus but that arrangement is now considered polyphyletic leading to the resurrection of several genus an older name for gull is mew which is cognate with german mowe danish mage swedish ma dutch meeuw and french mouette and can still be found in certain regional dialectsgulls are typically medium to large bird usually grey or white often with black marking on the head or wing they typically have harsh wailing or squawking call stout longish bill and webbed foot most gull are carnivore which take live food or scavenge opportunistically particularly the larus specie live food often includes crab and small fish gull have unhinging jaw which allow them to consume large prey gull are typically coastal or inland specie rarely venturing far out to sea except for the kittiwake the large specie take up to four year to attain full adult plumage but two year is typical for small gull large gull are typically bird with a maximum age of year recorded for the herring gullgulls nest in large densely packed noisy colony they lay two or three speckled egg in nest composed of vegetation the young are precocial born with dark mottled down and mobile upon hatching gull are resourceful inquisitive and intelligent the larger specie in particular demonstrating complex method of communication and a highly developed social structure for example many gull colony display mobbing behavior attacking and harassing predator and other intruder certain specie have exhibited behavior such a the herring gull using piece of bread a bait with which to catch goldfish for example many specie of gull have learned to coexist successfully with human and have thrived in human habitat others rely on kleptoparasitism to get their food gull have been observed preying on live whale landing on the whale a it surface to peck out piece of flesh description and morphology gull range in size from the little gull at gram ounce and centimetre inch to the great gull at kg lb oz and cm in they are generally uniform in shape with heavy body long wing and moderately long neck the tail of all but three specie are rounded the exception being sabine gull and gull which have forked tail and ross gull which ha a tail gull have moderately long leg especially when compared to the similar tern with fully webbed foot the bill is generally heavy and slightly hooked with the larger specie having stouter bill than the smaller specie the bill colour is often yellow with a red spot for the larger specie and red dark red or black in the smaller speciesthe gull are generalist feeder indeed they are the least specialised of all the seabird and their morphology allows for equal adeptness in swimming flying and walking they are more adept walking on land than most other seabird and the smaller gull tend to be more manoeuvrable while walking the walking gait of gull includes a slight side to side motion something that can be exaggerated in breeding display in the air they are able to hover and they are also able to take off quickly with little spacethe general pattern of plumage in adult gull is a white body with a darker mantle the extent to which the mantle is darker varies from pale grey to black a few specie vary in this the ivory gull is entirely white and some like the lava gull and heermann gull have partly or entirely grey body the wingtips of most specie are black which improves their resistance to wear and tear usually with a diagnostic pattern of white marking the head of a gull may be covered by a dark hood or be entirely white the plumage of the head varies by breeding season in nonbreeding gull the hood is lost sometimes leaving a single spot behind the eye and in gull nonbreeding head may have streaking distribution and habitat the gull have a worldwide cosmopolitan distribution they breed on every continent including the margin of antarctica and are found in the high arctic a well they are le common on tropical island although a few specie do live on island such a the galapagos and new caledonia many specie breed in coastal colony with a preference for island and one specie the grey gull breed in the interior of dry desert far from water considerable variety exists in the family and specie may breed and feed in marine freshwater or terrestrial habitatsmost gull specie are migratory with bird moving to warmer habitat during the winter but the extent to which they migrate varies by specie some migrate long distance like franklin gull which migrates from canada to wintering ground in the south of south america other specie move much shorter distance and may simply disperse along the coast near their breeding site behaviour diet and feeding charadriiform bird drink salt water a well a fresh water a they posse exocrine gland located in supraorbital groove of the skull by which salt can be excreted through the nostril to assist the kidney in maintaining electrolyte balance gull are highly adaptable feeder that opportunistically take a wide range of prey the food taken by gull includes fish and marine and freshwater invertebrate both alive and already dead terrestrial arthropod and invertebrate such a insect and earthworm rodent egg carrion offal reptile amphibian plant item such a seed and fruit human refuse chip and even other bird no gull specie is a specialist and no gull specie forage using only a single method the type of food depends on circumstance and terrestrial prey such a seed fruit and earthworm are more common during the breeding season while marine prey is more common in the nonbreeding season when bird spend more time on large body of water in addition to taking a wide range of prey gull display great versatility in how they obtain prey prey can be obtained in the air on water or on land in the air a number of hooded specie are able to hawk insect on the wing larger specie perform this feat more rarely gull on the wing also snatch item both off water and off the ground and over water they also to catch prey again smaller specie are more manoeuvrable and better able to fish from the air dipping is also common when bird are sitting on the water and gull may swim in tight circle or foot paddle to bring marine invertebrate up to the surface food is also obtained by searching the ground often on the shore among sand mud or rock larger gull tend to do more feeding in this way in shallow water gull may also engage in foot paddling a method of obtaining prey unique to gull involves dropping heavy shell of clam and mussel onto hard surface gull may fly some distance to find a suitable surface on which to drop shell and apparently a learned component to the task exists a older bird are more successful than younger one while overall feeding success is a function of age the diversity in both prey and feeding method is not the time taken to learn foraging skill may explain the delayed maturation in gullsgulls that are known to reside in area where there is a season of plentiful mouse have over the century developed a specialized method of eating them first the gull capture the mouse in a field next the gull fly to a convenient body of water the gull then regurgitates the mouse and dip it in the water biologist who first observed this habit observed it between mating pair of gull this initially led them to believe that the female wa washing off the mouse after it had been transported to the breeding area but when lone gull both male and female began to be seen doing this it wa finally concluded that the mouse being dry the first time it wa swallowed could become lodged in the gull throat a conclusion further corroborated when a male gull wa seen to struggle with the ejection of the mouse the mouse being partially ejected before getting stuck in the gull throat after to sizable gulp of water the mouse wa sufficiently moistened to allow the gull to completely eject the mouse by wetting the mouse the gull ensures that the mouse doe not become lodged in it throatgulls have only a limited ability to dive below the water to feed on deeper prey to obtain prey from deeper down many specie of gull feed in association with other animal where marine hunter drive prey to the surface when hunting example of such association include four specie of gull feeding around plume of mud brought to the surface by feeding grey whale and also between orca largest dolphin specie and kelp gull and other seabird breeding gull are monogamous and colonial breeder that display mate fidelity that usually last for the life of the pair divorce of mated pair doe occur but it apparently ha a social cost that persists for a number of year after the gull also display high level of site fidelity returning to the same colony after breeding there once and even usually breeding in the same location within that colony colony can vary from just a few pair to over a hundred thousand pair and may be exclusive to that gull specie or shared with other seabird specie a few specie nest singly and single pair of gull may breed in colony of other bird within colony gull pair are territorial defending an area of varying size around the nesting site from others of their specie this area can be a large a a radius around the nest in the herring gull to just a tiny area of cliff ledge in the kittiwakesmost gull breed once a year and have predictable breeding season lasting for three to five month gull begin to assemble around the colony for a few week prior to occupying the colony existing pair their and unpaired bird begin courting bird then move back into their territory and new male establish new territory and attempt to court female gull defend their territory from rival of both sex through call and aerial attack nest building is also part of the gull nest are usually mat of herbaceous matter with a central nest cup nest are usually built on the ground but a few specie build nest on cliff including the kittiwake which almost always nest in such habitat and in some case in tree and high place like bonaparte gull specie that nest in marsh must construct a nesting platform to keep the nest dry particularly in specie that nest in tidal marsh both sex gather nesting material and build the nest but the division of labour is not always exactly equal in coastal town many gull nest on rooftop and can be observed by nearby human resident clutch size is typically three egg although it is two in some of the smaller specie and only one egg for the gull within colony bird synchronise their laying with synchronisation being higher in larger colony although after a certain point this level off the egg of gull are usually dark tan to brown or dark olive with dark splotch and scrawl marking and are well camouflaged both sex incubate the egg with incubation bout lasting between one and four hour during the day and one parent incubating through the night research on various bird specie including the gull suggests that female form pair bond with other female to obtain alloparental care for their dependent offspring a behavior seen in other animal specie like the elephant wolf and the fathead minnowincubation last between and day and begin after laying the first egg although it is discontinuous until the second egg is laid this mean the first two chick are born close together and the third chick some time later young chick are brooded by their parent for about one or two week and often at least one parent remains with them until they fledge to guard them both parent feed the chick although early on in the rearing period the male doe most of the feeding and the female most of the brooding and guarding taxonomy the family laridae wa introduced a laridia by the french polymath constantine samuel rafinesque in the taxonomy of gull is confused by their widespread distribution zone of hybridization leading to geneflow some have traditionally been considered ring specie but recent evidence suggests that this assumption is questionable until recently most gull were placed in the genus larus but this arrangement is now known to be polyphyletic leading to the resurrection of the genus ichthyaetus chroicocephalus leucophaeus saundersilarus and hydrocoloeus some english name refer to specie complex within the group large gull is used to describe the or so herring specie from california gull to lesser gull in the taxonomic list below gull is used to describe the four high taxon within the former group these are iceland gull glaucous gull thayer gull and kumlien gullhybridisation between specie of gull occurs quite frequently although to varying degree depending on the specie involved the taxonomy of the large gull is particularly complicated in common usage member of various gull specie are often referred to a sea gull or seagull however seagull is a layperson term that is not used by most ornithologist and biologist this name is used informally to refer to a common local specie or all gull in general and ha no fixed taxonomic meaning in common usage seabird that are not technically gull eg albatross fulmar tern and skua may also be referred to a seagull by the layperson the american ornithologist union combine the sternidae stercorariidae and rhynchopidae a subfamily in the family laridae but

early miocene of france a fossil gull from the middle to late miocene of cherry county nebraska usa is placed in the prehistoric genus gaviota apart from this and the undescribed early oligocene fossil all prehistoric specie were tentatively assigned to the modern genus larus among those of them that have been confirmed a gull larus elegans and l totanoides from the late miocene of southeast
