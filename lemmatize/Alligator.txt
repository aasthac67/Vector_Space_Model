an alligator is a crocodilian in the genus alligator of the family alligatoridae the two living specie are the american alligator a mississippiensis and the chinese alligator a sinensis additionally several extinct specie of alligator are known from fossil remains alligator first appeared during the oligocene epoch about million year agothe name alligator is probably an anglicized form of el lagarto the spanish term for the lizard which early spanish explorer and settler in florida called the alligator later english spelling of the name included allagarta and alagarto description an average adult american alligator weight and length is kg lb and m ft but they sometimes grow to m ft long and weigh over kg lb the largest ever recorded found in louisiana measured m ft the chinese alligator is smaller rarely exceeding m ft in length additionally it weighs considerably le with male rarely over kg lb adult alligator are black or dark with white underside while juvenile have strongly contrasting white or yellow mark which fade with ageno average lifespan for an alligator ha been measured one of the oldest recorded alligator life wa that of saturn an american alligator who wa born in in mississippi and spent nearly a decade in germany before spending the majority of it life at the moscow zoo where it died at the age of or on may another one of the oldest life on record is that of muja an american alligator who wa brought a adult specimen to the belgrade zoo in serbia from germany in although no valid record exist about it date of birth it is now in it and possibly the oldest alligator living in captivity in the world specie extant extinct alligator mcgrewi alligator mefferdi alligator olseni alligator prenasalis habitat alligator are native to only the united state and chinaamerican alligator are found in the southeast united state all of florida and louisiana the southern part of georgia alabama and mississippi coastal south and north carolina east texas the southeast corner of oklahoma and the southern tip of arkansas according to the scholastic book of world record louisiana ha the largest alligator population the majority of american alligator inhabit florida and louisiana with over a million alligator in each state southern florida is the only place where both alligator and crocodile live side by sideamerican alligator live in freshwater environment such a pond marsh wetland river lake and swamp a well a in brackish water when they construct alligator hole in the wetland they increase plant diversity and provide habitat for other animal during drought they are therefore considered an important specie for maintaining ecological diversity in wetland farther west in louisiana heavy grazing by coypu and muskrat are causing severe damage to coastal wetland large alligator feed extensively on coypu and provide a vital ecological service by reducing coypu numbersthe chinese alligator currently is found in only the yangtze river valley and part of adjacent province and is extremely endangered with only a few dozen believed to be left in the wild indeed far more chinese alligator live in zoo around the world than can be found in the wild rockefeller wildlife refuge in southern louisiana ha several in captivity in an attempt to preserve the specie miami metrozoo in florida also ha a breeding pair of chinese alligator behavior large male alligator are solitary territorial animal smaller alligator can often be found in large number close to each other the largest of the specie both male and female defend prime territory smaller alligator have a higher tolerance for other alligator within a similar size class alligator move on land by two form of locomotion referred to a sprawl and high walk the sprawl is a forward movement with the belly making contact with the ground and is used to transition to high walk or to slither over wet substrate into water the high walk is an up on four limb forward motion used for overland travel with the belly well up from the ground alligator have also been observed to rise up and balance on their hind leg and forward a part of a forward or upward lunge however they can not walk on their hind leg for long distancesalthough the alligator ha a heavy body and a slow metabolism it is capable of short burst of speed especially in very short lunge alligator main prey are smaller animal they can kill and eat with a single bite they may kill larger prey by grabbing it and dragging it into the water to drown alligator consume food that can not be eaten in one bite by allowing it to rot or by biting and then spinning or convulsing wildly until chunk are torn off this is referred to a a death roll critical to the alligator ability to initiate a death roll the tail must flex to a significant angle relative to it body an alligator with an immobilized tail can not perform a death rollmost of the muscle in an alligator jaw evolved to bite and grip prey the muscle that close the jaw are exceptionally powerful but the muscle for opening their jaw are comparatively weak a a result an adult human can hold an alligator jaw shut it is common today to use several wrap of duct tape to prevent an adult alligator from opening it jaw when being handled or transportedalligators are generally timid towards human and tend to walk or swim away if one approach this ha led some people to the practice of approaching alligator and their nest in a manner that may provoke the animal into attacking in florida feeding wild alligator at any time is illegal if fed the alligator will eventually lose their fear of human and will learn to associate human with food thereby becoming both a greater danger to people and at greater risk from them diet the type of food eaten by alligator depends upon their age and size when young alligator eat fish insect snail crustacean and worm a they mature progressively larger prey is taken including larger fish such a gar turtle and various mammal particularly coypu and muskrat a well a bird deer and other reptile their stomach also often contain gizzard stone they will even consume carrion if they are sufficiently hungry in some case larger alligator are known to ambush dog florida panther and black bear making them the apex predator throughout their distribution in this role a a top predator it may determine the abundance of prey specie including turtle and coypu a human encroach into their habitat attack are few but not unknown alligator unlike the large crocodile do not immediately regard a human upon encounter a prey but may still attack in if provoked reproduction alligator generally mature at a length of ft m the mating season is in late spring in april and may alligator form bellowing chorus large group of animal bellow together for a few minute a few time a day usually one to three hour after sunrise the bellow of male american alligator are accompanied by powerful blast of infrasound another form of male display is a loud in on spring night alligator were found to gather in large number for group courtship the alligator dance in summer the female build a nest of vegetation where the decomposition of the vegetation provides the heat needed to incubate the egg the sex of the offspring is determined by the temperature in the nest and is fixed within seven to day of the start of incubation incubation temperature of or lower produce a clutch of female those of or higher produce entirely male nest constructed on leaf are hotter than those constructed on wet marsh so the former tend to produce male and the latter female the baby alligator egg tooth help it get out of it egg during hatching time the natural sex ratio at hatching is five female to one male female hatched from egg incubated at weigh significantly more than male hatched from egg incubated at the mother defends the nest from predator and assist the hatchling to water she will provide protection to the young for about a year if they remain in the area adult alligator regularly cannibalize younger individual though estimate of the rate of cannibalism vary widely in the past immediately following the outlawing of alligator hunting population rebounded quickly due to the suppressed number of adult preying upon juvenile increasing survival among the young alligator anatomy alligator are similar to crocodile and caiman for their common characteristic and difference among them see crocodilia alligator much like bird have been shown to exhibit unidirectional movement of air through their lung most other amniote are believed to exhibit bidirectional or tidal breathing for a tidal breathing animal such a a mammal air flow into and out of the lung through branching bronchus which terminate in small chamber called alveolus a the alveolus represent to flow the inspired air must move back out the same way it came in in contrast air in alligator lung make a circuit moving in only one direction through the parabronchi the air first enters the outer branch move through the parabronchi and exit the lung through the inner branch oxygen exchange take place in extensive vasculature around the parabronchilike other crocodilian alligator have an armor of bony scute the dermal bone are highly vascularised and aid in calcium balance both to neutralize acid while the animal can not breathe underwater and to provide calcium for eggshell formationalligators have muscular flat tail that propel them while swimming the two kind of white alligator are albino and leucistic these alligator are practically impossible to find in the wild they could survive only in captivity and are few in number the aquarium of the america in new orleans ha leucistic alligator found in a louisiana swamp in human us alligator are raised commercially for their meat and their skin which when tanned is used for the manufacture of luggage handbag shoe belt and other leather item alligator also provide economic benefit through the ecotourism industry visitor may take swamp tour in which alligator are a feature their most important economic benefit to human may be the control of coypu and muskratsalligator meat is also consumed by human in the archbishop of new orleans ruled that for purpose of catholic church discipline in relation to abstention from meat the flesh of the alligator is characterised a fish difference from crocodile while there are rule of thumb for distinguishing alligator from crocodile all of them admit exception such general rule include exposed v interdigitated teeth the easiest way to distinguish crocodile from alligator is by looking at their jaw line the teeth on the lower jaw of an alligator fit into socket in the upper jaw leaving only the upper teeth visible when the mouth is closed the teeth on the lower jaw of a crocodile fit into groove on the outside of the top jaw making both the upper and lower teeth visible when the mouth is closed thus creating a toothy grin shape of the nose and jaw alligator have wider snout while crocodile snout are typically more pointed or the alligator broader snout have been thought to allow their jaw to withstand the stress of cracking open the shell of turtle and other animal that are widespread in their environment however a study found very little correlation between bite force and snout shape amongst tested crocodilian speciesfunctioning salt gland crocodilian have modified salivary gland called salt gland on their tongue but while these organ still excrete salt in crocodile and gharials those in most alligator and caiman have lost this ability or excrete it in only extremely small quantity the ability to excrete excess salt allows crocodile to better tolerate life in saline water and migrating through it because alligator and caiman have lost this ability they are largely restricted to freshwater habitat although larger alligator do sometimes live in tidal mangrove and in very rare case in coastal areasintegumentary sense organ both crocodile and alligator have small sensory organ called integumentary sense organ isos or dermal pressure receptor dprs surrounding their upper and lower jaw these organ allow crocodilian to detect minor pressure change in surrounding water and assist them in locating and capturing prey in crocodile however such organ extend over nearly the entire body crocodile isos may also assist in detection of local salinity or serve other chemosensory functionsless consistent difference crocodile are generally thought of a more aggressive than alligator only six of the crocodilian specie are considered dangerous to adult human being most notably the nile crocodile and saltwater crocodile each year hundred of deadly attack are attributed to the nile crocodile in africa the american crocodile is considered to be le aggressive only a few unverified case of american crocodile fatally attacking human have been reported alligator also tend to be larger than most crocodile specie however there are numerous exception to these rule image gallery of extant specie see also crocodile caiman gharial list of fatal alligator attack in the united
