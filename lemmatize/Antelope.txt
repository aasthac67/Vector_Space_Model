the term antelope is used to refer to many specie of ruminant indigenous to various region in africa and eurasia antelope comprise a wastebasket taxon miscellaneous group within the family bovidae encompassing all old world ruminant that are not bovine sheep or goat antelope are considered the sister group to deer within the infraorder pecora a group of antelope is called a herdunlike deer antler which are shed and grown annually antelope horn grow continuously etymology the english word antelope first appeared in and is derived from the old french antelop itself derived from medieval latin ant h alopus which in turn come from the byzantine greek word antholops first attested in eustathius of antioch c according to whom it wa a fabulous animal haunting the bank of the euphrates very savage hard to catch and having long horn capable of cutting down tree it perhaps derives from greek anthos flower and ops eye perhaps meaning beautiful eye or alluding to the animal long eyelash this however may be a later folk etymology the word talopus and calopus from latin came to be used in heraldry in it wa first used for living cervine animal specie the antelope specie most of which are native to africa occur in about genus the classification of tribe or subfamily within bovidae is still a matter of debate with several alternative system proposed antelope are not a cladistic or taxonomically defined group the term is used to describe all member of the family bovidae that do not fall under the category of sheep cattle or goat usually all specie of the alcelaphinae antilopinae hippotraginae reduncinae cephalophinae many bovinae the grey rhebok and the impala are called antelope distribution and habitat more specie of antelope are native to africa than to any other continent almost exclusively in savannah with specie over much of east africa because savannah habitat in africa ha expanded and contracted five time over the last three million year and the fossil record indicates this is when most extant specie evolved it is believed that isolation in refugia during contraction wa a major driver of this diversification other specie occur in asia the arabian peninsula is home to the arabian oryx and dorcas gazelle india is home to the nilgai chinkara blackbuck tibetan antelope and antelope while russia and central asia have the tibetan antelope and saiga no antelope specie is native to australasia or antarctica nor do any extant specie occur in the america though the nominate saiga subspecies occurred in north america during the pleistocene north america is currently home to the native pronghorn which taxonomist do not consider a member of the antelope group but which is often locally referred to a such eg american antelope in europe several extinct specie occur in the fossil record and the saiga wa found widely during the pleistocene but did not persist into the later holocene except in russian kalmykia and astrakhan oblastmany specie of antelope have been imported to other part of the world especially the united state for exotic game hunting with some specie possessing spectacular leaping and evasive skill individual may escape texas in particular ha many game ranch a well a habitat and climate that are very hospitable to african and asian plain antelope specie accordingly wild population of blackbuck antelope gemsbok and nilgai may be found in texasantelope live in a wide range of habitat numerically most live in the african savannah however many specie are more secluded such a the forest antelope a well a the extreme saiga the arabian oryx the rocky klipspringer and semiaquatic sitatungaspecies living in forest woodland or bush tend to be sedentary but many of the plain specie undertake long migration these enable specie to follow the rain and thereby their food supply the gnu and gazelle of east africa perform some of the most impressive mass migratory circuit of all mammal morphology antelope vary greatly in size for example a male common eland can measure cm ft in at the shoulder and weigh almost kg lb whereas an adult royal antelope may stand only cm in at the shoulder and weigh a mere kg lb not surprisingly for animal with long slender yet powerful leg many antelope have long stride and can run fast some eg klipspringer are also adapted to inhabiting rock koppie and crag both dibatags and gerenuk habitually stand on their two hind leg to reach acacia and other tree foliage different antelope have different body type which can affect movement duikers are short antelope that can pick through dense foliage and dive into the shadow rapidly gazelle and springbok are known for their speed and leaping ability even larger antelope such a nilgai eland and kudu are capable of jumping m ft in or greater although their running speed is restricted by their greater mass antelope have a wide variety of covering though most have a dense coat of short fur in most specie the coat pelage is some variation of a brown colour or several shade of brown often with white or pale underbody exception include the zebra duiker the grey black and white jentink duiker and the black lechwe most of the antelope have pale vertical stripe on their back many desert and semidesert specie are particularly pale some almost silvery or whitish eg arabian oryx the beisa and southern oryx have gray and black pelage with vivid face common feature of various gazelle are white rump which flash a warning to others when they run from danger and dark stripe midbody the latter feature is also shared by the springbok and beira the springbok also ha a pouch of white brushlike hair running along it back which open up when the animal sens danger causing the dorsal hair to stand on end antelope are ruminant so have molar teeth which grind cud food ball stored in the stomach into a pulp for further digestion they have no upper incisor but rather a hard upper gum pad against which their lower incisor bite to tear grass stem and leaf like many other herbivore antelope rely on keen sens to avoid predator their eye are placed on the side of their head giving them a broad radius of vision with minimal binocular vision their horizontally elongated pupil also help in this respect acute sens of smell and hearing give antelope the ability to perceive danger at night out in the open when predator are often on the prowl these same sens play an important role in contact between individual of the same specie marking on their head ear leg and rump are used in such communication many specie flash such marking a well a their tail vocal communication include loud bark whistle moo and trumpeting many specie also use scent marking to define their territory or simply to maintain contact with their relative and neighbor many antelope are sexually dimorphic in most specie both sex have horn but those of male tend to be larger male tend to be larger than the female but exception in which the female tend to be heavier than the male include the bush duiker dwarf antelope cape grysbok and oribi all rather small specie a number of specie have hornless female eg sitatunga red lechwe and suni in some specie the male and female have differently coloured pelage eg blackbuck and nyala the size and shape of antelope horn varies greatly those of the duikers and dwarf antelope tend to be simple spike but differ in the angle to the head from backward curved and backward pointing eg duiker to straight and upright eg steenbok other group have twisted eg common eland spiral eg greater kudu recurved eg the reedbucks lyrate eg impala or long curved eg the oryx horn horn are not shed and their bony core are covered with a thick persistent sheath of horny material both of which distinguish them from antlershorns are efficient weapon and tend to be better developed in those specie where male fight over female large herd antelope than in solitary or lekking specie with competition for mate horn are clashed in combat male more commonly use their horn against each other than against another specie the bos of the horn is typically arranged in such a way that two antelope striking at each other horn can not crack each other skull making a fight via horn more ritualized than dangerous many specie have ridge in their horn for at least the length of their horn but these ridge are not a direct indicator of age behavior mating strategy antelope are often classified by their reproductive behavior small antelope such a tend to be monogamous they live in a forest environment with patchy resource and a male is unable to monopolize more than one female due to this sparse distribution larger forest specie often form very small herd of two to four female and one male some specie such a lechwe pursue a lek breeding system where the male gather on a lekking ground and compete for a small territory while the female appraise male and choose one with which to mate large grazing antelope such a impala or wildebeest form large herd made up of many female and a single breeding male which excludes all other male often by combat defense antelope pursue a number of defense strategy often dictated by their morphology large antelope that gather in large herd such a wildebeest rely on number and running speed for protection in some specie adult will encircle the offspring protecting them from predator when threatened many forest antelope rely on cryptic coloring and good hearing to avoid predator forest antelope often have very large ear and dark or striped coloration small antelope especially duikers evade predation by jumping into dense bush where the predator can not pursue springbok use a behavior known a stotting to confuse predator open grassland specie have nowhere to hide from predator so they tend to be fast runner they are agile and have good are advantage when pursued by predator such a cheetah which are the fastest of land animal but tire quickly reaction distance vary with predator specie and behaviour for example gazelle may not flee from a lion until it is closer than m ft hunt a a pride or by surprise usually by stalking one that can be seen clearly is unlikely to attack however cheetah will cause gazelle to flee at a range of over metre mile status about specie are rated by the iucn a endangered such a the dama gazelle and mountain nyala a number of subspecies are also endangered including the giant sable antelope and the mhorr gazelle the main cause for concern for these specie are habitat loss competition with cattle for grazing and trophy hunting the chiru or tibetan antelope is hunted for it pelt which is used in making shahtoosh wool used in shawl since the fur can only be removed from dead animal and each animal yield very little of the downy fur several antelope must be killed to make a single shawl this unsustainable demand ha led to enormous decline in the chiru populationthe saiga is hunted for it horn which are considered an aphrodisiac by some culture only the male have horn and have been so heavily hunted that some herd contain up to female to one male the specie ha shown a steep decline and is critically endangered lifespan it is difficult to determine how long antelope live in the wild with the preference of predator towards old and infirm individual which can no longer sustain peak speed few wild live a long a their biological potential in captivity wildebeest have lived beyond year old and impala have reached their late teen human culture the antelope horn is prized for supposed medicinal and magical power in many place the horn of the male saiga in eastern practice is ground a an aphrodisiac for which it ha been hunted nearly to extinction in the congo it is thought to confine spirit christian iconography sometimes us the antelope two horn a a symbol of the two spiritual weapon christian posse the old testament and the new testament the antelope ability to run swiftly ha also led to their association with the wind such a in the rig veda a the steed of the marut and the wind god vayu there is however no scientific evidence that the horn of any antelope have any change on a human physiology or characteristic in mali antelope were believed to have brought the skill of agriculture to mankindhumans have also used the term antelope to refer to a tradition usually found in the sport of track and field domestication domestication of animal requires certain trait in the animal that antelope do not typically display most specie are difficult to contain in any density due to the territoriality of the male or in the case of oryx which have a relatively hierarchical social structure an aggressive disposition they can easily kill a human because many have extremely good jumping ability providing adequate fencing is a challenge also antelope will consistently display a fear response to perceived predator such a human making them very difficult to herd or handle although antelope have diet and rapid growth rate highly suitable for domestication this tendency to panic and their nonhierarchical social structure explains why antelope are uncommon ancient egyptian kept herd of gazelle and addax for meat and occasionally pet it is unknown whether they were truly domesticated but it seems unlikely a no domesticated gazelle exist today however human have had success taming certain specie such a the eland these antelope sometimes jump over each other back when alarmed but this incongruous talent seems to be exploited only by wild member of the specie tame eland do not take advantage of it and can be enclosed within a very low fence their meat milk and hide are all of excellent quality and experimental eland husbandry ha been going on for some year in both ukraine and zimbabwe in both location the animal ha proved wholly amenable to domestication similarly european visitor to arabia reported tame gazelle are very common in the asiatic country of which the specie is a native and the poetry of these country abounds in allusion both to the beauty and the gentleness of the gazelle other antelope that have been tamed successfully include the gemsbok the kudu and the springbok nor are the characteristic described above necessarily barrier to domestication for further information see animal domestication hybrid antelope a wide variety of antelope hybrid have been recorded in zoo game park and wildlife ranch due to either a lack of more appropriate mate in enclosure shared with other specie or a misidentification of specie the ease of hybridization show how closely related some antelope specie are with few exception most hybrid antelope occur only in captivity most hybrid occur between specie within the same genus all reported example occur within the same subfamily a with most mammal hybrid the le closely related the parent the more likely the offspring will be sterile heraldry antelope are a common symbol in heraldry though they occur in a highly distorted form from nature the heraldic antelope ha the body of a stag and the tail of a lion with serrated horn and a small tusk at the end of it snout this bizarre and inaccurate form wa invented by european herald in the middle age who knew little of foreign animal and made up the rest the antelope wa mistakenly imagined to be a monstrous beast of prey the century poet edmund spenser referred to it a being a fierce and fell a a wolf antelope can all also occur in their natural form in which case they are termed natural antelope to distinguish them from the more usual heraldic antelope the arm previously used by the republic of south africa featured a natural antelope along with an oryx see also megafauna reference
