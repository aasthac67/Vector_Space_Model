the cuckoo are a family of bird cuculidae the sole taxon in the order cuculiformes the cuckoo family includes the common or european cuckoo roadrunner koels malkohas couas coucal and ani the coucal and ani are sometimes separated a distinct family the centropodidae and crotophagidae respectively the cuckoo order cuculiformes is one of three that make up the otidimorphae the other two being the turaco and the bustard the cuckoo are generally slender bird most specie live in tree though a sizeable minority are the family ha a cosmopolitan distribution with the majority of specie being tropical some specie are migratory the cuckoo feed on insect insect larva and a variety of other animal a well a fruit some specie are brood parasite laying their egg in the nest of other specie but the majority of specie raise their own young cuckoo have played a role in human culture for thousand of year appearing in greek mythology a sacred to the goddess hera in europe the cuckoo is associated with spring and with cuckoldry for example in shakespeare love labour lost in india cuckoo are sacred to kamadeva the god of desire and longing whereas in japan the cuckoo symbolises unrequited love description cuckoo are bird that range in size from the little bronze cuckoo at g and cm inch to the cuckoo at g lb and cm inch there is generally little sexual dimorphism in size but where it exists it can be either the male or the female that is larger one of the most important distinguishing feature of the family are the foot which are zygodactyl meaning that the two inner toe point forward and the two outer backward there are two basic body form arboreal specie like the common cuckoo which are slender and have short tarsus and terrestrial specie like the roadrunner which are more heavy set and have long tarsus almost all specie have long tail which are used for steering in terrestrial specie and a a rudder during flight in the arboreal specie the wing shape also varies with lifestyle with the more migratory specie like the cuckoo possessing long narrow wing capable of strong direct flight and the more terrestrial and sedentary cuckoo like the coucal and malkohas having shorter rounded wing and a more laboured gliding flightthe subfamily cuculinae are the cuckoo of the old world they tend to conform to the classic shape with usually long tail short leg long narrow wing and an arboreal lifestyle the largest specie the cuckoo also ha the most outsized bill in the family resembling that of a hornbill the subfamily phaenicophaeinae are the cuckoo of the old world and include the couas malkohas and they are more terrestrial cuckoo with strong and often long leg and short rounded wing the subfamily typically ha brighter plumage and brightly coloured bare skin around the eye the coucal are another terrestrial old world subfamily of long tailed long legged and short winged cuckoo they are large heavyset bird with the largest the greater black coucal being around the same size a the cuckoo the subfamily coccyzinae are arboreal and long tailed a well with a number of large insular form the new world ground cuckoo are similar to the asian in being long legged and terrestrial and includes the long billed roadrunner which can reach speed of when chasing prey the final subfamily are the atypical ani which include the small clumsy ani and the larger guira cuckoo the ani have massive bill and smooth glossy feather the feather of the cuckoo are generally soft and often become waterlogged in heavy rain cuckoo often sun themselves after rain and the ani hold their wing open in the manner of a vulture or cormorant while drying there is considerable variation in the plumage exhibited by the family some specie particularly the brood parasite have cryptic plumage whereas others have bright and elaborate plumage this is particularly true of the chrysococcyx or glossy cuckoo which have iridescent plumage some cuckoo have a resemblance to hawk in the genus accipiter with barring on the underside this apparently alarm potential host allowing the female to access a host nest the young of some brood parasite are coloured so a to resemble the young of the host for example the asian koels breeding in india have black offspring to resemble their crow host whereas in the australian koels the chick are brown like the honeyeater host sexual dimorphism in plumage is uncommon in the cuckoo being most common in the parasitic old world specie cuckoo genus differ in the number of primary wing feather a below coccycua coccyzus phaenicophaeus piaya cuculus or pachycoccyx clamator levaillantii centropus microdynamis eudynamys clamator glandarius some coucal scythrops novaehollandiae distribution and habitat the cuckoo have a cosmopolitan distribution ranging across all the world continent except antarctica they are absent from the south west of south america the far north and north west of north america and the driest area of the middle east and north africa although they occur there a passage migrant they generally only occur a vagrant in the oceanic island of the atlantic and indian ocean but one specie breed on a number of pacific island and another is a winter migrant across much of the pacificcuculinae is the most widespread subfamily of cuckoo and is distributed across europe asia africa australia and oceania amongst the phaenicophaeinae cuckoo the malkohas and asian are restricted to southern asia the couas are endemic to madagascar and the yellowbill widespread across africa the coucal are distributed from africa through tropical asia down into australia and the solomon island the remaining three subfamily have a new world distribution all three are found in both north and south america the coccyzinae reach the furthest north of the three subfamily breeding in canada whereas the ani reach a far north a florida and the typical the south west united state for the cuckoo suitable habitat provides a source of food principally insect and especially caterpillar and a place to breed for brood parasite the need is for suitable habitat for the host specie cuckoo occur in a wide variety of habitat the majority of specie occur in forest and woodland principally in the evergreen rainforest of the tropic some specie inhabit or are even restricted to mangrove forest these include the little bronze cuckoo of australia some malkohas coucal and the mangrove cuckoo of the new world in addition to forest some specie of cuckoo occupy more open environment this can include even arid area like desert in the case of the greater roadrunner or the pallid cuckoo temperate migratory specie like the common cuckoo inhabit a wide range of habitat in order to make maximum use of the potential brood host from reed bed where they parasitise reed warbler to treeless moor where they parasitise meadow pipit migration most specie of cuckoo are sedentary but some undertake regular seasonal migration and others undertake partial migration over part of their range specie breeding at higher latitude migrate to warmer climate during the winter due to food availability the koel which breed in new zealand fly to it wintering ground in polynesia micronesia and melanesia a feat described a perhaps the most remarkable overwater migration of any land bird the cuckoo and cuckoo breed in north america and fly across the caribbean sea a flight of km other long migration flight include the lesser cuckoo which fly from africa to india and the common cuckoo of europe which fly over the mediterranean sea and sahara desert on the voyage between europe and central africawithin africa ten specie make regular migration that are described a polarised that is they spend the season in the tropical centre of the continent and move north and south to breed in the more arid and open savannah and desert this is the same a the situation in the neotropics where no specie have this migration pattern or tropical asia where a single specie doe of the australian specie are partial migrant within australia or travel to new guinea and indonesia after the breeding seasonin some specie the migration is diurnal a in the cuckoo or nocturnal a in the cuckoo behaviour and ecology the cuckoo are for the most part solitary bird that seldom occur in pair or group the biggest exception to this are the ani of the america which have evolved cooperative breeding and other social behaviour for the most part the cuckoo are also diurnal a opposed to nocturnal but many specie call at night see below the cuckoo are also generally a shy and retiring family more often heard than seen the exception to this are again the ani which are often extremely trusting towards human and other specie most cuckoo are insectivorous and in particular are specialised in eating larger insect and caterpillar including noxious hairy type avoided by other bird they are unusual among bird in processing their prey prior to swallowing rubbing it back and forth on hard object such a branch and then crushing it with special bony plate in the back of the mouth they also take a wide range of other insect and animal prey the lizard cuckoo of the caribbean have in the relative absence of bird of prey specialised in taking lizard larger ground type such a coucal and roadrunner also feed variously on snake lizard small rodent and other bird which they bludgeon with their strong bill ground specie may employ different technique to catch prey a study of two coua specie in madagascar found that the coquerel coua obtained prey by walking and gleaning on the forest floor whereas the coua ran and pounced on prey both specie also showed seasonal flexibility in prey and foraging technique the parasitic cuckoo are generally not recorded a participating in feeding flock although some study in eastern australia found several specie participated in the season but were mobbed and unable to do so in the breeding season of the genus neomorphus are sometimes seen feeding in association with army ant swarm although they are not obligate a are some antbird the ani are ground feeder that follow cattle and other large mammal when foraging in a similar fashion to cattle egret they snatch prey flushed by the cattle and enjoy higher foraging success rate in this wayseveral koels couas and the cuckoo feed mainly on fruit but they are not exclusively frugivores the parasitic koels and cuckoo in particular consume mainly fruit when raised by frugivore host such a the australasian figbird and pied currawong other specie occasionally take fruit a well couas consume fruit in the dry season when prey is harder to find breeding the cuckoo are an extremely diverse group of bird with regard to breeding system the majority of specie are monogamous but there are exception the ani and the guira cuckoo lay their egg in communal nest which is built by all member of the group incubation brooding and territorial defence duty are shared by all member of the group within these specie the ani breed a group of monogamous pair but the guira cuckoo are not monogamous within the group exhibiting a polygynandrous breeding system this group nesting behaviour is not completely cooperative female compete and may remove others egg when laying hers egg are usually only ejected early in the breeding season in the ani but can be ejected at any time by guria cuckoo polyandry ha been confirmed in the african black coucal and is suspected to occur in the other coucal perhaps explaining the reversed sexual dimorphism in the groupthe majority of cuckoo specie including malkohas couas coucal and roadrunner and most other american cuckoo build their own nest although a large minority engage in brood parasitism see below most of these specie nest in tree or bush but the coucal lay their egg in nest on the ground or in low shrub though on some occasion cuckoo parasitize other specie the parent still help feed the chick the nest of cuckoo vary in the same way a the breeding system the nest of malkohas and asian ground cuckoo are shallow platform of twig but those of coucal are globular or domed nest of grass the new world cuckoo build saucer or bowl in the case of the new world ground cuckoo like most other lay white egg but many of the parasitic specie lay coloured egg to match those of their passerine host the young of all specie are altricial cuckoo leave the nest before they can fly and some new world specie have the shortest incubation period among bird brood parasitism about of the old world specie and of the new world specie pheasant pavonine and striped are brood parasite laying their egg in the nest of other bird these specie are obligate brood parasite meaning that they only reproduce in this fashion the example is the european common cuckoo in addition to the above noted specie yet others sometimes engage in brood parasitism laying their egg in the nest of member of their own specie in addition to raising their own young the shell of the egg of are usually thick they have two distinct layer with an outer chalky layer that is believed to provide resistance to cracking when the egg are dropped in the host nest the cuckoo egg hatch earlier than the host and the cuckoo chick grows faster in most case the chick evicts the egg or young of the host specie the chick ha no time to learn this behavior so it must be an instinct passed on genetically the chick encourages the host to keep pace with it high growth rate with it rapid begging call and the chick open mouth which serf a a sign stimulussince obligate brood parasite need to successfully trick their host in order for them to reproduce they have evolved adaptation at several stage of breeding however there are high cost of parasitism on the host leading to strong selection on host to recognize and reject parasitic egg the adaptation and between host and parasite have led to a coevolution arm race this mean that if one of the specie involved were to stop adapting it would lose the race to the other specie resulting in decreased fitness of the losing specie the adaptation is the best studied stage of this arm race cuckoo have various strategy for getting their egg into host nest different specie use different strategy based on host defensive strategy female cuckoo have secretive and fast laying behavior but in some case male have been shown to lure host adult away from their nest so that the female can lay her egg in the nest some host specie may directly try to prevent cuckoo laying egg in their nest in the first place bird whose nest are at high risk of are known to cuckoo to drive them out of the area parasitic cuckoo are grouped into gens with each gen specializing in a particular host there is some evidence that the gens are genetically different from one another female parasitic cuckoo sometimes specialize and lay egg that closely resemble the egg of their chosen host some bird are able to distinguish cuckoo egg from their own leading to those egg least like the host being thrown out of the nest parasitic cuckoo that show the highest level of egg mimicry are those whose host exhibit high level of egg rejection behavior some host do not exhibit egg rejection behavior and the cuckoo egg look very dissimilar from the host egg it ha also been shown in a study of the european common cuckoo that female will lay their egg in the nest of a host that ha egg that look similar to it own other specie of cuckoo lay cryptic egg which are dark in color when their host egg are light this is a trick to hide the egg from the host and is exhibited in cuckoo that parasitize host with dark domed nest some adult parasitic cuckoo completely destroy the host clutch if they reject the cuckoo egg in this case raising the cuckoo chick is le of a cost than the alternative total clutch destruction there are two main hypothesis on the cognitive mechanism that mediate host distinguishing of egg one hypothesis is true recognition which state that a host compare egg present in it clutch to an internal template learnt or innate to identify if parasitic egg are present however memorizing a template of a parasitic egg is costly and imperfect and likely not identical to each host egg the other one is the discordancy hypothesis which state that host compare egg in the clutch and identifies the odd one however if parasitic egg made the majority of egg in the clutch then host will end up rejecting their own egg more recent study have found that it is more likely that both mechanism contribute to host discrimination of parasitic egg since one compensates for the limitation of the otherthe parasitism is not necessarily entirely detrimental to the host specie a dataset wa used in to find that parasitized crow nest were more successful overall more likely to produce at least one crow fledgling than nest the researcher attributed this to a substance secreted by cuckoo chick when attacked and noted that the interaction were not necessarily simply parasitic or mutualistic call cuckoo are often highly secretive and in many case best known for their wide repertoire of call call are usually relatively simple resembling whistle flute or hiccup the call are used in order to demonstrate ownership of a territory and to attract a mate within a specie the call are remarkably consistent across the range even in specie with very large range this suggests along with the fact that many specie are not raised by their true parent that the call of cuckoo are innate and not learnt although cuckoo are diurnal many specie call at nightthe cuckoo family get it english and scientific name from the call of the common cuckoo which is also familiar from cuckoo clock some of the name of other specie and genus are also derived from their call for example the koels of asia and australasia in most cuckoo the call are distinctive to particular specie and are useful for identification several cryptic specie are best identified on the basis of their call phylogeny and evolution the family cuculidae wa introduced by the english zoologist william elford leach in a guide to the content of the british museum published in is very little fossil record of cuckoo and their evolutionary history remains unclear
