the alpaca vicugna pacos is a specie of south american camelid mammal it is similar to and often confused with the llama however alpaca are often noticeably smaller than llama the two animal are closely related and can successfully both specie are believed to have been domesticated from their wild relative the vicuna and guanaco there are two breed of alpaca the suri alpaca and the huacaya alpaca alpaca are kept in herd that graze on the level height of the andes of southern peru western bolivia ecuador and northern chile at an altitude of to metre to foot above sea level alpaca are considerably smaller than llama and unlike llama they were not bred to be working animal but were bred specifically for their fiber alpaca fiber is used for making knitted and woven item similar to sheep wool these item include blanket sweater hat glove scarf a wide variety of textile and poncho in south america and sweater sock coat and bedding in other part of the world the fiber come in more than natural color a classified in peru a classified in australia and a classified in the united state alpaca communicate through body language the most common is spitting when they are in distress fearful or mean to show dominance male alpaca are more aggressive than female and tend to establish dominance of their herd group in some case alpha male will immobilize the head and neck of a weaker or challenging male in order to show their strength and dominance in the textile industry alpaca primarily refers to the hair of peruvian alpaca but more broadly it refers to a style of fabric originally made from alpaca hair such a mohair icelandic sheep wool or even wool from other breed of sheep in trade distinction are made between alpaca and the several style of mohair and lusteran adult alpaca generally is between and centimetre and inch in height at the shoulder withers they usually weigh between and kilogram and pound background the relationship between alpaca and vicuna wa disputed for many year in the and century the four south american lamoid specie were assigned scientific name at that time the alpaca wa assumed to be descended from the llama ignoring similarity in size fleece and dentition between the alpaca and the vicuna classification wa complicated by the fact that all four specie of south american camelid can interbreed and produce fertile offspring the advent of dna technology made a more accurate classification possible in the alpaca genus classification changed from lama pacos to vicugna pacos following the presentation of a paper on work by miranda kadwell et al on alpaca dna to the royal society showing the alpaca is descended from the vicuna not the guanaco origin and domestication alpaca were domesticated thousand of year ago the moche people of northern peru often used alpaca image in their art there are no known wild alpaca and it closest living relative the vicuna also native to south america is the wild ancestor of the alpaca the family camelidae first appeared in america million year ago during the eocene period from the common ancestor protylopus the descendant divided into camelini and lamini tribe taking different migratory pattern to asia and south america respectively although the camelids became extinct in north america around million year ago it flourished in the south with the specie we see today it wa not until million year ago during the pliocene that the genus hemiauchenia of the tribe lamini split into palaeolama and lama the latter would then split again into lama and vicugna upon migrating down to south america remains of vicuna and guanaco have been found throughout peru for around year their domesticated counterpart the llama and alpaca have been found mummified in the moquegua valley in the south of peru dating back to year mummy found in this region show two breed of alpaca more precise analysis of bone and teeth of these mummy ha demonstrated that alpaca were domesticated from the vicugna vicugna other research considering the behavioral and morphological characteristic of alpaca and their wild counterpart seems to indicate that alpaca could find their origin in lama guanicoe a well a vicugna vicugna or even a hybrid of both genetic analysis show a different picture of the origin of the alpaca analysis of mitochondrial dna show that most alpaca have guanaco mtdna and many also have vicuna mtdna but microsatellite data show that alpaca dna is much more similar to vicuna dna than to guanaco dna this suggests that alpaca are descendant of the vicugna vicugna not of the lama guanicoe the discrepancy with mtdna seems to be a result of the fact that mtdna is only transmitted by the mother and recent husbandry practice have caused hybridization between llama which primarily carry guanaco dna and alpaca to the extent that many of today domestic alpaca are the result of male alpaca bred to female llama this would explain the mtdna consistent with guanaco this situation ha led to attempt to reclassify the alpaca a vicugna pacos breed the alpaca come in two breed suri and huacaya based on their fiber rather than scientific or european classification huacaya alpaca are the most commonly found constituting about of the population the huacaya alpaca is thought to have originated in peru this is due to their thicker fleece which make them more suited to survive in the higher altitude of the andes after being pushed into the highland of peru after the arrival of the spanishsuri alpaca represent a smaller portion of the total alpaca population around they are thought to have been more prevalent in peru since they could be kept at a lower altitude where a thicker fleece wa not needed for harsh weather condition behavior alpaca are social herd animal that live in family group consisting of a territorial alpha male female and their young one alpaca warn the herd about intruder by making sharp noisy inhalation that sound like a bray the herd may attack smaller predator with their front foot and can spit and kick their aggression towards member of the canid family coyote fox dog etc is exploited when alpaca are used a guard llama for guarding sheepalpacas can sometimes be aggressive but they can also be very gentle intelligent and extremely observant for the most part alpaca are very quiet but male alpaca are more energetic when they get involved in fighting with other alpaca when they prey they are cautious but also nervous when they feel any type of threat they can feel threatened when a person or another alpaca come up from behind themalpacas set their own boundary of personal space within their family and group they make a hierarchy in some sense and each alpaca is aware of the dominant animal in each group body language is the key to their communication it help to maintain their order one example of their body communication includes a pose named broadside where their ear are pulled back and they stand sideways this pose is used when male alpaca are defending their territorywhen they are young they tend to follow larger object and to sit near or under them an example of this is a baby alpaca with it mother this can also apply when an alpaca pass by an older alpaca training alpaca are often very trainable and will usually respond to reward most commonly in the form of food they are able to be petted without getting agitated although this is usually only when the animal is not being patted around the head or neck alpaca are usually quite easy to herd even in large group although when being herded it is recommended that the handler approach the animal slowly and quietly not doing this can result in danger for both the animal and the handleralpaca and llama have started showing up in u nursing home and hospital a trained certified therapy animal the mayo clinic say therapy can reduce pain depression anxiety and fatigue this type of animal therapy is growing in popularity and there are several organization throughout the united state that participate spitting not all alpaca spit but all are capable of doing so spit is somewhat euphemistic occasionally the projectile contains only air and a little saliva although alpaca commonly bring up acidic stomach content generally a green grassy mix and project it onto their chosen target spitting is mostly reserved for other alpaca but an alpaca will also occasionally spit at a human spitting can result in what is called sour mouth sour mouth is characterized by a lower lip and a gaping mouthalpacas can spit for several reason a female alpaca spit when she is not interested in a male alpaca typically when she think that she is already impregnated both sex of alpaca keep others away from their food or anything they have their eye on most give a slight warning before spitting by blowing air out and raising their head giving their ear a pinned appearancealpacas can spit up to ten foot if they need to for example if another animal doe not back off the alpaca will throw up it stomach content resulting in a lot of spitsome sign of stress which can lead to their spitting habit include humming a wrinkle under their eye drooling rapid breathing and stomping their foot when alpaca show any sign of interest or alertness they tend to sniff their surroundings watch closely or stand quietly in place and starewhen it come to reproduction they spit because it is a response triggered by the progesterone level being increased which is associated with ovulation hygiene alpaca use a communal dung pile where they do not graze this behaviour tends to limit the spread of internal parasite generally male have much tidier and fewer dung pile than female which tend to stand in a line and all go at once one female approach the dung pile and begin to urinate defecate and the rest of the herd often follows alpaca waste is collected and used a garden fertilizer or even natural fertilizerbecause of their preference for using a dung pile some alpaca have been successfully develop dental hygiene problem which affect their eating and behavior warning sign include protracted chewing while eating or food spilling out of their mouth poor body condition and sunken cheek are also telltale of dental problem sound alpaca make a variety of sound humming when alpaca are born the mother and baby hum constantly they also hum a a sign of distress especially when they are separated from their herd alpaca may also hum when curious happy worried or cautious snorting alpaca snort when another alpaca is invading it space grumbling alpaca grumble to warn each other for example when one is invading another personal space it sound like gurgling clucking similar to a hen cluck alpaca cluck when a mother is concerned for her cria male alpaca cluck to signal friendly behavior screaming their scream are extremely deafening and loud they will scream when they are not handled correctly or when they are being attacked by a potential enemy screeching a cry presumably intended to terrify the opponent this sound is typically used by male alpaca when they are in a fight over dominance when a female screech it is more of a growl when she is angry reproduction female are induced ovulators the act of mating and the presence of semen cause them to ovulate female usually conceive after just one breeding but occasionally do have trouble conceiving artificial insemination is technically difficult expensive and not common but it can be accomplished embryo transfer is more widespread a male is usually ready to mate for the first time between two and three year of age it is not advisable to allow a young female to be bred until she is mature and ha reached of her mature weight a young female before conception is possibly a common cause of uterine infection a the age of maturation varies greatly between individual it is usually recommended that novice breeder wait until female are month of age or older before initiating breedingalpacas can breed at any time but it is more difficult to breed in the winter most breed during autumn or late spring the most popular way to have alpaca mate is pen mating pen mating is when they move both the female and the desired male into a pen another way is paddock mating where one male alpaca is let loose in the paddock with several female alpacasthe gestation period is on an average month and usually result in a single offspring or cria twin are rare occurring about once per delivery cria are generally between and pound and are standing to minute after birth after a female give birth she is generally receptive to breeding again after about two week crias may be weaned through human intervention at about six month old and pound but many breeder prefer to allow the female to decide when to wean her offspring they can be weaned earlier or later depending on their size and emotional maturity the average lifespan of an alpaca is between year and the alpaca on record is year habitat and lifestyle alpaca can be found all over south america they typically live in temperate condition in the mountain with high altitude they are easy to care for since they are not limited to a specific type of environment animal such a flamingo condor spectacled bear mountain lion coyote llama and sheep live near alpaca when they are in their natural habitat population alpaca are native to peru but can be found throughout the globe it currently ha the largest population with over half the world animal the population declined drastically after the spanish conquistador invaded the andes mountain in after which of the animal were destroyed the spanish also brought with them disease that were fatal to alpacaseuropean conquest forced the animal to move higher into the mountain which remained there permanently although alpaca had almost been wiped out completely they were rediscovered sometime during the century by european after finding us for them the animal became important to society during the industrial revolution diet alpaca chew their food which end up being mixed with their cud and saliva and then they swallow it alpaca usually eat of it body weight for normal growth they mainly need pasture grass hay or silage but some may also need supplemental energy and protein food and they will also normally try to chew on almost anything eg empty bottle most alpaca rancher rotate their feeding ground so the grass can regrow and fecal parasite may die before reusing the area pasture grass is a great source of protein when season change the grass loses or gain more protein for example in the spring the pasture grass ha about protein while in the summer it only ha they need more energy supplement in the winter to produce body heat and warmth they get their fiber from hay or from long stem which provides them with vitamin e green grass contains vitamin a and e alpaca can eat natural unfertilized grass however rancher can also supplement grass with grass hay to provide selenium and other necessary vitamin rancher will feed their domestic alpaca a daily dose of grain to provide additional nutrient that are not fully obtained from their primary diet alpaca may obtain the necessary vitamin in their native grazing range digestion alpaca like other camelids have a stomach combined with chewing cud this system allows maximum extraction of nutrient from forage alpaca are not ruminant or modified ruminant a there are many difference between the anatomy and physiology of a camelid and a ruminant stomachalpacas will chew their food in a figure eight motion swallow the food and then pas it into one of the stomach chamber the first and second chamber called and are anaerobic fermentation chamber where the fermentation process begin the alpaca will further absorb nutrient and water in the first part of the third chamber the end of the third chamber called is where the stomach secretes acid to digest food and is the likely place where an alpaca will have ulcer if stressed poisonous plant many plant are poisonous to the alpaca including the bracken fern madagascar ragwort oleander and some azalea in common with similar livestock others include acorn african rue agave amaryllis autumn crocus bear grass broom snakeweed buckwheat ragweed buttercup calla lily orange tree foliage carnation castor bean and many others fiber alpaca fleece is a lustrous and silky natural fiber while similar to sheep wool it is warmer not prickly and bear no lanolin which make it hypoallergenic without lanolin it doe not repel water it is also soft and luxurious in physical structure alpaca fiber is somewhat akin to hair being very glossy the preparing carding spinning weaving and finishing process of alpaca is very similar to the process used for wool alpaca fiber is also and meet the u consumer product safety commission standardsalpacas are typically sheared once per year in the spring each shearing produce approximately to kilogram to pound of fiber per alpaca an adult alpaca might produce to kilogram to ounce of fiber a well a to kilogram to ounce of and fiber the quality of alpaca fiber is determined by how crimpy it is typically the greater the number of small fold in the fiber the greater the quality price alpaca were the subject of a speculative bubble between their introduction to north america in and the early century the price for american alpaca ranged from u for a castrated male gelding to u for the highest in the world depending on breeding history sex and color in researcher warned that the higher price sought for alpaca breeding stock were largely speculative and not supported by market fundamental given the low inherent return per head from the main end product alpaca fiber and price into the per head rather than would be required for a commercially viable fiber production herdmarketed a the investment you can hug in television commercial by the alpaca owner and breeder association the market for alpaca wa almost entirely dependent on breeding and selling animal to new buyer a classic sign of speculative bubble in livestock the bubble burst in with the price of alpaca breeding stock dropping by thousand of dollar each year thereafter many farmer found themselves unable to sell animal for any price or even give them awayit is possible to raise up to alpaca per hectare alpaca per acre a they have a designated area for waste product and keep their eating area away from their waste area however this ratio differs from country to country and is highly dependent on the quality of pasture available in many desert location it is generally only possible to run one to three animal per acre due to lack of suitable vegetation fiber quality is the primary variant in the price achieved for alpaca wool in australia it is common to classify the fiber by the thickness of the individual hair and by the amount of vegetable matter contained in the supplied shearing livestock alpaca need to eat of body weight per day so about two kg lb bale of grass hay per month per animal when formulating a proper diet for alpaca water and hay analysis should be performed to determine the proper vitamin and mineral supplementation program two option are to provide free choice powder or feed a specially formulated ration indigenous to the highest region of the andes this harsh environment ha created an extremely hardy animal so only minimal housing and predator fencing are needed the alpaca stomach allow for extremely efficient digestion there are no viable seed in the manure because alpaca prefer to only eat tender plant leaf and will not consume thick plant stem therefore alpaca manure doe not need composting to enrich pasture or ornamental landscaping nail and teeth trimming are needed every six to twelve month along with annual shearing similar to ruminant such a cattle and sheep alpaca have only lower teeth at the front of their mouth therefore they do not pull the grass up by the root rotating pasture is still important though a alpaca have a tendency to regraze an area repeatedly alpaca are animal they do not need to be slaughtered to reap their product and their fiber is a renewable resource that grows yearly cultural presence alpaca are closely tied to cultural practice for andeans people prior to colonization the image of the alpaca wa used in ritual and in their religious practice since the people in the region depended heavily on these animal for their sustenance the alpaca wa seen a a gift from pachamama alpaca were used for their meat fiber for clothing and art and their image in the form of conopas conopas take their appearance from the suri alpaca with long lock flanking their side and bang covering the eye and a depression on the back this depression is used in ritual practice usually filled with coca leaf and fat from alpaca and lama to bring fertility and luck while their use wa prevalent before colonization the attempt to convert the andean people to catholicism led to the acquisition of more than conopas in lima alone the origin of alpaca is depicted in legend the legend state they came to be in the world after a goddess fell in love with a man the goddess father only allowed her to be with her lover if he cared for her herd of alpaca on top of caring for the herd he wa to always carry a small animal for his entire life a the goddess came into our world the alpaca followed her everything wa fine until the man set the small animal down and the goddess fled back to her home on her way back home the man attempted to stop her and her herd from fleeing while he wa not able to stop her from returning he wa able to stop a few alpaca from returning these alpaca who did not make it back are said to be seen today in the swampy land in the andes waiting for the end of the world so they may return to their goddess see also alpaca fiber
