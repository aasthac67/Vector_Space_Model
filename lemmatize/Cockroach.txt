cockroach or roach are insect of the order blattodea which also includes termite about cockroach specie out of are associated with human habitat about five specie are well known a pest the cockroach are an ancient group dating back at least a far a the carboniferous period some million year ago those early ancestor however lacked the internal ovipositor of modern roach cockroach are somewhat generalized insect without special adaptation like the sucking mouthpart of aphid and other true bug they have chewing mouthpart and are likely among the most primitive of living neopteran insect they are common and hardy insect and can tolerate a wide range of environment from arctic cold to tropical heat tropical cockroach are often much bigger than temperate specie and contrary to popular belief extinct cockroach relative blattoptera and such a the carboniferous archimylacris and the permian apthoroblattina were not a large a the biggest modern specie some specie such a the gregarious german cockroach have an elaborate social structure involving common shelter social dependence information transfer and kin recognition cockroach have appeared in human culture since classical antiquity they are popularly depicted a dirty pest though the great majority of specie are inoffensive and live in a wide range of habitat around the world taxonomy and evolution cockroach are member of the order blattodea which includes the termite a group of insect once thought to be separate from cockroach currently specie and over genus are described worldwide the name cockroach come from the spanish word for cockroach cucaracha transformed by english folk etymology into cock and roach the scientific name derives from the latin blatta an insect that shuns the light which in classical latin wa applied not only to cockroach but also to mantidshistorically the name blattaria wa used largely interchangeably with the name blattodea but whilst the former name wa used to refer to cockroach exclusively the latter also includes the termite the current catalogue of world cockroach specie us the name blattodea for the group another name blattoptera is also sometimes used to refer to extinct cockroach relative the earliest fossil blattopterans or roachids are from the carboniferous period million year ago a are fossil roachoid nymphssince the century scientist believed that cockroach were an ancient group of insect that had a devonian origin according to one hypothesis fossil roachoids that lived during that time differ from modern cockroach in that they had long external ovipositor and are the ancestor of mantis a well a modern cockroach a the body hind wing and mouthpart are not preserved in fossil frequently the relationship of these roachoids and modern cockroach remains disputed the first fossil of modern cockroach with internal ovipositor appeared in the early cretaceous a recent phylogenetic analysis suggests that cockroach originated at least in the jurassicthe evolutionary relationship of the blattodea cockroach and termite shown in the cladogram are based on eggleton beccaloni and inward the cockroach family lamproblattidae and tryonicidae are not shown but are placed within the superfamily blattoidea the cockroach family corydiidae and ectobiidae were previously known a the polyphagidae and blattellidae termite were previously regarded a a separate order isoptera to cockroach however recent genetic evidence strongly suggests that they evolved directly from cockroach and many author now place them a an epifamily of blattodea this evidence supported a hypothesis suggested in that termite are closely related to the cockroach genus cryptocercus this hypothesis wa originally based on similarity of the symbiotic gut flagellate in termite regarded a living fossil and cockroach additional evidence emerged when f a mckittrick noted similar morphological characteristic between some termite and cockroach nymph the similarity among these cockroach and termite have led some scientist to reclassify termite a a single family the termitidae within the order blattodea other scientist have taken a more conservative approach proposing to retain the termite a the termitoidae an epifamily within the order such a measure preserve the classification of termite at family level and below description most specie of cockroach are about the size of a thumbnail but several specie are bigger the world heaviest cockroach is the australian giant burrowing cockroach macropanesthia rhinoceros which can reach centimetre in in length and weigh more than gram oz comparable in size is the central american giant cockroach blaberus giganteus the longest cockroach specie is megaloblatta longipennis which can reach mm in in length and mm in across a central and south american specie megaloblatta blaberoides ha the largest wingspan of up to mm in cockroach are generalized insect with few special adaptation and may be among the most primitive living neopteran insect they have a relatively small head and a broad flattened body and most specie are to dark brown they have large compound eye two ocellus and long flexible antenna the mouthpart are on the underside of the head and include generalized chewing mandible salivary gland and various touch and taste receptorsthe body is divided into a thorax of three segment and a abdomen the external surface ha a tough exoskeleton which contains calcium carbonate and protects the inner organ and provides attachment to muscle it is coated with wax to repel water the wing are attached to the second and third thoracic segment the tegmina or first pair of wing are tough and protective lying a a shield on top of the membranous hind wing which are used in flight all four wing have branching longitudinal vein and multiple three pair of leg are sturdy with large coxa and five claw each they are attached to each of the three thoracic segment the front leg are the shortest and the hind leg the longest providing the main propulsive power when the insect run the spine on the leg were earlier considered to be sensory but observation of the insect gait on sand and wire mesh have demonstrated that they help in locomotion on difficult terrain the structure have been used a inspiration for robotic legsthe abdomen ha ten segment each with a pair of spiracle for respiration segment ten bear a pair of cerci a pair of anal style the anus and the external genitalia male have an aedeagus through which they secrete sperm during copulation and female have spermatheca for storing sperm and an ovipositor through which the ootheca are laid distribution and habitat cockroach are abundant throughout the world and live in a wide range of environment especially in the tropic and subtropics cockroach can withstand extremely low temperature allowing them to live in the arctic some specie are capable of surviving temperature of by manufacturing an antifreeze made out of glycerol in north america specie separated into five family are found throughout the continent specie are found in australia only about four widespread specie are commonly regarded a pestscockroaches occupy a wide range of habitat many live in leaf litter among the stem of matted vegetation in rotting wood in hole in stump in cavity under bark under log pile and among debris some live in arid region and have developed mechanism to survive without access to water source others are aquatic living near the surface of water body including bromeliad phytotelmata and diving to forage for food most of these respire by piercing the water surface with the tip of the abdomen which act a a snorkel but some carry a bubble of air under their thoracic shield when they submerge others live in the forest canopy where they may be one of the main type of invertebrate present here they may hide during the day in crevice among dead leaf in bird and insect nest or among epiphyte emerging at night to feed behavior cockroach are social insect a large number of specie are either gregarious or inclined to aggregate and a slightly smaller number exhibit parental care it used to be thought that cockroach aggregated because they were reacting to environmental cue but it is now believed that pheromone are involved in these behavior some specie secrete these in their feces with gut microbial symbionts being involved while others use gland located on their mandible pheromone produced by the cuticle may enable cockroach to distinguish between different population of cockroach by odor the behavior involved have been studied in only a few specie but german cockroach leave fecal trail with an odor gradient other cockroach follow such trail to discover source of food and water and where other cockroach are hiding thus cockroach have emergent behavior in which group or swarm behavior emerges from a simple set of individual interactionsdaily rhythm may also be regulated by a complex set of hormonal control of which only a small subset have been understood in the role of one of these protein pigment dispersing factor pdf wa isolated and found to be a key mediator in the circadian rhythm of the cockroachpest specie adapt readily to a variety of environment but prefer warm condition found within building many tropical specie prefer even warmer environment cockroach are mainly nocturnal and run away when exposed to light an exception to this is the asian cockroach which fly mostly at night but is attracted to brightly lit surface and pale color collective gregarious cockroach display collective when choosing food source when a sufficient number of individual a quorum exploit a food source this signal to newcomer cockroach that they should stay there longer rather than leave for elsewhere other mathematical model have been developed to explain aggregation dynamic and conspecific recognitioncooperation and competition are balanced in cockroach group behaviorcockroaches appear to use just two piece of information to decide where to go namely how dark it is and how many other cockroach there are a study used robot that seem real to the roach to demonstrate that once there are enough insect in a place to form a critical mass the roach accepted the collective decision on where to hide even if this wa an unusually lit place social behavior when reared in isolation german cockroach show behavior that is different from behavior when reared in a group in one study isolated cockroach were le likely to leave their shelter and explore spent le time eating interacted le with conspecific when exposed to them and took longer to recognize receptive female because these change occurred in many context the author suggested them a constituting a behavioral syndrome these effect might have been due either to reduced metabolic and developmental rate in isolated individual or the fact that the isolated individual had not had a training period to learn about what others were like via their antennaeindividual american cockroach appear to have consistently different personality regarding how they seek shelter in addition group personality is not simply the sum of individual choice but reflects conformity and collective gregarious german and american cockroach have elaborate social structure chemical signalling and social herd characteristic lihoreau and his fellow researcher stated the social biology of domiciliary cockroach can be characterized by a common shelter overlapping generation of group equal reproductive potential of group member an absence of task specialization high level of social dependence central place foraging social information transfer kin recognition and a structure sound some specie make a hissing noise while other cockroach make a chirping noise the madagascar hissing cockroach produce it sound through the modified spiracle on the fourth abdominal segment several different hiss are produced including disturbance sound produced by adult and larger nymph and aggressive courtship and copulatory sound produced by adult maleshenschoutedenia epilamproides ha a stridulatory organ between it thorax and abdomen but the purpose of the sound produced is unclearseveral australian specie practice acoustic and vibration behavior a an aspect of courtship they have been observed producing hiss and whistle from air forced through the spiracle furthermore in the presence of a potential mate some cockroach tap the substrate in a rhythmic repetitive manner acoustic signal may be of greater prevalence amongst perching specie particularly those that live on low vegetation in australia tropic biology digestive tract cockroach are generally omnivorous the american cockroach periplaneta americana for example feed on a great variety of foodstuff including bread fruit leather starch in book binding paper glue skin flake hair dead insect and soiled clothing many specie of cockroach harbor in their gut symbiotic protozoan and bacteria which are able to digest cellulose in many specie these symbionts may be essential if the insect is to utilize cellulose however some specie secrete cellulase in their saliva and the cockroach panesthia cribrata is able to survive indefinitely on a diet of crystallized cellulose while being free of microorganismsthe similarity of these symbionts in the genus cryptocercus to those in termite are such that these cockroach have been suggested to be more closely related to termite than to other cockroach and current research strongly support this hypothesis about their relationship all specie studied so far carry the obligate mutualistic endosymbiont bacterium blattabacterium with the exception of nocticola australiensise an australian specie without eye pigment or wing which recent genetic study indicate is a very primitive cockroach it had previously been thought that all five family of cockroach were descended from a common ancestor that wa infected with b cuenoti it may be that n australiensise subsequently lost it symbionts or alternatively this hypothesis will need to be trachea and breathing like other insect cockroach breathe through a system of tube called trachea which are attached to opening called spiracle on all body segment when the carbon dioxide level in the insect rise high enough valve on the spiracle open and carbon dioxide diffuses out and oxygen diffuses in the tracheal system branch repeatedly the finest tracheoles bringing air directly to each cell allowing gaseous exchange to take placewhile cockroach do not have lung a do vertebrate and can continue to respire if their head are removed in some very large specie the body musculature may contract rhythmically to forcibly move air in and out of the spiracle this may be considered a form of breathing reproduction cockroach use pheromone to attract mate and the male practice courtship ritual such a posturing and stridulation like many insect cockroach mate facing away from each other with their genitalia in contact and copulation can be prolonged a few specie are known to be parthenogenetic reproducing without the need for malesfemale cockroach are sometimes seen carrying egg case on the end of their abdomen the german cockroach hold about to long thin egg in a case called an ootheca she drop the capsule prior to hatching though live birth do occur in rare instance the egg capsule may take more than five hour to lay and is initially bright white in color the egg are hatched from the combined pressure of the hatchling gulping air the hatchling are initially bright white nymph and continue inflating themselves with air becoming harder and darker within about four hour their transient white stage while hatching and later while molting ha led to claim of albino cockroach development from egg to adult take three to four month cockroach live up to a year and the female may produce up to eight egg case in a lifetime in favorable condition she can produce to offspring other specie of cockroach however can produce far more egg in some case a female need to be impregnated only once to be able to lay egg for the rest of her lifethe female usually attache the egg case to a substrate insert it into a suitably protective crevice or carry it about until just before the egg hatch some specie however are ovoviviparous keeping the egg inside their body with or without an egg case until they hatch at least one genus diploptera is fully viviparouscockroaches have incomplete metamorphosis meaning that the nymph are generally similar to the adult except for undeveloped wing and genitalia development is generally slow and may take a few month to over a year the adult are also and have survived for a much a four year in the laboratory hardiness cockroach are among the hardiest insect some specie are capable of remaining active for a month without food and are able to survive on limited resource such a the glue from the back of postage stamp some can go without air for minute japanese cockroach periplaneta japonica nymph which hibernate in cold winter have survived twelve hour at to to in laboratory experimentsexperiments on decapitated specimen of several specie of cockroach found a variety of behavioral functionality remained including shock avoidance and escape behavior although many insect other than cockroach are also able to survive decapitation and popular claim of the longevity of headless cockroach do not appear to be based on published research the severed head is able to survive and wave it antenna for several hour or longer when refrigerated and given nutrientsit is popularly suggested that cockroach will inherit the earth if humanity destroys itself in a nuclear war cockroach do indeed have a much higher radiation resistance than vertebrate with the lethal dose perhaps six to time that for human however they are not exceptionally compared to other insect such a the fruit flythe cockroach ability to withstand radiation better than human being can be explained through the cell cycle cell are most vulnerable to the effect of radiation when they are dividing a cockroach cell divide only once each time it molt which is weekly at most in a juvenile roach since not all cockroach would be molting at the same time many would be unaffected by an acute burst of radiation although lingering radioactive fallout would still be harmful relationship with human in research and education because of their ease of rearing and resilience cockroach have been used a insect model in the laboratory particularly in the field of neurobiology reproductive physiology and social behavior the cockroach is a convenient insect to study a it is large and simple to raise in a laboratory environment this make it suitable both for research and for school and undergraduate biology study it can be used in experiment on topic such a learning sexual pheromone spatial orientation aggression activity rhythm and the biological clock and behavioral ecology research conducted in suggests that human fear cockroach the most even more than mosquito due to an evolutionary aversion a pest the blattodea include some thirty specie of cockroach associated with human these specie are atypical of the thousand of specie in the order they feed on human and pet food and can leave an offensive odor they can passively transport pathogenic microbe on their body surface particularly in environment such a hospital cockroach are linked with allergic reaction in human one of the protein that trigger allergic reaction is tropomyosin these allergen are also linked with asthma about of asthma patient in chicago are also sensitive to cockroach allergen study similar to this have been done globally and all the result are similar some specie of cockroach can live for up to a month without food so just because no cockroach are visible in a home doe not mean that they are not there approximately of home with no visible sign of cockroach have detectable cockroach allergen in dustcockroaches can burrow into human ear causing pain and hearing loss they may be removed with forceps possibly after first drowning with olive oil control many remedy have been tried in the search for control of the major pest specie of cockroach which are resilient and household chemical like sodium bicarbonate baking soda have been suggested without evidence for their effectiveness garden herb including bay catnip mint cucumber and garlic have been proposed a repellent poisoned bait containing hydramethylnon or fipronil and boric acid powder is effective on adult bait with egg killer are also quite effective at reducing the cockroach population alternatively insecticide containing deltamethrin or pyrethrin are very effective in singapore and malaysia taxi driver use pandan leaf to repel cockroach in their vehiclessome parasite and predator are effective for biological control of cockroach parasitoidal wasp such a ampulex wasp sting nerve ganglion in the cockroach thorax causing temporary paralysis and allowing the wasp to deliver an incapacitating sting into the cockroach brain the wasp clip the antenna with it mandible and drink some hemolymph before dragging the prey to a burrow where an egg rarely two is laid on it the wasp larva feed on the subdued living cockroach another wasp considered to be a promising candidate for biological control is the ensign wasp evania appendigaster which attack cockroach oothecae to lay a single egg inside ongoing research is still developing technology allowing for these wasp for application release widow spider commonly prey on cockroach though their venomous bite introduces it own problem for human and pet cockroach can be trapped in a deep jar baited with food inside placed so that cockroach can reach the opening for example with a ramp of card or twig on the outside an inch or so of water or stale beer by itself a cockroach attractant in the jar can be used to drown any insect thus captured the method work well with the american cockroach but le so with the german cockroacha study conducted by scientist at purdue university concluded that the most common cockroach in the u australia and europe were able to develop a cross resistance to multiple type of pesticide this contradicted previous understanding that the animal can develop resistance against one pesticide at a time the scientist suggested that cockroach will no longer be easily controlled using a diverse spectrum of chemical pesticide and that a mix of other mean such a trap and better sanitation will need to be employed a food although considered disgusting in western culture cockroach are eaten in many place around the world whereas household pest cockroach may carry bacteria and virus cockroach bred under laboratory condition can be used to prepare nutritious food in mexico and thailand the head and leg are removed and the remainder may be boiled sauteed grilled dried or diced in china cockroach have become popular a medicine and cockroach farming is rising with over farmsthe cockroach are fried twice in a wok of hot oil which make them crispy with soft innards that are like cottage cheese fried cockroach are ground and sold a pill for stomach heart and liver disease a cockroach recipe from formosa taiwan specifies salting and frying cockroach after removing the head and entrails in traditional and homeopathic medicine in china cockroach are raised in large quantity for medicinal purposestwo specie of cockroach were used in homeopathic medicine in the century conservation while a small minority of cockroach are associated with human habitat and viewed a repugnant by many people a few specie are of conservation concern the lord howe island cockroach panesthia lata is listed a endangered by the new south wale scientific committee but the cockroach may be extinct on lord howe island itself the introduction of rat the spread of rhodes grass chloris gayana and fire are possible reason for their scarcity two specie are currently listed a endangered and critically endangered by the iucn red list delosia ornata and nocticola gerlachi both cockroach have a restricted distribution and are threatened by habitat loss and rising sea level only delosia ornata adult and nymph are known to exist and these are threatened by a hotel development no action ha been taken to save the two cockroach specie but protecting their natural habitat may prevent their extinction in the former soviet union cockroach population have been declining at an alarming rate this may be exaggerated or the phenomenon may be temporary or cyclic one specie of roach simandoa conserfariam is considered extinct in the wild cultural depiction cockroach were known and considered repellent but medicinally useful in classical time an insect named in greek silphe silphe ha been identified with the cockroach though the scientific name silpha refers to a genus of carrion beetle it is mentioned by aristotle saying that it shed it skin it is described a in aristophanes play peace euenus called it a pest of book collection being destructive in his analect virgil named the cockroach lucifuga one that avoids light pliny the elder recorded the use of blatta in various medicine he describes the insect a disgusting and a seeking out dark corner to avoid the light dioscorides recorded the use of the silphe ground up with oil a a remedy for earachelafcadio hearn asserted that for tetanus cockroach tea is given i do not know how many cockroach go to make up the cup but i find that faith in this remedy is strong among many of the american population of new orleans a poultice of boiled cockroach is placed over the wound he add that cockroach are eaten fried with garlic for indigestionseveral cockroach specie such a blaptica dubia are raised a food for insectivorous pet a few cockroach specie are raised a pet most commonly the giant madagascar hissing cockroach gromphadorhina portentosa whilst the hissing cockroach may be the most commonly kept specie there are many specie that are kept by cockroach enthusiast there is even a specialist society the blattodea culture group bcg which wa a thriving organisation for about year although now appears to be dormant the bcg provided a source of literature for people interested in rearing cockroach which wa otherwise limited to either scientific paper or general insect book or book covering a variety of exotic pet in the absence of an inclusive book one member published introduction to rearing cockroach which still appears to be the only book dedicated to rearing cockroachescockroaches have been used for space test a cockroach given the name nadezhda wa sent into space by russian scientist a part of a mission during which she mated and later became the first terrestrial animal to produce offspring that had been conceived in spacebecause of their long association with human cockroach are frequently referred to in popular culture in western culture cockroach are often depicted a dirty pest in a journal peter osbeck noted that cockroach were frequently seen and found their way to the bakery after the sailing ship gothenburg ran aground and wa destroyed by rocksdonald harington satirical novel the cockroach
