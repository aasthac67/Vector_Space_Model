an eel is any fish belonging to the order anguilliformes which consists of eight suborder family genus and about specie eel undergo considerable development from the early larval stage to the eventual adult stage and most are predator the term eel is also used for some other fish such a electric eel genus electrophorus spiny eel family mastacembelidae and spiny eel family notacanthidae these other clade however evolved their shape independently from the true eel description eel are elongated fish ranging in length from cm in in the eel monognathus ahlstromi to m ft in the slender giant moray adult range in weight from g oz to well over kg lb they posse no pelvic fin and many specie also lack pectoral fin the dorsal and anal fin are fused with the caudal fin forming a single ribbon running along much of the length of the animal eel swim by generating body wave which travel the length of their body they can swim backwards by reversing the direction of the wavemost eel live in the shallow water of the ocean and burrow into sand mud or amongst rock a majority of eel specie are nocturnal thus are rarely seen sometimes they are seen living together in hole or eel pit some specie of eel also live in deeper water on the continental shelf and over the slope deep a m ft only member of the anguilla regularly inhabit fresh water but they too return to the sea to breedthe heaviest true eel is the european conger the maximum size of this specie ha been reported a reaching a length of m ft and a weight of kg lb other eel are longer but do not weigh a much such a the slender giant moray which reach m ft the eel is referred to a the devil of the sea lifecycle eel begin life a flat and transparent larva called leptocephalus eel larva drift in the surface water of the sea feeding on marine snow small particle that float in the water eel larva then metamorphose into glass eel and then become elver before finally seeking out their juvenile and adult habitat many eel remain in the sea throughout their life but freshwater elver of eel in the family anguillidae travel upstream and are forced to climb up obstruction such a weir dam wall and natural waterfall lady colin campbell

barrier enabling the elver to ascend classification this classification follows fishbase in dividing the eel into family additional family included in other classification notably itis and systema
