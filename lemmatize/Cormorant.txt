phalacrocoracidae is a family of approximately specie of aquatic bird commonly known a cormorant and shag several different classification of the family have been proposed recently and the number of genus is disputed the great cormorant p carbo and the common shag p aristotelis are the only two specie of the family commonly encountered on the british isle and cormorant and shag appellation have been later assigned to different specie in the family somewhat haphazardly cormorant and shag are bird with body weight in the range of kilogram lb and wing span of centimetre in the majority of specie have dark feather the bill is long thin and hooked their foot have webbing between all four toe all specie are catching the prey by diving from the surface they are excellent diver and under water they propel themselves with their foot with help from their wing some cormorant specie have been found to dive a deep a metre ft they have relatively short wing due to their need for economical movement underwater and consequently have the highest flight cost of any flying birdcormorants nest in colony around the shore on tree islet or cliff they are coastal rather than oceanic bird and some have colonised inland water indeed the original ancestor of cormorant seems to have been a bird they range around the world except for the central pacific island name no consistent distinction exists between cormorant and shag the name and were originally the common name of the two specie of the family found in great britain phalacrocorax carbo now referred to by ornithologist a the great cormorant and p aristotelis the european shag shag refers to the bird crest which the british form of the great cormorant lack a other specie were encountered by sailor and explorer elsewhere in the world some were called cormorant and some shag depending on whether they had crest or not sometimes the same specie is called a cormorant in one part of the world and a shag in another eg the great cormorant is called the black shag in new zealand the bird found in australasia have a crest that is absent in european member of the specie van tet proposed to divide the family into two genus and attach the name cormorant to one and shag to the other but this fly in the face of common usage and ha not been widely adopted the scientific genus name is latinised ancient greek from phalakros phalakros bald and korax korax raven this is often thought to refer to the creamy white patch on the cheek of adult great cormorant or the ornamental white head plume prominent in mediterranean bird of this specie but is certainly not a unifying characteristic of cormorant cormorant is a contraction derived either directly from latin corvus marinus sea raven or through brythonic celtic cormoran is the cornish name of the sea giant in the tale of jack the giant killer indeed sea raven or analogous term were the usual term for cormorant in germanic language until after the middle age the french explorer andre thevet commented in the beak is similar to that of a cormorant or other corvid which demonstrates that the erroneous belief that the bird were related to raven lasted at least to the century description cormorant and shag are seabird they range in size from the pygmy cormorant phalacrocorax pygmaeus at a little a cm in and g oz to the flightless cormorant phalacrocorax harrisi at a maximum size cm in and kg lb the recently extinct spectacled cormorant phalacrocorax perspicillatus wa rather larger at an average size of kg lb the majority including nearly all northern hemisphere specie have mainly dark plumage but some southern hemisphere specie are black and white and a few eg the spotted shag of new zealand are quite colourful many specie have area of coloured skin on the face the lore and the gular skin which can be bright blue orange red or yellow typically becoming more brightly coloured in the breeding season the bill is long thin and sharply hooked their foot have webbing between all four toe a in their relative habitat they are coastal rather than oceanic bird and some have colonised inland water indeed the original ancestor of cormorant seems to have been a bird judging from the habitat of the most ancient lineage they range around the world except for the central pacific island behaviour all are dining on small eel fish and even water snake they dive from the surface though many specie make a characteristic a they dive presumably to give themselves a more streamlined entry into the water under water they propel themselves with their foot though some also propel themselves with their wing see the picture commentary and existing reference video some cormorant specie have been found using depth gauge to dive to depth of a much a metre ft after fishing cormorant go ashore and are frequently seen holding their wing out in the sun all cormorant have preen gland secretion that are used ostensibly to keep the feather waterproof some source state that cormorant have waterproof feather while others say that they have feather still others suggest that the outer plumage absorbs water but doe not permit it to penetrate the layer of air next to the skin the wing drying action is seen even in the flightless cormorant but commonly in the antarctic shag and cormorant alternate function suggested for the posture include that it aid thermoregulation or digestion balance the bird or indicates presence of fish a detailed study of the great cormorant concludes that it is without doubt to dry the plumagecormorants are colonial nester using tree rocky islet or cliff the egg are a colour there is usually one brood a year parent regurgitate food to feed their young whose deep ungainly bill show a greater resemblance to those of the pelican to which they are related than is obvious in the adult taxonomy the cormorant are a group traditionally placed within the pelecaniformes or in the taxonomy the expanded ciconiiformes this latter group is certainly not a natural one and even after the tropicbird have been recognised a quite distinct the remaining pelecaniformes seem not to be entirely monophyletic their relationship and delimitation apart from being part of a higher waterfowl clade which is similar but not identical to sibley and ahlquist remain mostly unresolved notwithstanding all evidence agrees that the cormorant and shag are closer to the darter and sulidae gannet and booby and perhaps the pelican or even penguin than to all other living birdsin recent year three preferred treatment of the cormorant family have emerged either to leave all living cormorant in a single genus phalacrocorax or to split off a few specie such a the imperial shag complex in leucocarbo and perhaps the flightless cormorant alternatively the genus may be disassembled altogether and in the most extreme case be reduced to the great and japanese cormorantspending a thorough review of the recent and prehistoric cormorant the approach is followed here for three reason first it is preferable to tentatively assigning genus without a robust hypothesis second it make it easier to deal with the fossil form the systematic treatment of which ha been no le controversial than that of living cormorant and shag third this scheme is also used by the iucn making it easier to incorporate data on status and conservation in accordance with the treatment there the imperial shag complex is here left unsplit a well but the king shag complex ha been the cormorant and the darter have a unique bone on the back of the top of the skull known a the o nuchale or occipital style which wa called a xiphoid process in early literature this bony projection provides anchorage for the muscle that increase the force with which the lower mandible is closed this bone and the highly developed muscle over it the m adductor mandibulae caput nuchale are unique to the family phalacrocoracidae and anhingidaeseveral evolutionary group are still recognizable however combining the available evidence suggests that there ha also been a great deal of convergent evolution for example the cliff shag are a convergent paraphyletic group the proposed division into phalacrocorax sensu stricto or subfamily phalacrocoracinae cormorant and leucocarbo sensu lato or leucocarboninae shag doe indeed have some degree of merit the resolution provided by the mtdna rrna and atpase subunit six and eight sequence data is not sufficient to properly resolve several group to satisfaction in addition many specie remain unsampled the fossil record ha not been integrated in the data and the effect of hybridisation known in some pacific specie especially on the dna sequence data are unstudied list of genus the family contains three genus for detail see the article list of cormorant specie microcarbo specie phalacrocorax specie including one extinct in century leucocarbo specie evolution and fossil record cormorant seem to be a very ancient group with similar ancestor reaching back to the time of the dinosaur in fact the earliest known modern bird gansu yumenensis had essentially the same structure the detail of the evolution of the cormorant are mostly unknown even the technique of using the distribution and relationship of a specie to figure out where it came from biogeography usually very informative doe not give very specific data for this probably rather ancient and widespread group however the closest living relative of the cormorant and shag are the other family of the suborder and gannet and have a primarily gondwanan distribution hence at least the modern diversity of sulae probably originated in the southern hemisphere while the leucocarbonines are almost certainly of southern pacific even the antarctic which at the time when cormorant evolved wa not yet that can be said about the phalacrocoracines is that they are most diverse in the region bordering the indian ocean but generally occur over a large area similarly the origin of the family is shrouded in uncertainty some late cretaceous fossil have been proposed to belong with the phalacrocoracidae a scapula from the boundary about mya million year ago wa found in the nemegt formation in mongolia it is now in the pin collection it is from a bird roughly the size of a spectacled cormorant and quite similar to the corresponding bone in phalacrocorax a maastrichtian late cretaceous c mya right femur amnh fr from the lance formation near lance creek wyoming is sometimes suggested to be the record of the phalacrocoracidae this wa from a rather smaller bird about the size of a cormorantas the early oligocene sula ronzoni can not be assigned to any of the suloid and shag darter and gannet and certainty the best interpretation is that the phalacrocoracidae diverged from their closest ancestor in the early oligocene perhaps some million year ago and that the cretaceous fossil represent ancestral suloids pelecaniforms or higher waterbird at least the last lineage is generally believed to have been already distinct and undergoing evolutionary radiation at the end of the cretaceous what can be said with near certainty is that amnh fr is from a diving bird that used it foot for underwater locomotion a this is liable to result in some degree of convergent evolution and the bone is missing indisputable neornithine feature it is not entirely certain that the bone is correctly referred to this groupduring the late paleogene when the family presumably originated much of eurasia wa covered by shallow sea a the indian plate finally attached to the mainland lacking a detailed study it may well be that the first modern cormorant were small specie from eastern or southern asia possibly living in freshwater habitat that dispersed due to tectonic event such a scenario would account for the distribution of cormorant and shag and is not contradicted by the fossil record a remarked above a thorough review of the problem is not yet available two distinct genus of prehistoric cormorant are widely accepted today if phalacrocorax is used for all living specie limicorallus indricotherium middle oligocene of kazakhstan nectornis late miocene of central europe middle miocene of turkey includes oligocorax miocaenusthe proposed genus oligocorax appears to be paraphyletic the european specie have been separated in nectornis and the north american one are placed in the expanded phalacrocorax a late oligocene fossil cormorant foot from enspel germany sometimes placed herein would then be referable to nectornis if it prof not to be too distinct all these early european specie might belong to the basal group of microcormorants a they conform with them in size and seem to have inhabited the same habitat subtropical coastal or inland water limicorallus meanwhile wa initially believed to be a rail or a dabbling duck by some there are also undescribed remains of apparent cormorant from the quercy phosphorites of quercy france dating to some time between the late eocene and the some other paleogene remains are sometimes assigned to the phalacrocoracidae but these bird seem quite intermediate between cormorant and darter and lack clear autapomorphies of either thus they may be quite basal member of the palacrocoracoidea the taxon in question are piscator late eocene

archaeological evidence suggests that cormorant fishing wa practiced in ancient egypt peru korea and india but the strongest tradition ha remained in china and japan where it reached level in some area in japan cormorant fishing is called ukai Ti Si  traditional form of ukai can be seen on the nagara river in the city of gifu gifu prefecture where cormorant fishing ha continued uninterrupted for year or in the city of inuyama aichi in guilin guangxi cormorant are famous for fishing on the shallow li river in gifu the japanese cormorant p capillatus is used chinese fisherman often employ great cormorant p carbo in europe a similar practice wa also used on doiran lake in the region of macedoniain a common technique a snare is tied near the base of the bird throat which allows the bird only to swallow small fish when the bird capture and try to swallow a large fish the fish is caught in the bird throat when the bird return to the fisherman raft the fisherman help the bird to remove the fish from it throat the method is not a common today since more efficient method of catching fish have been developed but is still practiced a a cultural tradition in folklore literature and art cormorant feature in heraldry and medieval ornamentation usually in their pose which wa seen a representing the christian cross and symbolizing nobility and sacrifice for john milton in paradise lost the cormorant symbolizes greed perched atop the tree of life satan took the form of a cormorant a he spied on adam and eve during his first intrusion into edenin some scandinavian area they are considered good omen in particular in norwegian tradition spirit of those lost at sea come to visit their loved one disguised a cormorant for example the norwegian municipality of rost loppa and

saved by a compassionate sea nymph who take the form of a cormorant in a woman wearing a dress made of cormorant feather wa found on san nicolas island off the southern coast of california she had sewn the feather dress together using whale sinew she is known a the lone woman of san nicolas and wa later baptised juana maria her original name is lost the woman had lived alone on the island for year before being rescued when removed from san nicolas she brought with her a green cormorant dress she made this dress is reported to have been removed to the vaticanthe bird ha inspired numerous
