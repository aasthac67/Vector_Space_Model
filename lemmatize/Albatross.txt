albatross are very large seabird in the family diomedeidae albatross they range widely in the southern ocean and the north pacific they are absent from the north atlantic although fossil remains show they once occurred there and occasional vagrant are found albatross are among the largest of flying bird and specie of the genus diomedea great albatross have the longest wingspan of any extant bird reaching up to m ft the albatross are usually regarded a falling into four genus but disagreement exists over the number of specie albatross are highly efficient in the air using dynamic soaring and slope soaring to cover great distance with little exertion it is the only bird that can fly mile km without landing they feed on squid fish and krill by either scavenging surface seizing or diving albatross are colonial nesting for the most part on remote oceanic island often with several specie nesting together pair bond between male and female form over several year with the use of ritualised dance and last for the life of the pair a breeding season can take over a year from laying to fledging with a single egg laid in each breeding attempt a laysan albatross named wisdom on midway island is recognised a the oldest wild bird in the world she wa first banded in by chandler robbins of the specie of albatross recognised by the iucn all are listed a at some level of concern three specie are critically endangered five specie are endangered seven specie are near threatened and seven specie are vulnerable number of albatross have declined in the past due to harvesting for feather albatross are threatened by introduced specie such a rat and feral cat that attack egg chick and nesting adult by pollution by a serious decline in fish stock in many region largely due to overfishing and by longline fishing longline fishery pose the greatest threat a feeding bird are attracted to the bait become hooked on the line and drown identified stakeholder such a government conservation organisation and people in the fishing industry are all working toward reducing this bycatch science taxonomy and evolution the albatross designation comprises between and specie the number is still a matter of some debate being the most commonly accepted number in four genus these genus are the great albatross diomedea the mollymawk thalassarche the north pacific albatross phoebastria and the sooty albatross or sooties phoebetria the north pacific albatross are considered to be a sister taxon to the great albatross while the sooty albatross are considered closer to the mollymawksthe taxonomy of the albatross group ha been a source of much debate the taxonomy place seabird bird of prey and many others in a greatly enlarged order the ciconiiformes whereas the ornithological organisation in north america europe south africa australia and new zealand retain the more traditional order procellariiformes the albatross can be separated from the other procellariiformes both genetically and through morphological characteristic size their leg and the arrangement of their nasal tube see below morphology and flight within the family the assignment of genus ha been debated for over year originally placed into a single genus diomedea they were rearranged by reichenbach into four different genus in then lumped back together and split apart again several time acquiring different genus name in total though never more than eight at one time by diomedea phoebastria thalassarche phoebetria thalassageron diomedella nealbatrus rhothonia julietata galapagornis laysanornis and penthirenia by in an attempt to bring some order back to the classification of albatross they were lumped into two genus phoebetria the sooty albatross which most closely seemed to resemble the procellarids and were at the time considered primitive and diomedea the rest though a case wa made for the simplification of the family particularly the nomenclature the classification wa based on the morphological analysis by elliott coue in and paid little attention to more recent study and even ignored some of coue suggestionsmore recent research by gary nunn of the american museum of natural history and other researcher around the world studied the mitochondrial dna of all accepted specie finding four not two monophyletic group within the albatross they proposed the resurrection of two of the old genus name phoebastria for the north pacific albatross and thalassarche for the mollymawk with the great albatross retaining diomedea and the sooty albatross staying in phoebetria both the british ornithologist union and the south african authority split the albatross into four genus a nunn suggested and the change ha been accepted by the majority of researcher while some agree on the number of genus fewer agree on the number of specie historically up to different taxon have been described by different researcher most of these were incorrectly identified juvenile bird based on the work on albatross genus robertson and nunn went on in to propose a revised taxonomy with different specie compared to the then accepted this expanded taxonomy elevated many established subspecies to full specie but wa criticised for not using in every case peer reviewed information to justify the split since then further study have in some instance supported or disproved the split a paper analysing the mitochondrial dna and microsatellites agreed with the conclusion that the antipodean albatross and the tristan albatross were distinct from the wandering albatross per robertson and nunn but found that the suggested gibson albatross diomedea gibsoni wa not distinct from the antipodean albatross for the most part an interim taxonomy of specie is accepted by itis and many other researcher though by no mean penhallurick and wink called for the number of specie to be reduced to including the lumping of the amsterdam albatross with the wandering albatross although this paper wa itself controversial on all side is the widespread agreement on the need for further research to clarify the issue sibley and ahlquist molecular study of the evolution of the bird family ha put the radiation of the procellariiformes in the oligocene period million year ago mya though this group probably originated earlier with a fossil sometimes attributed to the order a seabird known a tytthostonyx being found in late cretaceous rock mya the molecular evidence suggests that the storm petrel were the first to diverge from the ancestral stock and the albatross next with the procellarids and diving petrel separating later the earliest fossil albatross were found in eocene to oligocene rock although some of these are only tentatively assigned to the family and none appear to be particularly close to the living form they are murunkus middle eocene of uzbekistan manu early oligocene of new zealand and an undescribed form from the late oligocene of south carolina the oldest widely accepted fossil albatross is tydea septentrionalis from the early oligocene of belgium diomedavus knapptonensis is smaller than all extant albatross and wa found in late oligocene stratum of washington state usa plotornis wa formerly often considered a petrel but is now accepted a an albatross it is from the middle miocene of france a time when the split between the four modern genus wa already underway a evidenced by phoebastria californica and diomedea milleri both being specie from sharktooth hill california these show that the split between the great albatross and the north pacific albatross occurred by mya similar fossil find in the southern hemisphere put the split between the sooties and mollymawk at mya the fossil record of the albatross in the northern hemisphere is more complete than that of the southern and many fossil form of albatross have been found in the north atlantic which today ha no albatross the remains of a colony of albatross have been uncovered on the island of bermuda and the majority of fossil albatross from the north atlantic have been of the genus phoebastria the north pacific albatross one phoebastria anglica ha been found in deposit in both north carolina and england due to convergent evolution in particular of the leg and foot bone remains of the prehistoric pseudotooth bird pelagornithidae may be mistaken for those of extinct albatross manu may be such a case and quite certainly the supposed giant albatross femur from the early pleistocene dainichi formation at kakegawa japan actually is from one of the last pseudotooth bird aldiomedes angustirostris wa a uniquely specie from the pliocene of new zealand the article on diomedea phoebastria and thalassarche contain more data on fossil specie of living albatross genus morphology and flight the albatross are a group of large to very large bird they are the largest of the procellariiformes the bill is large strong and with the upper mandible terminating in a large hook this bill is composed of several horny plate and along the side are the two tube long nostril that give the order it former name the tube of all albatross are along the side of the bill unlike the rest of the procellariiformes where the tube run along the top of the bill these tube allow the albatross to measure the exact airspeed in flight the nostril are analogous to the pitot tube in modern aircraft the albatross need accurate airspeed measurement in order to perform dynamic soaring like other procellariiformes they use their uniquely developed sense of smell to locate potential food source whereas most bird depend on eyesight the foot have no hind toe and the three anterior toe are completely webbed the leg are strong for procellariiformes making them and the giant petrel the only member of that order that can walk well on landalbatrosses along with all procellariiformes must excrete the salt they ingest in drinking sea water and eating marine invertebrate all bird have an enlarged nasal gland at the base of the bill above their eye this gland is inactive in specie that do not require it but in the procellariiformes it act a a salt gland scientist are uncertain a to it exact process but do know in general term that it remove salt by secreting a saline solution that drip out of their nose or is forcibly ejected the adult plumage of most of the albatross is usually some variation of dark and back with white underside often compared to that of a gull the extent of colouration varies the southern royal albatross is almost completely white except for the end and trailing edge of the wing in fully mature male while the amsterdam albatross ha an almost breeding plumage with a great deal of brown particularly a strong brown band around the chest several specie of mollymawk and north pacific albatross have face marking like eye patch or have grey or yellow on the head and nape three albatross specie the albatross and the two sooty albatross vary completely from the usual pattern and are almost entirely dark brown or dark grey in place in the case of the albatross albatross take several year to get their full adult breeding plumagethe wingspan of the largest great albatross genus diomedea are the largest of any bird exceeding cm ft although the other specie wingspan are considerably smaller at down to m ft the wing are stiff and cambered with thickened streamlined leading edge albatross travel huge distance with two technique used by many seabird dynamic soaring and slope soaring dynamic soaring involves repeatedly rising into wind and descending downwind thus gaining energy from the vertical wind gradient the only effort expended is in the turn at the top and bottom of every such loop this maneuver allows the bird to cover almost without flapping it wing slope soaring us the rising air on the windward side of large wave albatross have high glide ratio around to meaning that for every metre they drop they can travel forward metre they are aided in soaring by a a sheet of tendon that lock the wing when fully extended allowing the wing to be kept outstretched without any muscle expenditure a morphological adaptation they share with the giant petrel albatross combine these soaring technique with the use of predictable weather system albatross in the southern hemisphere flying north from their colony take a clockwise route and those flying south fly counterclockwise albatross are so well adapted to this lifestyle that their heart rate while flying are close to their basal heart rate when resting this efficiency is such that the most energetically demanding aspect of a foraging trip is not the distance covered but the landing and hunting they undertake having found a food source a common assumption is that albatross must be able to sleep in flight although no direct evidence ha ever been obtainedthis efficient travelling underlies the albatross success a a forager covering great distance and expending little energy looking for patchily distributed food source their adaptation to gliding flight make them dependent on wind and wave but their long wing are to powered flight and most specie lack the muscle and energy to undertake sustained flapping flight albatross in calm sea rest on the ocean surface until the wind pick up again a using powered flight is not energetically worthwhile though they are capable of flight to avoid danger the north pacific albatross can use a flight style known a where the bird progress by burst of flapping followed by gliding when taking off albatross need to take a run up to allow enough air to move under the wing to provide liftthe dynamic soaring of albatross is inspiring to airplane designer german aerospace engineer johannes traugott and colleague have charted the albatross nuanced flight pattern and are looking for way to apply this to aircraft especially in the area of drone and unmanned aircraft distribution and range at sea most albatross range in the southern hemisphere from antarctica to australia south africa and south america the exception to this are the four north pacific albatross of which three occur exclusively in the north pacific from hawaii to japan california and alaska and one the waved albatross breed in the galapagos island and feed off the coast of south america the need for wind to enable gliding is the reason albatross are for the most part confined to higher latitude being unsuited to sustained flapping flight make crossing the doldrums extremely difficult the exception the waved albatross is able to live in the equatorial water around the galapagos island because of the cool water of the humboldt current and the resulting windsit is not known for certain why the albatross became extinct in the north atlantic although rising sea level due to an interglacial warming period are thought to have submerged the site of a albatross colony that ha been excavated in bermuda some southern specie have occasionally turned up a vagrant in the north atlantic and can become exiled remaining there for decade one of these exile a albatross returned to gannet colony in scotland for many year in an attempt to breedthe use of satellite tracking is teaching scientist a great deal about the way albatross range across the ocean to find food they undertake no annual migration but disperse widely after hemisphere specie often undertake circumpolar trip evidence also exists of separate range for different specie at sea a comparison of the foraging niche of two related specie that breed on campbell island the campbell albatross and the albatross showed the campbell albatross primarily fed over the campbell plateau whereas the albatross fed in more pelagic oceanic water wandering albatross also react strongly to bathymetry feeding only in water deeper than m ft so rigidly did the satellite plot match this contour that one scientist remarked it almost appears a if the bird notice and obey a entry sign where the water shallow to le than m also evidence show different range for the two sex of the same specie a study of tristan albatross breeding on gough island showed that male foraged to the west of gough and female to the eastbirdlife ha satellite tracking record for each of the specie of albatross in their database diet the albatross diet is predominantly cephalopod fish crustacean and offal organ meat although they will also scavenge carrion and feed on other zooplankton for most specie a comprehensive understanding of diet is known for only the breeding season when the albatross regularly return to land and study is possible the importance of each of these food source varies from specie to specie and even from population to population some concentrate on squid alone others take more krill or fish of the two albatross specie found in hawaii one the albatross take mostly fish while the laysan feed on squidthe use of data logger at sea that record ingestion of water against time providing a likely time of feeding suggests that albatross predominantly feed during the day analysis of the squid beak regurgitated by albatross ha shown that many of the squid eaten are too large to have been caught alive and include specie likely to be beyond the reach of albatross suggesting that for some specie like the wandering albatross scavenged squid may be an important part of the diet the source of these dead squid is a matter of debate some certainly come from squid fishery but in nature it primarily come from the that occurs after squid spawning and the vomit of whale sperm whale pilot whale and southern bottlenose whale the diet of other specie like the albatross or the albatross is rich with smaller specie of squid that tend to sink after death and scavenging is not assumed to play a large role in their diet the waved albatross ha been observed practising kleptoparasitism harassing booby to steal their food making it the only member of it order to do so regularlyuntil recently albatross were thought to be predominantly surface feeder swimming at the surface and snapping up squid and fish pushed to the surface by current predator or death the deployment of capillary depth recorder which record the maximum dive depth undertaken by a bird ha shown that while some specie like the wandering albatross do not dive deeper than a metre some specie like the albatross have a mean diving depth of almost m and can dive a deep a m in addition to surface feeding and diving they have also been observed plunge diving from the air to snatch prey breeding and dancing albatross are colonial usually nesting on isolated island where colony are on larger landmass they are found on exposed headland with good approach from the sea in several direction like the colony on the otago peninsula in dunedin new zealand many buller albatross and albatross nest under tree in open forest colony vary from the very dense aggregation favoured by the mollymawk albatross colony on the falkland island have density of nest per to the much looser group and widely spaced individual nest favoured by the sooty and great albatross all albatross colony are on island that historically were free of land mammal albatross are highly philopatric meaning they usually return to their natal colony to breed this tendency is so strong that a study of laysan albatross showed that the average distance between hatching site and the site where a bird established it own territory wa m ft albatross live much longer than other bird they delay breeding for longer and invest more effort into fewer young most specie survive upwards of year the oldest recorded being a laysan albatross named wisdom that wa ringed in a a mature adult and hatched another chick in february making her at least year old she is the oldest confirmed wild bird and the oldest banded bird in the worldalbatrosses reach sexual maturity slowly after about five year but even once they have reached maturity they do not begin to breed for another few year even up to year for some specie young nonbreeders attend a colony prior to beginning to breed spending many year practising the elaborate breeding ritual and dance for which the family is famous bird arriving back at the colony for the first time already have the stereotyped behaviour that compose albatross language but can neither read that behaviour a exhibited by other bird nor respond appropriately after a period of trial and error learning the young bird learn the syntax and perfect the dance this language is mastered more rapidly if the younger bird are around older bird the repertoire of behaviour involves synchronised performance of various action such a preening pointing calling bill clacking staring and combination of such behaviour such a the when a bird first return to the colony it dance with many partner but after a number of year the number of interaction drop until one partner is chosen and a pair is formed they then continue to perfect an individual language that will eventually be unique to that one pair having established a pair bond that will last for life however most of that dance will never be used again albatross are held to undertake these elaborate and painstaking ritual to ensure that the appropriate partner ha been chosen and to perfect partner recognition a egg laying and chick rearing is a huge investment even specie that can complete an cycle in under a year seldom lay egg in consecutive year the great albatross ie wandering albatross take over a year to raise a chick from laying to fledging albatross lay a single subelliptical egg white with spot in a breeding season if the egg is lost to predator or accidentally broken then no further breeding attempt are made that year the larger egg weigh from to g to oz the divorce of a pair is a rare occurrence due to the diminished lifetime reproductive success it cause and usually happens only after several year of breeding failureall the southern albatross create large nest for their egg using grass shrub soil peat and even penguin feather whereas the three specie in the north pacific make more rudimentary nest the waved albatross though make no nest and even move it egg around the pair territory a much a m ft sometimes causing it to lose the egg in all albatross specie both parent incubate the egg in stint that last between one day and three week incubation last around to day longer for the larger albatross the longest incubation period of any bird it can be an energetically demanding process with the adult losing a much a g oz of body weight a day after hatching the chick which is semialtricial is brooded and guarded for three week until it is large enough to defend and thermoregulate itself during this period the parent feed the chick small meal when they relieve each other from duty after the brooding period is over the chick is fed in regular interval by both parent the parent adopt alternative pattern of short and long foraging trip providing meal that weigh around of their body weight around g oz the meal are composed of fresh squid fish and krill a well a stomach oil an food that is lighter to carry than undigested prey item this oil is created in a stomach organ known a a proventriculus from digested prey item by most procellariiformes and give them their distinctive musty smellalbatross chick take a long time to fledge in the case of the great albatross it can take up to day even for the smaller albatross it take between and day like many seabird albatross chick will gain enough weight to be heavier than their parent and prior to fledging they use these reserve to build up body condition particularly growing all their flight feather usually fledging at the same weight a their parent between and of those fledged survive to breed albatross chick fledge on their own and receive no further help from their parent which return to the nest after fledging unaware their chick ha left study of juvenile dispersing at sea have suggested an innate migration behaviour a genetically coded navigation route which help young bird when they are first out at seahybridization is rare in albatross largely due to the low incidence of vagrancy albatross and human etymology the name albatross is derived from the arabic or a pelican literally the diver which travelled to english via the portuguese form alcatraz gannet which is also the origin of the name of the former prison alcatraz the oxford english dictionary note that the word alcatraz wa originally applied to the frigatebird the modification to albatross wa perhaps influenced by latin albus meaning white in contrast to frigatebirds which are black in modern portuguese the word used for the bird albatroz is in turn derived from the english albatross they were once commonly known a goonie bird or gooney bird particularly those of the north pacific in the southern hemisphere the name mollymawk is still well established in some area which is a corrupted form of an old dutch name for the northern fulmar the name diomedea assigned to the albatross by linnaeus reference the mythical metamorphosis of the companion of the greek warrior diomedes into bird finally the name for the order procellariiformes come from the latin word procella meaning a violent wind or a storm in culture albatross have been described a the most legendary of all bird an albatross is the central emblem in the rime of the ancient mariner by samuel taylor coleridge representing the innocence and beauty of god creation the albatross metaphor is derived from this poem someone bearing a burden or facing an obstacle is said to have an albatross around his neck the punishment given to the mariner who killed the albatross a widespread myth hold that sailor believe shooting or harming an albatross is disastrous due in part to the poem in truth sailor regularly killed and ate them a reported by james cook in however other sailor reportedly caught the bird but let them free again possibly believing that albatross were the soul of lost sailor so killing them would bring bad luck the head of an albatross being caught with a hook is used a the emblem of the cape horners ie sailor who have rounded cape horn on freighter under sail captain of such ship even received themselves the title albatross in the cape horners organisation a captive albatross tormented by jeering sailor is also a metaphor for the social travail of the sensitive poete maudit in charles baudelaire poem le poete est semblable au prince de nuees qui hante la tempete et se rit de exile sur le sol au milieu de huees s ailes de geant de marcher the poet is like this prince of the cloud who haunt the storm and mock the archer but exiled on earth surrounded by jeer his giant wing make him helpless to walk in golf shooting three under par on a single hole ha recently been termed scoring an albatross a a continuation on the birdie and eagle theme mythology the maori used the wing bone of the albatross to carve flute in hawaiian mythology laysan albatross are considered aumakua being a sacred manifestation of the ancestor and quite possibly also the sacred bird of kane japanese mythology by contrast refers to the albatross a idiot bird due to it insular habitat making it disregard terrestrial predator and it wa considered an excellent target for consumption birdwatching albatross are popular bird for birdwatchers and their colony are popular destination for ecotourists regular birdwatching trip are taken out of many coastal town and city such a monterey dunedin kaikoura wollongong sydney port fairy hobart and cape town to see pelagic seabird albatross are easily attracted to these sightseeing boat by the deployment of fish oil and burley into the sea visit to colony can be very popular the northern royal albatross colony at taiaroa head in dunedin new zealand attracts visitor a year and more isolated colony are regular attraction on cruise to subantarctic island threat and conservation in spite of often being accorded legendary status albatross have not escaped either indirect or direct pressure from human early encounter with albatross by polynesian and aleut resulted in hunting and in some case extirpation from some island such a easter island a european began sailing the world they too began to hunt albatross fishing for them from boat to serve at the table or blasting them for sport this sport reached it peak on emigration line bound for australia and only died down when ship became too fast to fish from and regulation forbade the discharge of weapon for safety reason in the century albatross colony particularly those in the north pacific were harvested for the feather trade leading to the of the albatrossof the albatross specie recognised by iucn on their red list are threatened and the other two are near threatened three specie a recognised by the iucn are considered critically endangered the amsterdam albatross tristan albatross and waved albatross one of the main threat is commercial longline fishing a the albatross and other will readily feed on attracted to the set bait become hooked on the line and drown an estimated albatross per year are killed in this fashion unregulated pirate fishery exacerbate the problemon midway atoll collision between laysan albatross and aircraft have resulted in human and bird death a well a severe disruption in military flight operation study were made in the late and early that examined the result of control method such a the killing of bird the levelling and clearing of land to eliminate updraft and the destruction of annual nesting site tall structure such a traffic control and radio tower killed bird in flight collision during before the tower were taken down closure of naval air facility midway in eliminated the problem of collision with military aircraft recent reduction in human activity on the island have helped reduce bird death though lead paint pollution near military building continues to poison bird by ingestion albatross plume were popular in the early century in alone over albatross were killed on midway island and laysan island for their plumesanother threat to albatross is introduced specie such a rat or feral cat which directly attack albatross or their chick and egg albatross have evolved to breed on island where land mammal are absent and have not developed defence against them even specie a small a mouse can be detrimental on gough island the chick of tristan albatross are attacked and eaten alive by introduced house mouse introduced specie can have other indirect effect cattle overgrazed essential cover on amsterdam island threatening the amsterdam albatross on other island introduced plant reduce potential nesting habitat ingestion of plastic flotsam is another problem one faced by many seabird the amount of plastic in the sea ha increased dramatically since the first record in the coming from waste discarded by ship offshore dumping litter on beach and waste washed to sea by river it is impossible to digest and take up space in the stomach or gizzard that should be used for food or can cause an obstruction that starves the bird directly study of bird in the north pacific have shown that ingestion of plastic result in declining body weight and body condition this plastic is sometimes regurgitated and fed to chick a study of laysan albatross chick on midway atoll showed large amount of ingested plastic in naturally dead chick compared to healthy chick killed in accident while not the direct cause of death this plastic cause physiological stress and cause the chick to feel full during feeding reducing it food intake and the chance of survivalscientists and conservationist most importantly birdlife international and their partner who run the save the albatross campaign are working with government and fisherman to find solution to the threat albatross face technique such a setting longline bait at night dyeing the bait blue setting the bait underwater increasing the amount of weight on line and using bird scarer can all reduce the seabird bycatch for example a collaborative study between scientist and fisherman in new zealand successfully tested an underwater setting device for longliners which set the line below the reach of vulnerable albatross specie the use of some of these technique in the patagonian toothfish fishery in the falkland island is thought to have reduced the number of albatross taken by the fleet in the last year conservationist have also worked on the field of island restoration removing introduced specie that threaten native wildlife which protects albatross from introduced predator one important step towards protecting albatross and other seabird is the treaty the agreement on the conservation of albatross and petrel which came into force in and ha been ratified by thirteen country argentina australia brazil chile ecuador france new zealand norway peru south africa spain the united kingdom and uruguay the treaty requires these country to take specific action to reduce bycatch pollution and to remove introduced specie from nesting island specie current thinking divide the albatross into four genus the number of specie is a matter of debate the iucn and birdlife international recognise extant specie listed below itis recognise the below minus t steadi and one recent paper proposed a reduction to
