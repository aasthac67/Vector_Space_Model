adult male tend to live solitarily for most of the year during the rut late december in europe may in new zealand male engage in fierce battle for the attention of unmated female an impregnated female undergoes a gestation period of day after which a single kid is usually born in may or early june on rare occasion twin may be born if a mother is killed other female in the herd may try to raise the young the kid is weaned at six month of age and is fully grown by one year of age however the kid do not reach sexual maturity until they are three to four year old although some female may mate at a early two year old at sexual maturity young male are forced out of their mother herd by dominant male who sometimes kill them and then wander somewhat nomadically until they can establish themselves a mature breeding specimen at eight to nine year of agechamois eat various type of vegetation including highland grass and herb during the summer and conifer bark and needle from tree in winter primarily diurnal in activity they often rest around and may actively forage during moonlit nightschamois can reach an age of year in captivity although the maximum recorded in the wild is from to year of age common cause of mortality can include avalanche epidemic and predation at present human are the main predator of chamois in the past the principal predator were eurasian lynx persian leopard and gray wolf with some predation possibly by brown bear and golden eagle chamois usually use speed and stealthy evasion to escape predator and can run at kilometer per hour mph and can jump m ft vertically into the air or over a distance of m ft distribution and habitat chamois are naturally distributed in the pyrenees the mountain of south and central europe turkey and the caucasus in asia they live at moderately high altitude and are adapted to living in precipitous rugged rocky terrain they can be found at elevation up to at least m ft in europe chamois spend their summer above the tree line in meadow when winter roll around they go to lower elevation of around m ft to live in forest mainly in area dominated by pine in new zealand alpine chamois arrived in new zealand in a a gift from the austrian emperor franz joseph i in exchange for specimen of living fern rare bird and lizard mr albert el bertling formerly head keeper of the zoological society garden regent park london accepted an invitation from the new zealand government to deliver a consignment of chamois two buck and six doe to the colony they arrived in wellington new zealand on january on board the s turakina from wellington the chamois were transhipped to the manaroa and conveyed to lyttelton then by rail to fairlie in south canterbury and a horse trek to mount cook the first surviving release were made in the aoraki mount cook region and these animal gradually spread over much of the south islandin new zealand chamois hunting is unrestricted and even encouraged by the department of conservation to limit the animal impact on new zealand native alpine floranew zealand chamois tend to weigh about le than european individual of the same age suggesting that food supply may be limited hunting and wildlife management a their meat is considered tasty chamois are popular game animal chamois have two trait that are exploited by hunter the first is that they are most active in the morning and evening when they feed the second is that they tend to look for danger originating from below which mean that a hunter stalking chamois from above is le likely to be observed and more
