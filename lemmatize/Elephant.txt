elephant are mammal of the family elephantidae and the largest existing land animal three specie are currently recognised the african bush elephant the african forest elephant and the asian elephant elephantidae is the only surviving family of the order proboscidea extinct member include the mastodon the family elephantidae also contains several group including the mammoth and elephant african elephant have larger ear and concave back whereas asian elephant have smaller ear and convex or level back distinctive feature of all elephant include a long trunk tusk large ear flap massive leg and tough but sensitive skin the trunk also called a proboscis is used for breathing bringing food and water to the mouth and grasping object tusk which are derived from the incisor teeth serve both a weapon and a tool for moving object and digging the large ear flap assist in maintaining a constant body temperature a well a in communication the leg carry their great weight elephant are scattered throughout africa south asia and southeast asia and are found in different habitat including savannah forest desert and marsh they are herbivorous and they stay near water when it is accessible they are considered to be keystone specie due to their impact on their environment other animal tend to keep their distance from elephant the exception is their predator such a lion tiger hyena and wild dog which usually target only young elephant calf elephant have a society in which multiple family group come together to socialise female cow tend to live in family group which can consist of one female with her calf or several related female with offspring the group which do not include bull are led by the usually oldest cow known a the matriarch male bull leave their family group when they reach puberty and may live alone or with other male adult bull mostly interact with family group when looking for a mate they enter a state of increased testosterone and aggression known a musth which help them gain dominance over other male a well a reproductive success calf are the centre of attention in their family group and rely on their mother for a long a three year elephant can live up to year in the wild they communicate by touch sight smell and sound elephant use infrasound and seismic communication over long distance elephant intelligence ha been compared with that of primate and cetacean they appear to have a well a appearing to show empathy for dying and dead family member african elephant are listed a vulnerable and asian elephant a endangered by the international union for conservation of nature iucn one of the biggest threat to elephant population is the ivory trade a the animal are poached for their ivory tusk other threat to wild elephant include habitat destruction and conflict with local people elephant are used a working animal in asia in the past they were used in war today they are often controversially put on display in zoo or exploited for entertainment in circus elephant are highly recognisable and have been featured in art folklore religion literature and popular culture etymology the word elephant is based on the latin elephas genitive elephantis elephant which is the latinised form of the greek elephas elephas genitive elephantos elephantos probably from a language likely phoenician it is attested in mycenaean greek a genitive in linear b syllabic script a in mycenaean greek homer used the greek word to mean ivory but after the time of herodotus it also referred to the animal the word elephant appears in middle english a olyfaunt and wa borrowed from old french oliphant century taxonomy and phylogeny elephant belong to the family elephantidae the sole remaining family within the order proboscidea which belongs to the superorder afrotheria their closest extant relative are the sirenian dugong and manatee and the hyrax with which they share the clade paenungulata within the superorder afrotheria elephant and sirenian are further grouped in the clade tethytheriathree specie of elephant are recognised the african bush elephant loxodonta africana and forest elephant loxodonta cyclotis of africa and the asian elephant elephas maximus of south and southeast asia african elephant have larger ear a concave back more wrinkled skin a sloping abdomen and two extension at the tip of the trunk asian elephant have smaller ear a convex or level back smoother skin a horizontal abdomen that occasionally sag in the middle and one extension at the tip of the trunk the looped ridge on the molar are narrower in the asian elephant while those of the african are more the asian elephant also ha dorsal bump on it head and some patch of depigmentation on it skinamong african elephant forest elephant have smaller and more rounded ear and thinner and straighter tusk than bush elephant and are limited in range to the forested area of western and central africa both kind of elephant were traditionally considered to be the same specie loxodonta africana but molecular study have affirmed their status a separate specie in dna sequence analysis showed that l cyclotis is more closely related to the extinct palaeoloxodon antiquus than it is to l africana possibly undermining the genus loxodonta a a whole evolution and extinct relative over extinct member and three major evolutionary radiation of the order proboscidea have been recorded the earliest proboscids the african eritherium and phosphatherium of the late paleocene heralded the first radiation the eocene included numidotherium moeritherium and barytherium from africa these animal were relatively small and aquatic later on genus such a phiomia and palaeomastodon arose the latter likely inhabited forest and open woodland proboscidean diversity declined during the oligocene one notable specie of this epoch wa eritreum melakeghebrekristosi of the horn of africa which may have been an ancestor to several later specie the beginning of the miocene saw the second diversification with the appearance of the deinotheres and the mammutids the former were related to barytherium and lived in africa and eurasia while the latter may have descended from eritreum and spread to north americathe second radiation wa represented by the emergence of the gomphothere in the miocene which likely evolved from eritreum and originated in africa spreading to every continent except australia and antarctica member of this group included gomphotherium and platybelodon the third radiation started in the late miocene and led to the arrival of the elephantids which descended from and slowly replaced the gomphothere the african primelephas gomphotheroides gave rise to loxodonta mammuthus and elephas loxodonta branched off earliest around the miocene and pliocene boundary while mammuthus and elephas diverged later during the early pliocene loxodonta remained in africa while mammuthus and elephas spread to eurasia and the former reached north america at the same time the stegodontids another proboscidean group descended from gomphothere spread throughout asia including the indian subcontinent china southeast asia and japan mammutids continued to evolve into new specie such a the american mastodonat the beginning of the pleistocene elephantids experienced a high rate of speciation the pleistocene also saw the arrival of palaeoloxodon namadicus the largest terrestrial mammal of all time loxodonta atlantica became the most common specie in northern and southern africa but wa replaced by elephas iolensis later in the pleistocene only when elephas disappeared from africa did loxodonta become dominant once again this time in the form of the modern specie elephas diversified into new specie in asia such a e hysudricus and e platycephus the latter the likely ancestor of the modern asian elephant mammuthus evolved into several specie including the woolly mammoth interbreeding appears to have been common among elephantid specie which in some case led to specie with three ancestral genetic component such a the palaeoloxodon antiquus in the late pleistocene most proboscidean specie vanished during the quaternary glaciation which killed off of genus weighing over kg lb worldwideproboscideans experienced several evolutionary trend such a an increase in size which led to many giant specie that stood up to cm ft in tall a with other megaherbivores including the extinct sauropod dinosaur the large size of elephant likely developed to allow them to survive on vegetation with low nutritional value their limb grew longer and the foot shorter and broader the foot were originally plantigrade and developed into a digitigrade stance with cushion pad and the sesamoid bone providing support early proboscidean developed longer mandible and smaller cranium while more derived one developed shorter mandible which shifted the head centre of gravity the skull grew larger especially the cranium while the neck shortened to provide better support for the skull the increase in size led to the development and elongation of the mobile trunk to provide reach the number of premolar incisor and canine decreased the cheek teeth molar and premolar became larger and more specialized especially after elephant started to switch from to which caused their teeth to undergo a increase in teeth height a well a substantial multiplication of lamella after about five million year ago only in the last million year or so did they return to a diet mainly consisting of tree and shrub the upper second incisor grew into tusk which varied in shape from straight to curved either upward or downward to spiralled depending on the specie some proboscidean developed tusk from their lower incisor elephant retain certain feature from their aquatic ancestry such a their middle ear anatomy dwarf specie several specie of proboscidean lived on island and experienced insular dwarfism this occurred primarily during the pleistocene when some elephant population became isolated by fluctuating sea level although dwarf elephant did exist earlier in the pliocene these elephant likely grew smaller on island due to a lack of large or viable predator population and limited resource by contrast small mammal such a rodent develop gigantism in these condition dwarf proboscidean are known to have lived in indonesia the channel island of california and several island of the mediterraneanelephas celebensis of sulawesi is believed to have descended from elephas planifrons palaeoloxodon falconeri of malta and sicily wa only cm ft in and had probably evolved from the elephant other descendant of the elephant existed in cyprus dwarf elephant of uncertain descent lived in crete cyclades and dodecanese while dwarf mammoth are known to have lived in sardinia the columbian mammoth colonised the channel island and evolved into the pygmy mammoth this specie reached a height of cm ft ft in and weighed kg lb a population of small woolly mammoth survived on wrangel island now km mi north of the siberian coast a recently a year ago after their discovery in they were considered dwarf mammoth this classification ha been and since the second international mammoth conference in these animal are no longer considered to be true dwarf mammoth characteristic size elephant are the largest living terrestrial animal african bush elephant are the largest specie with male being cm ft ft in tall at the shoulder with a body mass of t short ton and female standing cm ft ft in tall at the shoulder with a body mass of t short ton male asian elephant are usually about cm ft ft in tall at the shoulder and t short ton whereas female are cm ft ft in tall at the shoulder and t short ton african forest elephant are the smallest specie with male usually being around cm ft ft in tall at the shoulder and t short ton male african bush elephant are typically taller than female whereas male asian elephant are only around taller than female bone the skeleton of the elephant is made up of bone the vertebra are connected by tight joint which limit the backbone flexibility african elephant have pair of rib while asian elephant have or pair head an elephant skull is resilient enough to withstand the force generated by the leverage of the tusk and collision the back of the skull is flattened and spread out creating arch that protect the brain in every direction the skull contains air cavity sinus that reduce the weight of the skull while maintaining overall strength these cavity give the inside of the skull a appearance the cranium is particularly large and provides enough room for the attachment of muscle to support the entire head the lower jaw is solid and heavy because of the size of the head the neck is relatively short to provide better support lacking a lacrimal apparatus the eye relies on the harderian gland to keep it moist a durable nictitating membrane protects the eye globe the animal field of vision is compromised by the location and limited mobility of the eye elephant are considered dichromat and they can see well in dim light but not in bright light the core body temperature average similar to that of a human like all mammal an elephant can raise or lower it temperature a few degree from the average in response to extreme environmental condition ear elephant ear have thick base with thin tip the ear flap or pinna contain numerous blood vessel called capillary warm blood flow into the capillary helping to release excess body heat into the environment this occurs when the pinna are still and the animal can enhance the effect by flapping them larger ear surface contain more capillary and more heat can be released of all the elephant african bush elephant live in the hottest climate and have the largest ear flap elephant are capable of hearing at low frequency and are most sensitive at khz in close proximity to the soprano c trunk the trunk or proboscis is a fusion of the nose and upper lip although in early fetal life the upper lip and trunk are separated the trunk is elongated and specialised to become the elephant most important and versatile appendage it contains up to separate muscle fascicle with no bone and little fat these paired muscle consist of two major type superficial surface and internal the former are divided into dorsals ventrals and lateral while the latter are divided into transverse and radiating muscle the muscle of the trunk connect to a bony opening in the skull the nasal septum is composed of tiny muscle unit that stretch horizontally between the nostril cartilage divide the nostril at the base a a muscular hydrostat the trunk move by precisely coordinated muscle contraction the muscle work both with and against each other a unique proboscis nerve formed by the maxillary and facial nerve run along both side of the trunkelephant trunk have multiple function including breathing olfaction touching grasping and sound production the animal sense of smell may be four time a sensitive a that of a bloodhound the trunk ability to make powerful twisting and coiling movement allows it to collect food wrestle with other elephant and lift up to kg lb it can be used for delicate task such a wiping an eye and checking an orifice and is capable of cracking a peanut shell without breaking the seed with it trunk an elephant can reach item at height of up to m ft and dig for water under mud or sand individual may show lateral preference when grasping with their trunk some prefer to twist them to the left others to the right elephant can suck up water both to drink and to spray on their body an adult asian elephant is capable of holding l u gal of water in it trunk they will also spray dust or grass on themselves when underwater the elephant us it trunk a a snorkelthe african elephant ha two extension at the tip of the trunk that allow it to grasp and bring food to it mouth the asian elephant ha only one and relies more on wrapping around a food item and squeezing it into it mouth asian elephant have more muscle coordination and can perform more complex task losing the trunk would be detrimental to an elephant survival although in rare case individual have survived with shortened one one elephant ha been observed to graze by kneeling on it front leg raising on it hind leg and taking in grass with it lip floppy trunk syndrome is a condition of trunk paralysis in african bush elephant caused by the degradation of the peripheral nerve and muscle beginning at the tip teeth elephant usually have teeth the incisor known a the tusk deciduous premolar and molar unlike most mammal which grow baby teeth and then replace them with a single permanent set of adult teeth elephant are polyphyodonts that have cycle of tooth rotation throughout their life the chewing teeth are replaced six time in a typical elephant lifetime teeth are not replaced by new one emerging from the jaw vertically a in most mammal instead new teeth grow in at the back of the mouth and move forward to push out the old one the first chewing tooth on each side of the jaw fall out when the elephant is two to three year old the second set of chewing teeth fall out at four to six year old the third set fall out at year of age and set four last until year of age the fifth set of teeth fall out at the early the sixth and usually final set must last the elephant the rest of it life elephant teeth have dental ridge which are thicker and more in african elephant tusk the tusk of an elephant are modified second incisor in the upper jaw they replace deciduous milk teeth at month of age and grow continuously at about cm in a year a newly developed tusk ha a smooth enamel cap that eventually wear off the dentine is known a ivory and it consists of crisscrossing line pattern known a engine turning which create area a a piece of living tissue a tusk is relatively soft it is a hard a the mineral calcite much of the tusk can be seen outside the rest is in a socket in the skull at least of the tusk contains the pulp and some have nerve stretching to the tip thus it would be difficult to remove it without harming the animal when removed ivory begin to dry up and crack if not kept cool and moist tusk serve multiple purpose they are used for digging for water salt and root debarking or marking tree and for moving tree and branch when clearing a path when fighting they are used to attack and defend and to protect the trunklike human who are typically or elephant are usually or the dominant tusk called the master tusk is generally more worn down a it is shorter with a rounder tip for the african elephant tusk are present in both male and female and are around the same length in both sex reaching up to cm ft in but those of male tend to be thicker in earlier time elephant tusk weighing over pound more than kg were not uncommon though it is rare today to see any over pound kg in the asian specie only the male have large tusk female asian have very small tusk or none at all tuskless male exist and are particularly common among sri lankan elephant asian male can have tusk a long a african but they are usually slimmer and lighter the largest recorded wa cm ft in long and weighed kg lb hunting for elephant ivory in africa and asia ha led to natural selection for shorter tusk and tusklessness skin an elephant skin is generally very tough at cm in thick on the back and part of the head the skin around the mouth anus and inside of the ear is considerably thinner elephant typically have grey skin but african elephant look brown or reddish after wallowing in coloured mud asian elephant have some patch of depigmentation particularly on the forehead and ear and the area around them calf have brownish or reddish hair especially on the head and back a elephant mature their hair darkens and becomes sparser but dense concentration of hair and bristle remain on the end of the tail a well a the chin genitals and the area around the eye and ear opening normally the skin of an asian elephant is covered with more hair than it african counterpartan elephant us mud a a sunscreen protecting it skin from ultraviolet light although tough an elephant skin is very sensitive without regular mud bath to protect it from burning insect bite and moisture loss an elephant skin suffers serious damage after bathing the elephant will usually use it trunk to blow dust onto it body and this dry into a protective crust elephant have difficulty releasing heat through the skin because of their low ratio which is many time smaller than that of a human they have even been observed lifting up their leg presumably in an effort to expose their sol to the air leg locomotion and posture to support the animal weight an elephant limb are positioned more vertically under the body than in most other mammal the long bone of the limb have cancellous bone in place of medullary cavity this strengthens the bone while still allowing haematopoiesis both the front and hind limb can support an elephant weight although is borne by the front since the limb bone are placed on top of each other and under the body an elephant can stand still for long period of time without using much energy elephant are incapable of rotating their front leg a the ulna and radius are fixed in pronation the palm of the manus face backward the pronator quadratus and the pronator teres are either reduced or absent the circular foot of an elephant have soft tissue or cushion pad beneath the manus or pe which distribute the weight of the animal they appear to have a sesamoid an extra toe similar in placement to a giant panda extra thumb that also help in weight distribution a many a five toenail can be found on both the front and hind feetelephants can move both forward and backwards but can not trot jump or gallop they use only two gait when moving on land the walk and a faster gait similar to running in walking the leg act a pendulum with the hip and shoulder rising and falling while the foot is planted on the ground with no aerial phase the fast gait doe not meet all the criterion of running although the elephant us it leg much like other running animal with the hip and shoulder falling and then rising while the foot are on the ground elephant appear to with their front leg but with their hind leg and can reach a top speed of mph at this speed most other quadruped are well into a gallop even accounting for leg length kinetics could explain the difference between the motion of elephant and other animal during locomotion the cushion pad expand and contract and reduce both the pain and noise that would come from a very heavy animal moving elephant are capable swimmer they have been recorded swimming for up to six hour without touching the bottom and have travelled a far a km mi at a stretch and at speed of up to mph organ the brain of an elephant weighs kg lb compared to kg lb for a human brain while the elephant brain is larger overall it is proportionally smaller at birth an elephant brain already weighs of it adult weight the cerebrum and cerebellum are well developed and the temporal lobe are so large that they bulge out laterally the throat of an elephant appears to contain a pouch where it can store water for later use the larynx of the elephant is the largest known among mammal the vocal fold are long and are attached close to the epiglottis base when comparing an elephant vocal fold to those of a human an elephant are longer thicker and have a larger area in addition they are tilted at degree and positioned more anteriorly than a human vocal foldsthe heart of an elephant weighs kg lb it ha a apex an unusual trait among mammal in addition the ventricle separate near the top of the heart a trait they share with sirenian when standing the elephant heart beat approximately time per minute unlike many other animal the heart rate speed up by to beat per minute when the elephant is lying down the blood vessel in most of the body are wide and thick and can withstand high blood pressure the lung are attached to the diaphragm and breathing relies mainly on the diaphragm rather than the expansion of the ribcage connective tissue exists in place of the pleural cavity this may allow the animal to deal with the pressure difference when it body is underwater and it trunk is breaking the surface for air although this explanation ha been questioned another possible function for this adaptation is that it help the animal suck up water through the trunk elephant inhale mostly through the trunk although some air go through the mouth they have a hindgut fermentation system and their large and small intestine together reach m ft in length the majority of an elephant food intake go undigested despite the process lasting up to a daya male elephant testis are located internally near the kidney the elephant penis can reach a length of cm in and a diameter of cm in at the base it is when fully erect and ha a orifice the female ha a clitoris at up to cm in the vulva is located between the hind leg instead of near the tail a in most mammal determining pregnancy status can be difficult due to the animal large abdominal cavity the female mammary gland occupy the space between the front leg which put the suckling calf within reach of the female trunk elephant have a unique organ the temporal gland located in both side of the head this organ is associated with sexual behaviour and male secrete a fluid from it when in musth female have also been observed with secretion from the temporal gland core body temperature the core body temperature average similar to that of a human like all mammal an elephant can raise or lower it temperature a few degree from the average in response to extreme environmental condition behaviour and life history ecology and activity the african bush elephant can be found in habitat a diverse a dry savannah desert marsh and lake shore and in elevation from sea level to mountain area above the snow line forest elephant mainly live in equatorial forest but will enter gallery forest and ecotones between forest and savannah asian elephant prefer area with a mix of grass low woody plant and tree primarily inhabiting dry forest in southern india and sri lanka and evergreen forest in malaya elephant are herbivorous and will eat leaf twig fruit bark grass and root they are born with sterile intestine and require bacteria obtained from their mother feces to digest vegetation african elephant are mostly browser while asian elephant are mainly grazers they can consume a much a kg lb of food and l u gal of water in a day elephant tend to stay near water source major feeding bout take place in the morning afternoon and night at midday elephant rest under tree and may doze off while standing sleeping occurs at night while the animal is lying down elephant average hour of sleep per day both male and family group typically move km mi a day but distance a far a km mi have been recorded in the etosha region of namibia elephant go on seasonal migration in search of food water mineral and mate at chobe national park botswana herd travel km mi to visit the river when the local waterholes dry upbecause of their large size elephant have a huge impact on their environment and are considered keystone specie their habit of uprooting tree and undergrowth can transform savannah into grassland when they dig for water during drought they create waterholes that can be used by other animal they can enlarge waterholes when they bathe and wallow in them at mount elgon elephant excavate cave that are used by ungulate hyrax bat bird and insect elephant are important seed dispersers african forest elephant ingest and defecate seed with either no effect or a positive effect on germination the seed are typically dispersed in large amount over great distance in asian forest large seed require giant herbivore like elephant and rhinoceros for transport and dispersal this ecological niche can not be filled by the next largest herbivore the tapir because most of the food elephant eat go undigested their dung can provide food for other animal such a dung beetle and monkey elephant can have a negative impact on ecosystem at murchison fall national park in uganda the overabundance of elephant ha threatened several specie of small bird that depend on woodland their weight can compact the soil which cause the rain to run off leading to erosion elephant typically coexist peacefully with other herbivore which will usually stay out of their way some aggressive interaction between elephant and rhinoceros have been recorded at aberdare national park kenya a rhino attacked an elephant calf and wa killed by the other elephant in the group at game reserve south africa introduced young orphan elephant went on a killing spree that claimed the life of rhino during the but ended with the introduction of older male the size of adult elephant make them nearly invulnerable to predator though there are rare report of adult elephant falling prey to tiger calf may be preyed on by lion spotted hyena and wild dog in africa and tiger in asia the lion of savuti botswana have adapted to hunting elephant mostly juvenile or during the dry season and a pride of lion ha been recorded killing juvenile individual between the age of four and eleven year elephant appear to distinguish between the growl of larger predator like tiger and smaller predator like leopard which have not been recorded killing calf they react to leopard le fearfully and more aggressively elephant tend to have high number of parasite particularly nematode compared to other herbivore this is due to lower predation pressure that would otherwise kill off many of the individual with significant parasite load social organisation female elephant spend their entire life in matrilineal family group some of which are made up of more than ten member including three mother and their dependent offspring and are led by the matriarch which is often the eldest female she remains leader of the group until death or if she no longer ha the energy for the role a study on zoo elephant showed that when the matriarch died the level of faecal corticosterone hormone dramatically increased in the surviving elephant when her tenure is over the matriarch eldest daughter take her place this occurs even if her sister is present one study found that younger matriarch are more likely than older one to to severe danger family group may split after becoming too large for the available resourcesthe social circle of the female elephant doe not necessarily end with the small family unit in the case of elephant in amboseli national park kenya a female life involves interaction with other family clan and subpopulation family may associate and bond with each other forming what are known a bond group which typically made of two family group during the dry season elephant family may cluster together and form another level of social organisation known a the clan group within these clan do not form strong bond but they defend their range against other clan there are typically nine group in a clan the amboseli elephant population is further divided into the central and peripheral subpopulationssome elephant population in india and sri lanka have similar basic social organisation there appear to be cohesive family unit and loose aggregation they have been observed to have nursing unit and unit in southern india elephant population may contain family group bond group and possibly clan family group tend to be small consisting of one or two adult female and their offspring a group containing more than two adult female plus offspring is known a a joint family malay elephant population have even smaller family unit and do not have any social organisation higher than a family or bond group group of african forest elephant typically consist of one adult female with one to three offspring these group appear to interact with each other especially at forest clearingsthe social life of the adult male is very different a he matures a male spends more time at the edge of his group and associate with outside male or even other family at amboseli young male spend over of their time away from their family when they are when male permanently leave they either live alone or with other male the former is typical of bull in dense forest asian male are usually solitary but occasionally form group of two or more individual the largest consisted of seven bull larger bull group consisting of over member occur only among african bush elephant the largest of which numbered up to individualsmale elephant can be quite sociable when not competing for dominance or mate and will form relationship a dominance hierarchy exists among male whether they range socially or solitarily dominance depends on the age size and sexual condition and when in group male follow the lead of the dominant bull young bull may seek out the company and leadership of older more experienced male whose presence appears to control their aggression and prevent them from exhibiting deviant behaviour adult male and female come together for reproduction bull associate with family group if an oestrous cow is present sexual behaviour musth adult male enter a state of increased testosterone known a musth in a population in southern india male first enter musth at the age of but it is not very intense until they are older than at amboseli bull under do not go into musth while half of those aged and all those over do young bull appear to enter musth during the dry season while older bull go through it during the wet season the main characteristic of a bull musth is a fluid secreted from the temporal gland that run down the side of his face he may urinate with his penis still in his sheath which cause the urine to spray on his hind leg behaviour associated with musth include walking with the head held high and swinging picking at the ground with the tusk marking rumbling and waving only one ear at a time this can last from a day to four monthsmales become extremely aggressive during musth size is the determining factor in agonistic encounter when the individual have the same condition in contest between musth and individual musth bull win the majority of the time even when the bull is larger a male may stop showing sign of musth when he encounter a musth male of higher rank those of equal rank tend to avoid each other agonistic encounter typically consist of threat display chase and minor sparring with the tusk serious fight are rare mating elephant are polygynous breeder and copulation are most frequent during the peak of the wet season a cow in oestrus release chemical signal pheromone in her urine and vaginal secretion to signal her readiness to mate a bull will follow a potential mate and ass her condition with the flehmen response which requires the male to collect a chemical sample with his trunk and bring it to the vomeronasal organ the oestrous cycle of a cow last week with a follicular phase and an to luteal phase while most mammal have one surge of luteinizing hormone during the follicular phase elephant have two the first or anovulatory surge could signal to male that the female is in oestrus by changing her scent but ovulation doe not occur until the second or ovulatory surge fertility rate in cow decline around year of agebulls engage in a behaviour known a where they follow oestrous female and defend them from other male most is done by musth male and female actively seek to be guarded by them particularly older one thus these bull have more reproductive success musth appears to signal to female the condition of the male a weak or injured male do not have normal musth for young female the approach of an older bull can be intimidating so her relative stay nearby to provide support and reassurance during copulation the male lay his trunk over the female back the penis is very mobile being able to move independently of the pelvis prior to mounting it curve forward and upward copulation last about second and doe not involve pelvic thrusting or ejaculatory pause elephant sperm must swim close to m ft to reach the egg by comparison human sperm ha to swim around only mm in homosexual behaviour is frequent in both sex a in heterosexual interaction this involves mounting male elephant sometimes stimulate each other by playfighting and championship may form between old bull and younger male female behaviour have been documented only in captivity where they are known to masturbate one another with their trunk birth and development gestation in elephant typically last around two year with interbirth interval usually lasting four to five year birth tend to take place during the wet season calf are born cm in tall and weigh around kg lb typically only a single young is born but twin sometimes occur the relatively long pregnancy is maintained by five corpus luteums a opposed to one in most mammal and give the foetus more time to develop particularly the brain and trunk a such newborn elephant are precocial and quickly stand and walk to follow their mother and family herd a new calf is usually the centre of attention for herd member adult and most of the other young will gather around the newborn touching and caressing it with their trunk for the first few day the mother is intolerant of other herd member near her young alloparenting where a calf is cared for by someone other than it mother take place in some family group allomothers are typically two to twelve year old when a predator is near the family group gather together with the calf in the centrefor the first few day the newborn is unsteady on it foot and need the support of it mother it relies on touch smell and hearing a it eyesight is poor it ha little precise control over it trunk which wiggle around and may cause it to trip by it second week of life the calf can walk more firmly and ha more control over it trunk after it first month a calf can pick up hold and put object in it mouth but can not suck water through the trunk and must drink directly through the mouth it is still dependent on it mother and keep close to herfor it first three month a calf relies entirely on milk from it mother for nutrition after which it begin to forage for vegetation and can use it trunk to collect water at the same time improvement in lip and leg coordination occur calf continue to suckle at the same rate a before until their sixth month after which they become more independent when feeding by nine month mouth trunk and foot coordination is perfected after a year a calf ability to groom drink and feed itself are fully developed it still need it mother for nutrition and protection from predator for at least another year suckling bout tend to last for a calf younger than a year and it continues to suckle until it reach three year of age or older suckling after two year may serve to maintain growth rate body condition and reproductive abilityplay behaviour in calf differs between the sex female run or chase each other while male the former are sexually mature by the age of nine year while the latter become mature around year adulthood start at about year of age in both sex elephant have long lifespan reaching year of age lin wang a captive male asian elephant lived for year communication touching is an important form of communication among elephant individual greet each other by stroking or wrapping their trunk the latter also occurs during mild competition older elephant use kick and shove to discipline younger one individual of any age and sex will touch each other mouth temporal gland and genitals particularly during meeting or when excited this allows individual to pick up chemical cue touching is especially important for communication when moving elephant mother will touch their calf with their trunk or foot when or with their tail if the calf is behind them if a calf want to rest it will press against it mother front leg and when it want to suckle it will touch her breast or legvisual display mostly occur in agonistic situation elephant will try to appear more threatening by raising their head and spreading their ear they may add to the display by shaking their head and snapping their ear a well a throwing dust and vegetation they are usually bluffing when performing these action excited elephant may raise their trunk submissive one will lower their head and trunk a well a flatten their ear against their neck while those that accept a challenge will position their ear in a v shapeelephants produce several sound usually through the larynx though some may be modified by the trunk perhaps the most well known call is the trumpet which is made by blowing through the trunk trumpeting is made during excitement distress or aggression fighting elephant may roar or squeal and wounded one may bellow rumble are produced during mild arousal and some appear to be infrasonic these call occur at frequency le than hz infrasonic call are important particularly for communication in both asian and african elephant for asian elephant these call have a frequency of hz with sound pressure level of db and last second for african elephant call range from hz with sound pressure level a high a db allowing communication for many kilometre with a possible maximum range of around km mi from various experiment the elephant larynx is shown to produce various and complex vibratory phenomenon during in vivo situation these phenomenon could be triggered when the vocal fold and vocal tract interact to raise or lower the fundamental frequency one of the vibratory phenomenon that occurred inside the larynx is alternating and traveling wave which happened due to the unusual larynx layout this can be characterized by it unique glottal pattern when the trachea is at pressure of approximately kpa phonation begin in the larynx and the laryngeal tissue start to vibrate at approximately kpa vocal production mechanism at certain frequency are similar to that of human and other mammal and the laryngeal tissue are subjected to oscillation two biomechanical feature can trigger these traveling wave pattern which are a low fundamental frequency and in the vocal fold increasing longitudinal tensionat amboseli several different infrasonic call have been identified a greeting rumble is emitted by member of a family group after having been separated for several hour contact call are soft unmodulated sound made by individual that have been separated from their group and may be responded to with a contact answer call that start out loud but becomes softer a let go soft rumble is emitted by the matriarch to signal to the other herd member that it is time to move to another spot bull in musth emit a distinctive pulsated rumble nicknamed the motorcycle musth rumble may be answered by the female chorus a modulated chorus produced by several cow a loud postcopulatory call may be made by an oestrous cow after mating when a cow ha mated her family may produce call of excitement known a the mating pandemonium elephant are known to communicate with seismics vibration produced by impact on the earth surface or acoustical wave that travel through it they appear to rely on their leg and shoulder bone to transmit the signal to the middle ear when detecting seismic signal the animal lean forward and put more weight on their larger front foot this is known a the freezing behaviour elephant posse several adaptation suited for seismic communication the cushion pad of the foot contain cartilaginous node and have similarity to the acoustic fat found in marine mammal like toothed whale and sirenian a unique muscle around the ear canal constricts the passageway thereby dampening acoustic signal and allowing the animal to hear more seismic signal elephant appear to use seismics for a number of purpose an individual running or mock charging can create seismic signal that can be heard at great distance when detecting the seismics of an alarm call signalling danger from predator elephant enter a defensive posture and family group will pack together seismic waveform produced by locomotion appear to travel distance of up to km mi while those from vocalisation travel km mi intelligence and cognition elephant exhibit mirror an indication of and cognition that ha also been demonstrated in some ape and dolphin one study of a captive female asian elephant suggested the animal wa capable of learning and distinguishing between several visual and some acoustic discrimination pair this individual wa even able to score a high accuracy rating when with the same visual pair a year later elephant are among the specie known to use tool an asian elephant ha been observed modifying branch and using them a flyswatter tool modification by these animal is not a advanced a that of chimpanzee elephant are popularly thought of a having an excellent memory this could have a factual basis they possibly have cognitive map to allow them to remember space over long period of time individual appear to be able to keep track of the current location of their family membersscientists debate the extent to which elephant feel emotion they appear to show interest in the bone of their own kind regardless of whether they are related a with chimp and dolphin a dying or dead elephant may elicit attention and aid from others including those from other group this ha been interpreted a expressing concern however others would dispute such an interpretation a being anthropomorphic the oxford companion to animal behaviour advised that one is well advised to study the behaviour rather than attempting to get at any underlying emotion conservation status african elephant were listed a vulnerable by the international union for conservation of nature iucn in with no independent assessment of the conservation status of the two form in africa had an estimated minimum population of million elephant with a possible upper limit of million by the population wa estimated to be with in central africa in eastern africa in southern africa and in western africa about elephant were estimated to live in the rainforest fewer than had previously been thought from to elephant population declined by in east africa after loss in elephant number accelerated and savannah population from cameroon to somalia experienced a decline of african forest elephant had a total loss of population trend in southern africa were mixed with anecdotal report of loss in zambia mozambique and angola while population grew in botswana and zimbabwe and were stable in south africa conversely study in and found population in eastern and southern africa were increasing by an average annual rate of due to the vast area involved assessing the total african elephant population remains difficult and involves an element of guesswork the iucn estimate a total of around individual for while traffic estimate a many a are poached dailyafrican elephant receive at least some legal protection in every country where they are found but of their range exists outside protected area successful conservation effort in certain area have led to high population density a of local number were controlled by contraception or translocation cullings ceased in when zimbabwe abandoned the practice in the african elephant wa listed under appendix i by the convention on international trade in endangered specie of wild fauna and flora cite making trade illegal appendix ii status which allows restricted trade wa given to elephant in botswana namibia and zimbabwe in and south africa in in some country sport hunting of the animal is legal botswana cameroon gabon mozambique namibia south africa tanzania zambia and zimbabwe have cite export quota for elephant trophy in june the first lady of kenya margaret kenyatta helped launch the east africa elephant education campaign walk organised by elephant conservationist jim nyamu the event wa conducted to raise awareness of the value of elephant and rhino to help mitigate conflict and to promote activitiesin the iucn listed the asian elephant a endangered due to a population decline over the past year while cite list the specie under appendix i asian elephant once ranged from syria and iraq the subspecies elephas maximus asurus to china up to the yellow river and java it is now extinct in these area and the current range of asian elephant is highly fragmented the total population of asian elephant is estimated to be around although this may be a loose estimate it is likely that around half of the population is in india although asian elephant are declining in number overall particularly in southeast asia the population in the western ghat appears to be increasing threat the poaching of elephant for their ivory meat and hide ha been one of the major threat to their existence historically numerous culture made ornament and other work of art from elephant ivory and it use rivalled that of gold the ivory trade contributed to the african elephant population decline in the late century this prompted international ban on ivory import starting with the united state in june and followed by ban in other north american country western european country and japan around the same time kenya destroyed all it ivory stock cite approved an international ban on ivory that went into effect in january following the ban unemployment rose in india and china where the ivory industry wa important economically by contrast japan and hong kong which were also part of the industry were able to adapt and were not badly affected zimbabwe botswana namibia zambia and malawi wanted to continue the ivory trade and were allowed to since their local elephant population were healthy but only if their supply were from elephant that had been culled or died of natural causesthe ban allowed the elephant to recover in part of africa in january elephant in bouba njida national park cameroon were killed by chadian raider this ha been called one of the worst concentrated killing since the ivory ban asian elephant are potentially le vulnerable to the ivory trade a female usually lack tusk still member of the specie have been killed for their ivory in some area such a periyar national park in india china wa the biggest market for poached ivory but announced they would phase out the legal domestic manufacture and sale of ivory product in may and in september china and the united state said they would enact a nearly complete ban on the import and export of ivory due to cause of extinctionother threat to elephant include habitat destruction and fragmentation the asian elephant life in area with some of the highest human population because they need larger amount of land than other sympatric terrestrial mammal they are the first to be affected by human encroachment in extreme case elephant may be confined to small island of forest among landscape elephant can not coexist with human in agricultural area due to their size and food requirement elephant commonly trample and consume crop which contributes to conflict with human and both elephant and human have died by the hundred a a result mitigating these conflict is important for conservation one proposed solution is the provision of corridor which allow the animal access to key area association with human working animal elephant have been working animal since at least the indus valley civilization and continue to be used in modern time there were working elephant employed in asia in these animal are typically captured from the wild when they are year old when they can be trained quickly and easily and will have a longer working life they were traditionally captured with trap and lasso but since tranquilliser have been usedindividuals of the asian specie have been often trained a working animal asian elephant perform task such a hauling load into remote area moving log to river and road transporting tourist around national park pulling wagon and leading religious procession in northern thailand the animal are used to digest coffee bean for black ivory coffee they are valued over mechanised tool because they can work in relatively deep water require relatively little maintenance need only vegetation and water a fuel and can be trained to memorise specific task elephant can be trained to respond to over command musth bull can be difficult and dangerous to work with and are chained and until the condition pass in india many working elephant are alleged to have been subject to abuse they and other captive elephant are thus protected under the prevention of cruelty to animal act of both myanmar and thailand deforestation and other economic factor have resulted in sizable population of unemployed elephant resulting in health problem for the elephant themselves a well a economic and safety problem for the people amongst whom they livethe practice of working elephant ha also been attempted in africa the taming of african elephant in the belgian congo began by decree of leopold ii of belgium during the century and continues to the present with the api elephant domestication centre warfare historically elephant were considered formidable instrument of war they were equipped with armour to protect their side and their tusk were given sharp point of iron or brass if they were large enough war elephant were trained to grasp an enemy soldier and toss him to the person riding on them or to pin the soldier to the ground and impale himone of the earliest reference to war elephant is in the indian epic mahabharata written in the century bc but said to describe event between the and century bc they were not used a much a chariot by either the pandavas or kauravas during the magadha kingdom which began in the century bc elephant began to achieve greater cultural importance than horse and later indian kingdom used war elephant extensively of them were used in the nandas and century bc army while may have been used in the mauryan army between the and century bc the arthashastra written around bc advised the mauryan government to reserve some forest for wild elephant for use in the army and to execute anyone who killed them from south asia the use of elephant in warfare spread west to persia and east to southeast asia the persian used them during the achaemenid empire between the and century bc while southeast asian state first used war elephant possibly a early a the century bc and continued to the centuryin his bc indian campaign alexander the great confronted elephant for the first time and suffered heavy casualty among the reason for the refusal of the macedonian soldier to continue the indian conquest were rumor of even larger elephant army in india alexander trained his foot soldier to injure the animal and cause them to panic during war with both the persian and indian ptolemy who wa one of alexander general used corp of asian elephant during his reign a the ruler of egypt which began in bc his son and successor ptolemy ii who began his rule in bc obtained his supply of elephant further south in nubia from then on war elephant were employed in the mediterranean and north africa throughout the classical period the greek king pyrrhus used elephant in his attempted invasion of rome in bc while they frightened the roman horse they were not decisive and pyrrhus ultimately lost the battle the carthaginian general hannibal took elephant across the alp during his war with the roman and reached the po valley in bc with all of them alive but they later succumbed to diseaseoverall elephant owed their initial success to the element of surprise and to the fear that their great size invoked with time strategist devised and war elephant turned into an expensive liability and were hardly ever used by roman and parthian zoo and circus elephant were historically kept for display in the menagerie of ancient egypt china greece and rome the roman in particular pitted them against human and other animal in gladiator event in the modern era elephant have traditionally been a major part of zoo and circus around the world in circus they are trained to perform trick the most famous circus elephant wa probably jumbo september who wa a major attraction in the barnum bailey circus these animal do not reproduce well in captivity due to the difficulty of handling musth bull and limited understanding of female oestrous cycle asian elephant were always more common than their african counterpart in modern zoo and circus after cite listed the asian elephant under appendix i in the number of african elephant in zoo increased in the although the import of asian continued subsequently the u received many of it captive african elephant from zimbabwe which had an overabundance of the animal a of around asian and african elephant were kept in zoo and circus the largest captive population is in north america which ha an estimated asian and african elephant about asian and african are known to exist in europe and japan ha around asian and africanskeeping elephant in zoo ha met with some controversy proponent of zoo argue that they offer researcher easy access to the animal and provide money and expertise for preserving their natural habitat a well a safekeeping for the specie critic claim that the animal in zoo are under physical and mental stress elephant have been recorded displaying stereotypical behaviour in the form of swaying back and forth trunk swaying or route tracing this ha been observed in of individual in uk zoo elephant in european zoo appear to have shorter lifespan than their wild counterpart at only year although other study suggest that zoo elephant live a long those in the wildthe use of elephant in circus ha also been controversial the humane society of the united state ha accused circus of mistreating and distressing their animal in testimony to a u federal court in barnum bailey circus ceo kenneth feld acknowledged that circus elephant are struck behind their ear under their chin and on their leg with prod called bull hook or ankus feld stated that these practice are necessary to protect circus worker and acknowledged that an elephant trainer wa reprimanded for using an electric shock device known a a hot shot or electric prod on an elephant despite this he denied that any of these practice harm elephant some trainer have tried to train elephant without the use of physical punishment ralph helfer is known to have relied on gentleness and reward when training his animal including elephant and lion ringling bros and barnum and bailey circus retired it touring elephant in may attack elephant can exhibit bout of aggressive behaviour and engage in destructive action against human in africa group of adolescent elephant damaged home in village after cullings in the and because of the timing these attack have been interpreted a vindictive in part of india male elephant regularly enter village at night destroying home and killing people elephant killed around people between and in jharkhand while in assam people were reportedly killed between and local people have reported their belief that some elephant were drunk during their attack although official have disputed this explanation purportedly drunk elephant attacked an indian village a second time

nurturance and loyalty several cultural reference emphasise the elephant size and exotic uniqueness for instance a white elephant is a byword for something expensive useless and bizarre the expression elephant in the room refers to an obvious truth that is ignored or otherwise unaddressed the story of the blind men and an elephant teach that reality can be observed from different perspectiveselephants have been represented in art since paleolithic time africa in particular contains many rock painting and engraving of the animal especially in the sahara and southern africa in asia the animal are depicted a motif in hindu and buddhist shrine and temple elephant were often difficult to portray by people with no experience of them the ancient roman who kept the animal in captivity depicted anatomically accurate elephant on mosaic in tunisia and sicily at the beginning of the middle age when european had little to no access to the animal elephant were portrayed more like fantasy creature they were often depicted with or body with trunk and tusk like a boar some were even given hoof elephant were commonly featured in motif by the stonemason of the gothic church a more elephant began to be sent to european king a gift during the century depiction of them became more accurate including one made by leonardo da vinci despite this some european continued to portray them in a more stylised fashion max ernst surrealist painting the elephant celebes depicts an elephant a a silo with a hose protruding from itelephants have been the subject of religious belief the mbuti people of central africa believe that the soul of their dead ancestor resided in elephant similar idea existed among other african society who believed that their chief would be reincarnated a
