the binturong arctictis binturong also known a bearcat is a viverrid native to south and southeast asia it is uncommon in much of it range and ha been assessed a vulnerable on the iucn red list because of a declining population trend that is estimated at more than since the mid binturong wa first described by thomas stamford raffle in the genus arctictis is monotypic and morphologically similar to the genus paradoxurus and paguma the name arctictis mean from greek iktis in riau indonesia it wa known a tenturun characteristic the binturong is long and heavy with short stout leg it ha a thick coat of coarse black hair the bushy and prehensile tail is thick at the root gradually tapering and curl inwards at the tip the muzzle is short and pointed somewhat turned up at the nose and is covered with bristly hair brown at the point which lengthen a they diverge and form a peculiar radiated circle round the face the eye are large black and prominent the ear are short rounded edged with white and terminated by tuft of black hair there are six short rounded incisor in each jaw two canine which are long and sharp and six molar on each side the hair on the leg is short and of a yellowish tinge the foot are with large strong claw the sol are bare and applied to the ground throughout the whole of their length the hind one are longer than the forein general build the binturong is essentially like paradoxurus and paguma but more massive in the length of the tail leg and foot in the structure of the scent gland and larger size of rhinarium which is more convex with a median groove being much narrower above the philtrum the contour hair of the coat are much longer and coarser and the long hair clothing the whole of the back of the ear project beyond the tip a a definite tuft the anterior bursa flap of the ear is more widely and le deeply emarginate the tail is more muscular especially at the base and in colour generally like the body but commonly paler at the base beneath the body hair are frequently partly whitish or buff giving a speckled appearance to the pelage sometimes so pale that the whole body is mostly or grey the young being often at all event paler than the adult but the head is always closely speckled with grey or buff the long mystacial vibrissa are conspicuously white and there is a white rim on the summit of the otherwise black ear the glandular area is whitish the tail is nearly a long a the head and body which range from to cm to in the tail is to cm to in long some captive binturong measured from cm ft in to cm ft in head and body with a tail of cm ft in mean weight of captive adult female is kg lb with a range from to kg to lb captive animal often weigh more than wild counterpartsboth sex have scent gland female on either side of the vulva and male between the scrotum and penis the musk gland emit an odor reminiscent of popcorn or corn chip likely due to the volatile compound in the urine which is also produced in the maillard reaction at high temperature unlike most other carnivorans the male binturong doe not have a baculum distribution and habitat the binturong occurs from india nepal bangladesh bhutan myanmar thailand malaysia to lao cambodia vietnam and yunnan in china and from sumatra kalimantan and java in indonesia to palawan in the philippine it is confined to tall forest in assam it is common in foothill and hill with good tree cover but le so in the forested plain it ha been recorded in manas national park in dulung and kakoi reserved forest of the lakhimpur district in the hill forest of karbi anglong north cachar hill cachar and hailakandi district in myanmar binturong were photographed on the ground in tanintharyi nature reserve at an elevation of m ft in the hukaung valley at elevation from m ft in the rakhine yoma elephant reserve at m ft and at three other site up to m ft elevation in thailand khao yai national park several individual were observed feeding in a fig tree and on a vine in lao they have been observed in extensive evergreen forest in malaysia binturong were recorded in secondary forest surrounding a palm estate that wa logged in the in palawan it inhabits primary and secondary lowland forest including mosaic from sea level to m ft taxonomy viverra binturong wa the scientific name proposed by thomas stamford raffle in for a specimen from malacca the generic name arctictis wa proposed by coenraad jacob temminck in in the and century the following zoological specimen were described paradoxurus albifrons proposed by frederic cuvier in wa based on a drawing of a binturong from bhutan prepared by alfred duvaucel arctictis penicillata by temminck in were specimen from sumatra and java arctictis whitei proposed by joel asaph allen in were skin of two female binturong collected in palawan island philippine arctictis pageli proposed by ernst schwarz in wa a skin and skull of a female collected in northern borneo arctictis gairdneri proposed by oldfield thomas in wa a skull of a male binturong collected in southwestern thailand arctictis niasensis proposed by marcus ward lyon jr in wa a binturong skin from nias island a b kerkhoveni by henri jacob victor sody in wa based on specimen from bangka island a b menglaensis by wang and li in wa based on specimen from yunnan provincenine subspecies have been recognized forming two clade the northern clade in mainland asia is separated from the sundaic clade by the isthmus of kra ecology and behavior the binturong is active during the day and at night three sighting in pakke tiger reserve were by day thirteen camera trap photograph event in myanmar involved one around dusk seven in full night and five in broad daylight all photograph were of single animal and all were taken on the ground a binturong are not very nimble they may have to descend to the ground relatively frequently when moving between treesfive binturong in the phu khieo wildlife sanctuary exhibited an arrhythmic activity dominated by crepuscular and nocturnal tendency with peak in the early morning and late evening reduced inactivity period occurred from midday to late afternoon they moved between m ft and m ft daily in the dry season and increased their daily movement to m ft in the wet season range size of male varied between sq mi and sq mi two male showed slightly larger range in the wet season their range overlapped between the average home range of a female in the khao yai national park wa estimated at sq mi and the one of a male at to to sq mi the binturong is essentially arboreal pocock observed the behaviour of several captive individual in the london zoological garden when resting they lie curled up with the head tucked under the tail they seldom leaped but climbed skillfully albeit slowly progressing with equal ease and confidence along the upper side of branch or upside down beneath them the prehensile tail wa always ready a a help they descended the vertical bar of the cage head first gripping them between their paw and using the prehensile tail a a check when irritated they growled fiercely when on the prowl they periodically uttered a series of low grunt or a hissing sound made by expelling air through partially opened lipsthe binturong us the tail to communicate it move about gently often coming to a stop and often using the tail to keep balance clinging to a branch it show a pronounced comfort behaviour associated with grooming the fur shaking and licking the hair and scratching shaking is the most characteristic element of comfort behaviourthe specie is normally quite shy but aggressive when harassed it is reported to initially urinate or defecate on a threat and then if and snarling doe not deter the threat it us it powerful jaw and teeth in when threatened the binturong will usually flee into a nearby tree but a a defense mechanism the binturong may sometimes balance on it tail and flash it claw to appear threatening to potential predator predation on adult binturong is reportedly quite rare by sympatric specie like leopard clouded leopard and reticulated python diet the binturong is omnivorous feeding on small mammal bird fish earthworm insect and fruit it also prey on rodent fish and earthworm are likely unimportant item in it diet a it is neither aquatic nor fossorial coming across such prey only when opportunity present themselves since it doe not have the attribute of a predatory mammal most of the binturong diet is probably of vegetable matter fig are a major component of it diet captive binturong are particularly fond of plantain but also eat fowl head and eggsthe binturong is an important agent for seed dispersal especially for those of the strangler fig because of it ability to scarify the seed tough outer coveringin captivity the binturong diet includes commercially prepared meat mix banana apple orange canned peach and mineral supplement reproduction the average age of sexual maturation is month for female and month for male the estrous cycle of the binturong last to day with an average of day gestation last to day litter size in captivity varies from one to six young with an average of two young per birth neonate weigh between and g and lb and are often referred to a shruggles fertility last until year of agethe maximum known lifespan in captivity is thought to be over year of age threat major threat to the binturong are habitat loss and degradation of forest through logging and conversion of forest to throughout the binturong range habitat loss ha been severe in the lowland of the sundaic part of it range and there is no evidence that the binturong us the plantation that are largely replacing natural forest in china rampant deforestation and opportunistic logging practice have fragmented suitable habitat or eliminated site altogether in the philippine it is captured for the wildlife trade and in the south of it range it is also taken for human consumption in lao it is one of the most frequently displayed caged live carnivore and skin are traded frequently in at least vientiane in part of lao it is considered a delicacy and also traded a a food item to vietnamthe orang asli of malaysia keep binturong a pet conservation india included the binturong in cite appendix iii and in schedule i of the wild life protection act so that it ha the highest level of protection in china it is listed a critically endangered it is completely protected in bangladesh and partially in thailand malaysia and vietnam licensed hunting of binturong is allowed in indonesia and it is not protected in bruneiworld binturong day an event dedicated to binturong awareness and conservation take place yearly every second saturday of may in captivity binturong are common in zoo and captive individual represent a source of genetic diversity essential for conservation their geographic origin is either usually unknown or they are offspring of several
