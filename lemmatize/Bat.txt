bat are mammal of the order chiroptera with their forelimb adapted a wing they are the only mammal capable of true and sustained flight bat are more manoeuvrable than bird flying with their very long digit covered with a thin membrane or patagium the smallest bat and arguably the smallest extant mammal is kitti bat which is millimetre inch in length mm in across the wing and g oz in mass the largest bat are the flying fox and the giant flying fox acerodon jubatus which can weigh kg lb and have a wingspan of m ft in the second largest order of mammal after rodent bat comprise about of all classified mammal specie worldwide with over specie these were traditionally divided into two suborder the largely megabat and the echolocating microbat but more recent evidence ha supported dividing the order into yinpterochiroptera and yangochiroptera with megabat a member of the former along with several specie of microbat many bat are insectivore and most of the rest are frugivores or nectarivores a few specie feed on animal other than insect for example the vampire bat feed on blood most bat are nocturnal and many roost in cave or other refuge it is uncertain whether bat have these behaviour to escape predator bat are present throughout the world with the exception of extremely cold region they are important in their ecosystem for pollinating flower and dispersing seed many tropical plant depend entirely on bat for these service bat provide human with some direct benefit at the cost of some disadvantage on the benefit side bat dung ha been and in many place still is mined a guano from cave and used a fertiliser bat consume insect pest reducing the need for pesticide and other insect management measure they are sometimes numerous enough and close enough to human settlement to serve a tourist attraction and they are used a food across asia and the pacific rim on the disadvantage side fruit bat are frequently considered a pest by fruit grower due to their physiology bat are one type of animal that act a a natural reservoir of many pathogen such a rabies and since they are highly mobile social and they can readily spread disease among themselves if human interact with bat these trait become potentially dangerous to human depending on the culture bat may be symbolically associated with positive trait such a protection from certain disease or risk rebirth or long life but in the west bat are popularly associated with darkness malevolence witchcraft vampire and death etymology an older english name for bat is flittermouse which match their name in other germanic language for example german fledermaus and swedish fladdermus related to the fluttering of wing middle english had bakke most likely cognate with old swedish natbakka which may have undergone a shift from to to modern english bat influenced by latin blatta moth nocturnal insect the word bat wa probably first used in the early the name chiroptera derives from ancient greek kheir cheir hand and pteron pteron wing phylogeny and taxonomy evolution the delicate skeleton of bat do not fossilise well and it is estimated that only of bat genus that lived have been found in the fossil record most of the oldest known bat fossil were already very similar to modern microbat such a archaeopteropus million year ago the extinct bat palaeochiropteryx tupaiodon million year ago and hassianycteris kumari million year ago are the first fossil mammal whose colouration ha been discovered both were were formerly grouped in the superorder archonta along with the treeshrews scandentia colugo dermoptera and primate modern genetic evidence now place bat in the superorder laurasiatheria with it sister taxon a fereuungulata which includes carnivorans pangolin ungulate ungulate and cetacean one study place chiroptera a a sister taxon to ungulate perissodactyla the phylogenetic relationship of the different group of bat have been the subject of much debate the traditional subdivision into megachiroptera and microchiroptera reflected the view that these group of bat had evolved independently of each other for a long time from a common ancestor already capable of flight this hypothesis recognised difference between microbat and megabat and acknowledged that flight ha evolved only once in mammal most molecular biological evidence support the view that bat form a natural or monophyletic group genetic evidence indicates that megabat originated during the early eocene and belong within the four major line of microbat two new suborder have been proposed yinpterochiroptera includes the pteropodidae or megabat family a well a the family rhinolophidae hipposideridae craseonycteridae megadermatidae and rhinopomatidae yangochiroptera includes the other family of bat all of which use laryngeal echolocation a conclusion supported by a dna study a phylogenomic study supported the two new proposed suborder in the a hypothesis based on morphological evidence stated the megachiroptera evolved flight separately from the microchiroptera the flying primate hypothesis proposed that when adaptation to flight are removed the megachiroptera are allied to primate by anatomical feature not shared with microchiroptera for example the brain of megabat have advanced characteristic although recent genetic study strongly support the monophyly of bat debate continues about the meaning of the genetic and morphological evidencethe discovery of an early fossil bat from the green river formation onychonycteris finneyi indicates that flight evolved before echolocative ability onychonycteris had claw on all five of it finger whereas modern bat have at most two claw on two digit of each hand it also had longer hind leg and shorter forearm similar to climbing mammal that hang under branch such a sloth and gibbon this bat had short broad wing suggesting that it could not fly a fast or a far a later bat specie instead of flapping it wing continuously while flying onychonycteris probably alternated between flap and glide in the air this suggests that this bat did not fly a much a modern bat but flew from tree to tree and spent most of it time climbing or hanging on branch the distinctive feature of the onychonycteris fossil also support the hypothesis that mammalian flight most likely evolved in arboreal locomotors rather than terrestrial runner this model of flight development commonly known a the theory hold that bat first flew by taking advantage of height and gravity to drop down on to prey rather than running fast enough for a take offthe molecular phylogeny wa controversial a it pointed to microbat not having a unique common ancestry which implied that some seemingly unlikely transformation occurred the first is that laryngeal echolocation evolved twice in bat once in yangochiroptera and once in the rhinolophoids the second is that laryngeal echolocation had a single origin in chiroptera wa subsequently lost in the family pteropodidae all megabat and later evolved a a system of in the genus rousettus analysis of the sequence of the vocalization gene were inconclusive on whether laryngeal echolocation wa lost in the pteropodids or gained in the echolocating lineage echolocation probably first derived in bat from communicative call the eocene bat icaronycteris million year ago and palaeochiropteryx had cranial adaptation suggesting an ability to detect ultrasound this may have been used at first mainly to forage on the ground for insect and map out their surroundings in their gliding phase or for communicative purpose after the adaptation of flight wa established it may have been refined to target flying prey by echolocation bat may have evolved echolocation through a shared common ancestor in which case it wa then lost in the old world megabat only to be regained in the horseshoe bat or echolocation evolved independently in both the yinpterochiroptera and yangochiroptera lineage analysis of the hearing gene prestin seem to favour the idea that echolocation developed independently at least twice rather than being lost secondarily in the pteropodids but ontogenic analysis of the cochlea support that laryngeal echolocation evolved only once classification bat are placental mammal after rodent they are the largest order making up about of mammal specie in carl linnaeus classified the seven bat specie he knew of in the genus vespertilio in the order primate around twenty year later the german naturalist johann friedrich blumenbach gave them their own order chiroptera since then the number of described specie ha risen to over traditionally classified a two suborder megachiroptera megabat and microchiroptera bat not all megabat are larger than microbat several characteristic distinguish the two group microbat use echolocation for navigation and finding prey but megabat apart from those in the genus rousettus do not relying instead on their eyesight accordingly megabat have a visual cortex and good visual acuity megabat have a claw on the second finger of the forelimb the external ear of microbat do not close to form a ring the edge are separated from each other at the base of the ear megabat eat fruit nectar or pollen while most microbat eat insect others feed on fruit nectar pollen fish frog small mammal or blood below is a table chart following the bat classification of family recognized by various author of the ninth volume of handbook of the mammal of the world published in anatomy and physiology skull and dentition the head and teeth shape of bat can vary by specie in general megabat have longer snout larger eye socket and smaller ear giving them a more appearance which is the source of their nickname of flying fox among microbat longer snout are associated with while vampire bat have reduced snout to accommodate large incisor and caninessmall bat can have a many a teeth while vampire bat have only bat that feed on insect have fewer but larger teeth with longer canine and more robust lower jaw than specie that prey on softer bodied insect in bat the canine are long while the are reduced in bat the cusp of the cheek teeth are adapted for crushing these feeding behaviour are true for both megabat and microbat the upper incisor of vampire bat lack enamel which keep them the bite force of small bat is generated through mechanical advantage allowing them to bite through the hardened armour of insect or the skin of fruit wing and flight bat are the only mammal capable of sustained flight a opposed to gliding a in the flying squirrel the fastest bat the mexican bat tadarida brasiliensis can achieve a ground speed of mph the finger bone of bat are much more flexible than those of other mammal owing to their flattened and to low level of calcium near their tip the elongation of bat digit a key feature required for wing development is due to the upregulation of bone morphogenetic protein bmps during embryonic development the gene controlling bmp signalling is subjected to increased expression in bat in the extension of the manual digit this crucial genetic alteration help create the specialised limb required for powered flight the relative proportion of extant bat forelimb digit compared with those of eocene fossil bat have no significant difference suggesting that bat wing morphology ha been conserved for over million year during flight the bone undergo bending and shearing stress the bending stress felt are smaller than in terrestrial mammal but the shearing stress is larger the wing bone of bat have a slightly lower breaking stress point than those of birdsas in other mammal and unlike in bird the radius is the main component of the forearm bat have five elongated digit which all radiate around the wrist the thumb point forward and support the leading edge of the wing and the other digit support the tension held in the wing membrane the second and third digit go along the wing tip allowing the wing to be pulled forward against aerodynamic drag without having to be thick a in pterosaur wing the fourth and fifth digit go from the wrist to the trailing edge and repel the bending force caused by air pushing up against the stiff membrane due to their flexible joint bat are more manoeuvrable and more dexterous than gliding mammal the wing of bat are much thinner and consist of more bone than the wing of bird allowing bat to manoeuvre more accurately than the latter and fly with more lift and le drag by folding the wing in toward their body on the upstroke they save percent energy during flight the membrane are delicate tearing easily but can regrow and small tear heal quickly the surface of the wing is equipped with receptor on small bump called merkel cell also found on human fingertip these sensitive area are different in bat a each bump ha a tiny hair in the centre making it even more sensitive and allowing the bat to detect and adapt to changing airflow the primary use is to judge the most efficient speed to fly at and possibly also to avoid stall insectivorous bat may also use tactile hair to help perform complex manoeuvre to capture prey in flight the patagium is the wing membrane it is stretched between the arm and finger bone and down the side of the body to the hind limb and tail this skin membrane consists of connective tissue elastic fibre nerve muscle and blood vessel the muscle keep the membrane taut during flight the extent to which the tail of a bat is attached to a patagium can vary by specie with some having completely free tail or even no tail the skin on the body of the bat which ha one layer of epidermis and dermis a well a hair follicle sweat gland and a fatty subcutaneous layer is very different from the skin of the wing membrane the patagium is an extremely thin double layer of epidermis these layer are separated by a connective tissue centre rich with collagen and elastic fibre the membrane ha no hair follicle or sweat gland except between the finger for bat embryo apoptosis cell death affect only the hindlimb while the forelimb retain webbing between the digit that form into the wing membrane unlike bird whose stiff wing deliver bending and torsional stress to the shoulder bat have a flexible wing membrane that can only resist tension to achieve flight a bat exerts force inwards at the point where the membrane meet the skeleton so that an opposing force balance it on the wing edge perpendicular to the wing surface this adaptation doe not permit bat to reduce their wingspan unlike bird which can partly fold their wing in flight radically reducing the wing span and area for the upstroke and for gliding hence bat can not travel over long distance a bird and bat can hover in a similar way to hummingbird the sharp leading edge of the wing can create vortex which provide lift the vortex may be stabilised by the animal changing it wing curvature roosting and gait when not flying bat hang upside down from their foot a posture known a roosting the femur are attached at the hip in a way that allows them to bend outward and upward in flight the ankle joint can flex to allow the trailing edge of the wing to bend downwards this doe not permit many movement other than hanging or clambering up tree most megabat roost with the head tucked towards the belly whereas most microbat roost with the neck curled towards the back this difference is reflected in the structure of the cervical or neck vertebra in the two group which are clearly distinct tendon allow bat to lock their foot closed when hanging from a roost muscular power is needed to let go but not to grasp a perch or when holding onwhen on the ground most bat can only crawl awkwardly a few specie such a the new zealand lesser bat and the common vampire bat are agile on the ground both specie make lateral gait the limb move one after the other when moving slowly but vampire bat move with a bounding gait all limb move in unison at greater speed the folded up wing being used to propel them forward vampire bat likely evolved these gait to follow their host while bat developed in the absence of terrestrial mammal competitor enhanced terrestrial locomotion doe not appear to have reduced their ability to fly internal system bat have an efficient circulatory system they seem to make use of particularly strong venomotion a rhythmic contraction of venous wall muscle in most mammal the wall of the vein provide mainly passive resistance maintaining their shape a deoxygenated blood flow through them but in bat they appear to actively support blood flow back to the heart with this pumping action since their body are relatively small and lightweight bat are not at risk of blood flow rushing to their head when roostingbats posse a highly adapted respiratory system to cope with the demand of powered flight an energetically taxing activity that requires a large continuous throughput of oxygen in bat the relative alveolar surface area and pulmonary capillary blood volume are larger than in most other small quadrupedal mammal during flight the respiratory cycle ha a relationship with the cycle because of the restraint of the mammalian lung bat can not maintain flight it take a lot of energy and an efficient circulatory system to work the flight muscle of bat energy supply to the muscle engaged in flight require about double the amount compared to the muscle that do not use flight a a mean of mammalian locomotion in parallel to energy consumption blood oxygen level of flying animal are twice a much a those of their terrestrially locomoting mammal a the blood supply control the amount of oxygen supplied throughout the body the circulatory system must respond accordingly therefore compared to a terrestrial mammal of the same relative size the bat heart can be up to three time larger and pump more blood cardiac output is directly derived from heart rate and stroke volume of the blood an active microbat can reach a heart rate of beat per minutewith it extremely thin membranous tissue a bat wing can significantly contribute to the organism total gas exchange efficiency because of the high energy demand of flight the bat body meet those demand by exchanging gas through the patagium of the wing when the bat ha it wing spread it allows for an increase in surface area to volume ratio the surface area of the wing is about of the total body surface area suggesting the possibility of a useful degree of gas exchange the subcutaneous vessel in the membrane lie very close to the surface and allow for the diffusion of oxygen and carbon dioxidethe digestive system of bat ha varying adaptation depending on the specie of bat and it diet a in other flying animal food is processed quickly and effectively to keep up with the energy demand insectivorous bat may have certain digestive enzyme to better process insect such a chitinase to break down chitin which is a large component of insect vampire bat probably due to their diet of blood are the only vertebrate that do not have the enzyme maltase which break down malt sugar in their intestinal tract nectivorous and frugivorous bat have more maltase and sucrase enzyme than insectivorous to cope with the higher sugar content of their dietthe adaptation of the kidney of bat vary with their diet carnivorous and vampire bat consume large amount of protein and can output concentrated urine their kidney have a thin cortex and long renal papilla frugivorous bat lack that ability and have kidney adapted for due to their diet their kidney accordingly have a thick cortex and very short conical papilla bat have higher metabolic rate associated with flying which lead to an increased respiratory water loss their large wing are composed of the highly vascularized membrane increasing the surface area and leading to cutaneous evaporative water loss water help maintain their ionic balance in their blood thermoregulation system and removal of waste and toxin from the body via urine they are also susceptible to blood urea poisoning if they do not receive enough fluidthe structure of the uterine system in female bat can vary by specie with some having two uterine horn while others have a single mainline chamber sens echolocation microbat and a few megabat emit ultrasonic sound to produce echo sound intensity of these echo are dependent on subglottic pressure the bat cricothyroid muscle control the orientation pulse frequency which is an important function this muscle is located inside the larynx and it is the only tensor muscle capable of aiding phonation by comparing the outgoing pulse with the returning echo the brain and auditory nervous system can produce detailed image of the bat surroundings this allows bat to detect localise and classify their prey in darkness bat call are some of the loudest airborne animal sound and can range in intensity from to decibel microbat use their larynx to create ultrasound and emit it through the mouth and sometimes the nose the latter is most pronounced in the horseshoe bat rhinolophus spp microbat call range in frequency from to well over hz extending well beyond the range of human hearing between and hz various group of bat have evolved fleshy extension around and above the nostril known a which play a role in sound transmission in cycle echolocation bat can separate their call and returning echo by time they have to time their short call to finish before echo return bat contract their middle ear muscle when emitting a call so they can avoid deafening themselves the time interval between the call and echo allows them to relax these muscle so they can hear the returning echo the delay of the returning echo allows the bat to estimate the range to their preyin cycle echolocation bat emit a continuous call and separate pulse and echo in frequency the ear of these bat are sharply tuned to a specific frequency range they emit call outside this range to avoid deafening themselves they then receive echo back at the finely tuned frequency range by taking advantage of the doppler shift of their motion in flight the doppler shift of the returning echo yield information relating to the motion and location of the bat prey these bat must deal with change in the doppler shift due to change in their flight speed they have adapted to change their pulse emission frequency in relation to their flight speed so echo still return in the optimal hearing rangein addition to echolocating prey bat ear are sensitive to the fluttering of moth wing the sound produced by tymbalate insect and the movement of prey such a centipede and earwig the complex geometry of ridge on the inner surface of bat ear help to sharply focus echolocation signal and to passively listen for any other sound produced by the prey these ridge can be regarded a the acoustic equivalent of a fresnel lens and exist in a large variety of unrelated animal such a the lesser galago fox mouse lemur and others bat can estimate the elevation of their target using the interference pattern from the echo reflecting from the tragus a flap of skin in the external ear by repeated scanning bat can mentally construct an accurate image of the environment in which they are moving and of their prey some specie of moth have exploited this such a the tiger moth which produce aposematic ultrasound signal to warn bat that they are chemically protected and therefore distasteful moth specie including the tiger moth can produce signal to jam bat echolocation many moth specie have a hearing organ called a tympanum which responds to an incoming bat signal by causing the moth flight muscle to twitch erratically sending the moth into random evasive manoeuvre vision the eye of most microbat specie are small and poorly developed leading to poor visual acuity but no specie is blind most microbat have mesopic vision meaning that they can only detect light in low level whereas other mammal have photopic vision which allows colour vision microbat may use their vision for orientation and while travelling between their roosting ground and feeding ground a echolocation is only effective over short distance some specie can detect ultraviolet uv a the body of some microbat have distinct coloration they may be able to discriminate coloursmegabat specie often have eyesight a good a if not better than human vision their eyesight is adapted to both night and daylight vision including some colour vision magnetoreception microbat make use of magnetoreception in that they have a high sensitivity to the earth magnetic field a bird do microbat use a compass meaning that they differentiate north from south unlike bird which use the strength of the magnetic field to differentiate latitude which may be used in travel the mechanism is unknown but may involve magnetite particle thermoregulation most bat are homeothermic having a stable body temperature the exception being the vesper bat vespertilionidae the horseshoe bat rhinolophidae the bat molossidae and the bat miniopteridae which extensively use heterothermy where body temperature can vary compared to other mammal bat have a high thermal conductivity the wing are filled with blood vessel and lose body heat when extended at rest they may wrap their wing around themselves to trap a layer of warm air smaller bat generally have a higher metabolic rate than larger bat and so need to consume more food in order to maintain homeothermybats may avoid flying during the day to prevent overheating in the sun since their dark absorb solar radiation bat may not be able to dissipate heat if the ambient temperature is too high they use saliva to cool themselves in extreme condition among megabat the flying fox pteropus hypomelanus us saliva and to cool itself while roosting during the hottest part of the day among microbat the yuma myotis myotis yumanensis the mexican bat and the pallid bat antrozous pallidus cope with temperature up to by panting salivating and licking their fur to promote evaporative cooling this is sufficient to dissipate twice their metabolic heat productionbats also posse a system of sphincter valve on the arterial side of the vascular network that run along the edge of their wing when fully open these allow oxygenated blood to flow through the capillary network across the wing membrane when contracted they shunt flow directly to the vein bypassing the wing capillary this allows bat to control how much heat is exchanged through the flight membrane allowing them to release heat during flight many other mammal use the capillary network in oversized ear for the same purpose torpor torpor a state of decreased activity where the body temperature and metabolism decrease is especially useful for microbat a they use a large amount of energy while active depend upon an unreliable food source and have a limited ability to store fat they generally drop their body temperature in this state to and may reduce their energy expenditure by to around of all microbat use torpor tropical bat may use it to avoid predation by reducing the amount of time spent on foraging and thus reducing the chance of being caught by a predator megabat were generally believed to be homeothermic but three specie of small megabat with a mass of about gram ounce have been known to use torpor the common blossom bat syconycteris australis the nectar bat macroglossus minimus and the eastern bat nyctimene robinsoni torpid state last longer in the summer for megabat than in the winterduring hibernation bat enter a torpid state and decrease their body temperature for of their hibernation period even during period of arousal when they return their body temperature to normal they sometimes enter a shallow torpid state known a heterothermic arousal some bat become dormant during higher temperature to keep cool in the summer monthsheterothermic bat during long migration may fly at night and go into a torpid state roosting in the daytime unlike migratory bird which fly during the day and feed during the night nocturnal bat have a conflict between travelling and eating the energy saved reduces their need to feed and also decrease the duration of migration which may prevent them from spending too much time in unfamiliar place and decrease predation in some specie pregnant individual may not use torpor size the smallest bat is kitti bat craseonycteris thonglongyai which is mm in long with a in wingspan and weighs g oz it is also arguably the smallest extant specie of mammal next to the etruscan shrew the largest bat are a few specie of pteropus megabat and the giant flying fox acerodon jubatus which can weigh kg lb with a wingspan of m ft in larger bat tend to use lower frequency and smaller bat higher for echolocation echolocation is better at detecting smaller prey small prey may be absent in the diet of large bat a they are unable to detect them the adaptation of a particular bat specie can directly influence what kind of prey are available to it ecology flight ha enabled bat to become one of the most widely distributed group of mammal apart from the high arctic the antarctic and a few isolated oceanic island bat exist in almost every habitat on earth tropical area tend to have more specie than temperate one different specie select different habitat during different season ranging from seaside to mountain and desert but they require suitable roost bat roost can be found in hollow crevice foliage and even structure and include tent the bat construct with leaf megabat generally roost in tree most microbat are nocturnal and megabat are typically diurnal or crepuscularin temperate area some microbat migrate hundred of kilometre to winter hibernation den others pas into torpor in cold weather rousing and feeding when warm weather allows insect to be active others retreat to cave for winter and hibernate for a much a six month microbat rarely fly in rain it interferes with their echolocation and they are unable to hunt food and feeding different bat specie have different diet including insect nectar pollen fruit and even vertebrate megabat are mostly fruit nectar and pollen eater due to their small size and rapid burning of energy through flight bat must consume large amount of food for their size insectivorous bat may eat over percent of their body weight while frugivorous bat may eat over twice their weight they can travel significant distance each night exceptionally a much a km mi in the spotted bat euderma maculatum in search of food bat use a variety of hunting strategy bat get most of their water from the food they eat many specie also drink from water source like lake and stream flying over the surface and dipping their tongue into the waterthe chiroptera a a whole are in the process of losing the ability to synthesise vitamin c in a test of bat specie from six major family including major and bat family all were found to have lost the ability to synthesise it and this loss may derive from a common bat ancestor a a single mutation at least two specie of bat the frugivorous bat rousettus leschenaultii and the insectivorous bat hipposideros armiger have retained their ability to produce vitamin c insect most microbat especially in temperate area prey on insect the diet of an insectivorous bat may span many specie including fly mosquito beetle moth grasshopper cricket termite bee wasp mayfly and caddisflies large number of mexican bat tadarida brasiliensis fly hundred of metre above the ground in central texas to feed on migrating moth specie that hunt insect in flight like the little brown bat myotis lucifugus may catch an insect in with the mouth and eat it in the air or use their tail membrane or wing to scoop up the insect and carry it to the mouth the bat may also take the insect back to it roost and eat it there slower moving bat specie such a the brown bat plecotus auritus and many horseshoe bat specie may take or glean insect from vegetation or hunt them from perch insectivorous bat living at high latitude have to consume prey with higher energetic value than tropical bat fruit and nectar fruit eating or frugivory is found in both major suborder bat prefer ripe fruit pulling it off the tree with their teeth they fly back to their roost to eat the fruit sucking out the juice and spitting the seed and pulp out onto the ground this help disperse the seed of these fruit tree which may take root and grow where the bat have left them and many specie of plant depend on bat for seed dispersal the jamaican fruit bat artibeus jamaicensis ha been recorded carrying fruit weighing g oz or even a much a g oz bat have acquired specialised adaptation these bat posse long muzzle and long extensible tongue covered in fine bristle that aid them in feeding on particular flower and plant the nectar bat anoura fistulata ha the longest tongue of any mammal relative to it body size this is beneficial to them in term of pollination and feeding their long narrow tongue can reach deep into the long cup shape of some flower when the tongue retracts it coil up inside the rib cage because of these feature bat can not easily turn to other food source in time of scarcity making them more prone to extinction than other type of bat nectar feeding also aid a variety of plant since these bat serve a pollinator a pollen get attached to their fur while they are feeding around specie of flowering plant rely on bat pollination and thus tend to open their flower at night many rainforest plant depend on bat pollination vertebrate some bat prey on other vertebrate such a fish frog lizard bird and mammal the bat trachops cirrhosus for example is skilled at catching frog these bat locate large group of frog by tracking their mating call then plucking them from the surface of the water with their sharp canine teeth the greater noctule bat can catch bird in flight some specie like the greater bulldog bat noctilio leporinus hunt fish they use echolocation to detect small ripple on the water surface swoop down and use specially enlarged claw on their hind foot to grab the fish then take their prey to a feeding roost and consume it at least two specie of bat are known to feed on other bat the spectral bat vampyrum spectrum and the ghost bat macroderma gigas blood a few specie specifically the common and vampire bat only feed on animal blood hematophagy the common vampire bat typically feed on large mammal such a cattle the and vampire feed on bird vampire bat target sleeping prey and can detect deep breathing heat sensor in the nose help them to detect blood vessel near the surface of the skin they pierce the animal skin with their teeth biting away a small flap and lap up the blood with their tongue which have lateral groove adapted to this purpose the blood is kept from clotting by an anticoagulant in the saliva predator parasite and disease bat are subject to predation from bird of prey such a owl hawk and falcon and at roost from terrestrial predator able to climb such a cat twenty specie of tropical new world snake are known to capture bat often waiting at the entrance of refuge such a cave for bat to fly past j rydell and j r speakman argue that bat evolved nocturnality during the early and middle eocene period to avoid predator the evidence is thought by some zoologist to be equivocal so far among ectoparasite bat carry flea and mite a well a specific parasite such a bat bug and bat fly nycteribiidae and streblidae bat are among the few mammalian order that do not host louse possibly due to competition from more specialised parasite that occupy the same nichewhite nose syndrome is a condition associated with the death of million of bat in the eastern united state and canada the disease is named after a white fungus pseudogymnoascus destructans found growing on the muzzle ear and wing of afflicted bat the fungus is mostly spread from bat to bat and cause the disease the fungus wa first discovered in central new york state in and spread quickly to the entire eastern u north of florida mortality rate of have been observed in most affected cave new england and the state have since witnessed entire specie completely extirpated and others with number that have gone from the hundred of thousand even million to a few hundred or le nova scotia quebec ontario and new brunswick have witnessed identical die offs with the canadian government making preparation to protect all remaining bat population in it territory scientific evidence suggests that longer winter where the fungus ha a longer period to infect bat result in greater mortality in the infection crossed the mississippi river and in it wa found on bat in texasbats are natural reservoir for a large number of zoonotic pathogen including rabies endemic in many bat population histoplasmosis both directly and in guano nipah and hendra virus and possibly the ebola virus whose natural reservoir is yet unknown their high mobility broad distribution long life span substantial sympatry range overlap of specie and social behaviour make bat favourable host and vector of disease review have found different answer a to whether bat have more zoonotic virus than other mammal group one review found that bat rodent and primate all harbored significantly more zoonotic virus which can be transmitted to human than other mammal group though the difference among the aforementioned three group were not significant bat have no more zoonotic virus than rodent and primate another review of mammal and bird found that the identify of the taxonomic group did not have any impact on the probability of harboring zoonotic virus instead more diverse group had greater viral diversitythey seem to be highly resistant to many of the pathogen they carry suggesting a degree of adaptation to their immune system their interaction with livestock and pet including predation by vampire bat accidental encounter and the scavenging of bat carcass compound the risk of zoonotic transmission bat are implicated in the emergence of severe acute respiratory syndrome sars in china since they serve a natural host for coronaviruses several from a single cave in yunnan one of which developed into the sars virus however they do neither cause nor spread behaviour and life history social structure some bat lead solitary life while others live in colony of more than a million living in large colony lessens the risk to an individual of predation temperate bat specie may swarm at hibernation site a autumn approach this may serve to introduce young to hibernation site signal reproduction in adult and allow adult to breed with those from other groupsseveral specie have a social structure where large number of bat congregate in one roosting area along with breaking up and mixing of subgroup within these society bat are able to maintain relationship some of these relationship consist of matrilineally related female and their dependent offspring food sharing and mutual grooming may occur in certain specie such a the common vampire bat desmodus rotundus and these strengthen social bond communication bat are among the most vocal of mammal and produce call to attract mate find roost partner and defend resource these call are typically and can travel long distance mexican bat are one of the few specie to sing like bird male sing to attract female song have three phrase chirp trill and buzz the former having a and b syllable bat song are highly stereotypical but with variation in syllable number phrase order and phrase repetition between individual among greater bat phyllostomus hastatus female produce loud broadband call among their roost mate to form group cohesion call differ between roosting group and may arise from vocal learningin a study on captive egyptian fruit bat of the directed call could be identified by the researcher a to which individual bat made it and could be categorised into four context squabbling over food jostling over position in their sleeping cluster protesting over mating attempt and arguing when perched in close proximity to each other the animal made slightly different sound when communicating with different individual bat especially those of the opposite sex in the highly sexually dimorphic bat hypsignathus monstrosus male produce deep resonating monotonous call to attract female bat in flight make vocal signal for traffic control greater bulldog bat honk when on a collision course with each otherbats also communicate by other mean male little bat sturnira lilium have shoulder gland that produce a spicy odour during the breeding season like many other specie they have hair specialised for retaining and dispersing secretion such hair form a conspicuous collar around the neck of the some old world megabat male male greater bat saccopteryx bilineata have sac in their wing in which they mix body secretion like saliva and urine to create a perfume that they sprinkle on roost site a behaviour known a salting salting may be accompanied by singing reproduction and lifecycle most bat specie are polygynous where male mate with multiple female male pipistrelle noctule and vampire bat may claim and defend resource that attract female such a roost site and mate with those female male unable to claim a site are forced to live on the periphery where they have le reproductive success promiscuity where both sex mate with multiple partner exists in specie like the mexican bat and the little brown bat there appears to be bias towards certain male among female in these bat in a few specie such a the bat and spectral bat adult male and female form monogamous pair lek mating where male aggregate and compete for female choice through display is rare in bat but occurs in the hammerheaded batfor temperate living bat mating take place in late summer and early autumn tropical bat may mate during the dry season after copulation the male may leave behind a mating plug to block the sperm of other male and thus ensure his paternity in hibernating specie male are known to mate with female in torpor female bat use a variety of strategy to control the timing of pregnancy and the birth of young to make delivery coincide with maximum food ability and other ecological factor female of some specie have delayed fertilisation in which sperm is stored in the reproductive tract for several month after mating mating occurs in the autumn but fertilisation doe not occur until the following spring other specie exhibit delayed implantation in which the egg is fertilised after mating but remains free in the reproductive tract until external condition become favourable for giving birth and caring for the offspring in another strategy fertilisation and implantation both occur but development of the foetus is delayed until good condition prevail during the delayed development the mother keep the fertilised egg alive with nutrient this process can go on for a long period because of the advanced gas exchange system for temperate living bat birth typically take place in may or june in the northern hemisphere birth in the southern hemisphere occur in november and december tropical specie give birth at the beginning of the rainy season in most bat specie female carry and give birth to a single pup per litter at birth a bat pup can be up to percent of the mother weight and the pelvic girdle of the female can expand during birth a the two half are connected by a flexible ligament female typically give birth in a or horizontal position using gravity to make birthing easier the young emerges possibly to prevent the wing from getting tangled and the female cradle it in her wing and tail membrane in many specie female give birth and raise their young in maternity colony and may assist each other in birthingmost of the care for a young bat come from the mother in monogamous specie the father play a role where a female suckles another mother young occurs in several specie this may serve to increase colony size in specie where female return to their natal colony to breed a young bat ability to fly coincides with the development of an adult body and forelimb length for the little brown bat this occurs about eighteen day after birth weaning of young for most specie take place in under eighty day the common vampire bat nurse it offspring beyond that and young vampire bat achieve independence later in life than other specie this is probably due to the specie diet which is difficult to obtain on a nightly basis life expectancy the maximum lifespan of bat is time longer than other mammal of similar size six specie have been recorded to live over year in the wild the brown bat plecotus auritus the little brown bat myotis lucifugus brandt bat myotis brandti the lesser bat myotis blythii the greater horseshoe bat rhinolophus ferrumequinum and the indian flying fox pteropus giganteus one hypothesis consistent with the theory link this to the fact that they slow down their metabolic rate while hibernating bat that hibernate on average have a longer lifespan than bat that do not another hypothesis is that flying ha reduced their mortality rate which would also be true for bird and gliding mammal bat specie that give birth to multiple pup generally have a shorter lifespan than specie that give birth to only a single pup specie may have a longer lifespan than specie because of the decreased predation in cave a male brandt bat wa recaptured in the wild after year making it the oldest known bat interaction with human conservation group such a the bat conservation international aim to increase awareness of bat ecological role and the environmental threat they face in the united kingdom all bat are protected under the wildlife and countryside act and disturbing a bat or it roost can be punished with a heavy fine in sarawak malaysia all bat are protected under the wildlife protection ordinance but specie such a the hairless bat cheiromeles torquatus are still eaten by the local community human have caused the extinction of several specie of bat in modern history the most recent being the christmas island pipistrelle pipistrellus murrayi which wa declared extinct in people put up bat house to attract bat the university of florida bat house is the largest occupied artificial roost in the world with around resident in britain thickwalled and partly underground world war ii pillbox have been converted to make roost for bat and bat house are occasionally built to mitigate damage to habitat from road or other development cave gate are sometimes installed to limit human entry into cave with sensitive or endangered bat specie the gate are designed not to limit the airflow and thus to maintain the cave of the specie of bat found in the united state are known to use human structure including building and bridge fourteen specie use bat housesbats are eaten in country across africa asia and the pacific rim in some case such a in guam flying fox have become endangered through being hunted for food there is evidence that wind turbine create sufficient barotrauma pressure damage to kill bat bat have typical mammalian lung which are thought to be more sensitive to sudden air pressure change than the lung of bird making them more liable to fatal rupture bat may be attracted to turbine perhaps seeking roost increasing the death rate acoustic deterrent may help to reduce bat mortality at wind farm cultural significance since bat are mammal yet can fly they are considered to be liminal being in various tradition in many culture including in europe bat are associated with darkness death witchcraft and malevolence among native american such a the creek cherokee and apache the bat is identified a a trickster in tanzania a winged batlike creature known a popobawa is believed to be a shapeshifting evil spirit that assault and sodomises it victim in aztec mythology bat symbolised the land of the dead destruction and decay an east nigerian tale tell that the bat developed it nocturnal habit after causing the death of his partner the and now hide by day to avoid arrestmore positive depiction of

death the bat is sacred in tonga and is often considered the physical manifestation of a separable soul in the zapotec civilisation of mesoamerica the bat god presided over corn and fertility the weird sister in shakespeare macbeth used the fur of a bat in their brew in western culture the bat is often a symbol of the night and it foreboding nature the bat is a primary animal associated with fictional character of the night both villainous vampire such a count dracula and before him varney the vampire and hero such a the dc comic character batman kenneth oppel silverwing novel narrate the adventure of a young bat based on the bat of north americathe bat is sometimes used a a heraldic symbol in spain and france appearing in the coat of arm of the town of valencia palma de mallorca fraga albacete and montchauvet three u state have an official state bat texas and oklahoma are represented by the mexican bat while virginia is represented by the virginia bat corynorhinus townsendii virginianus economics insectivorous bat in particular are especially helpful to farmer a they control population of agricultural pest and reduce the need to use pesticide it ha been estimated that bat save the agricultural industry of the united state anywhere from billion to billion per year in pesticide and damage to crop this also prevents the overuse of pesticide which can pollute the surrounding environment and may lead to resistance in future generation of insectsbat dung a type of guano is rich in nitrate and is mined from cave for use a fertiliser during the u civil war saltpetre wa collected from cave to make gunpowder it used to be thought that this wa bat guano but most of the nitrate come from nitrifying bacteriathe congress avenue bridge in austin texas is the
