the chicken gallus gallus domesticus is a type of domesticated fowl a subspecies of the red junglefowl gallus gallus chicken are one of the most common and widespread domestic animal with a total population of billion a of up from more than billion in there are more chicken in the world than any other bird or domesticated fowl human keep chicken primarily a a source of food consuming both their meat and egg and le commonly a pet originally raised for cockfighting or for special ceremony chicken were not kept for food until the hellenistic period century bc genetic study have pointed to multiple maternal origin in south asia southeast asia and east asia but with the clade found in the america europe the middle east and africa originating in the indian subcontinent from ancient india the domesticated chicken spread to lydia in western asia minor and to greece by the century bc fowl had been known in egypt since the century bc with the bird that give birth every day having come to egypt from the land between syria and shinar babylonia according to the annals of thutmose iii terminology in the uk and ireland adult male chicken over the age of one year are primarily known a cock whereas in the united state canada australia and new zealand they are more commonly called rooster male le than a year old are cockerel castrated or neutered rooster are called capon surgical and chemical castration are now illegal in some part of the world female over a year old are known a hen and younger female a pullet although in the industry a pullet becomes a hen when she begin to lay egg at to week of age in australia and new zealand also sometimes in britain there is a generic term chook to describe all age and both sex the young are often called chick chicken originally referred to young domestic fowl the specie a a whole wa then called domestic fowl or just fowl this use of chicken survives in the phrase hen and chicken sometimes used a a british public house or theatre name and to name group of one large and many small rock or island in the sea see for example hen and chicken island in the deep south of the united state chicken are referred to by the slang term yardbird general biology and habitat chicken are omnivore in the wild they often scratch at the soil to search for seed insect and even animal a large a lizard small snake or young micethe average chicken may live for five to ten year depending on the breed the world oldest known chicken wa a hen which died of heart failure at the age of year according to the guinness world recordsroosters can usually be differentiated from hen by their striking plumage of long flowing tail and shiny pointed feather on their neck hackle and back saddle which are typically of brighter bolder colour than those of female of the same breed however in some breed such a the sebright chicken the rooster ha only slightly pointed neck feather the same colour a the hen the identification can be made by looking at the comb or eventually from the development of spur on the male leg in a few breed and in certain hybrid the male and female chick may be differentiated by colour adult chicken have a fleshy crest on their head called a comb or cockscomb and hanging flap of skin either side under their beak called wattle collectively these and other fleshy protuberance on the head and throat are called caruncle both the adult male and female have wattle and comb but in most breed these are more prominent in male a muff or beard is a mutation found in several chicken breed which cause extra feathering under the chicken face giving the appearance of a beard domestic chicken are not capable of long distance flight although lighter chicken are generally capable of flying for short distance such a over fence or into tree where they would naturally roost chicken may occasionally fly briefly to explore their surroundings but generally do so only to flee perceived danger behavior social behaviour chicken are gregarious bird and live together in flock they have a communal approach to the incubation of egg and raising of young individual chicken in a flock will dominate others establishing a pecking order with dominant individual having priority for food access and nesting location removing hen or rooster from a flock cause a temporary disruption to this social order until a new pecking order is established adding hen especially younger bird to an existing flock can lead to fighting and injury when a rooster find food he may call other chicken to eat first he doe this by clucking in a high pitch a well a picking up and dropping the food this behaviour may also be observed in mother hen to call their chick and encourage them to eat a rooster crowing is a loud and sometimes shrill call and sends a territorial signal to other rooster however rooster may also crow in response to sudden disturbance within their surroundings hen cluck loudly after laying an egg and also to call their chick chicken also give different warning call when they sense a predator approaching from the air or on the ground courtship to initiate courting some rooster may dance in a circle around or near a hen a circle dance often lowering the wing which is closest to the hen the dance trigger a response in the hen and when she responds to his call the rooster may mount the hen and proceed with the mating more specifically mating typically involves the following sequence male approaching the hen male waltzing male waltzing female crouching receptive posture or stepping aside or running away if unwilling to copulate male mounting male treading with both foot on hen back male tail bending following successful copulation nesting and laying behaviour hen will often try to lay in nest that already contain egg and have been known to move egg from neighbouring nest into their own the result of this behaviour is that a flock will use only a few preferred location rather than having a different nest for every bird hen will often express a preference to lay in the same location it is not unknown for two or more hen to try to share the same nest at the same time if the nest is small or one of the hen is particularly determined this may result in chicken trying to lay on top of each other there is evidence that individual hen prefer to be either solitary or gregarious nester broodiness under natural condition most bird lay only until a clutch is complete and they will then incubate all the egg hen are then said to go broody the broody hen will stop laying and instead will focus on the incubation of the egg a full clutch is usually about egg she will sit or set on the nest protesting or pecking in defense if disturbed or removed and she will rarely leave the nest to eat drink or while brooding the hen maintains the nest at a constant temperature and humidity a well a turning the egg regularly during the first part of the incubation to stimulate broodiness owner may place several artificial egg in the nest to discourage it they may place the hen in an elevated cage with an open wire floor breed artificially developed for egg production rarely go broody and those that do often stop through the incubation however other breed such a the cochin cornish and silkie do regularly go broody and they make excellent mother not only for chicken egg but also for those of other specie even those with much smaller or larger egg and different incubation period such a quail pheasant turkey or goose hatching and early life fertile chicken egg hatch at the end of the incubation period about day development of the chick start only when incubation begin so all chick hatch within a day or two of each other despite perhaps being laid over a period of two week or so before hatching the hen can hear the chick peeping inside the egg and will gently cluck to stimulate them to break out of their shell the chick begin by pipping pecking a breathing hole with it egg tooth towards the blunt end of the egg usually on the upper side the chick then rest for some hour absorbing the remaining egg yolk and withdrawing the blood supply from the membrane beneath the shell used earlier for breathing through the shell the chick then enlarges the hole gradually turning round a it go and eventually severing the blunt end of the shell completely to make a lid the chick crawl out of the remaining shell and the wet down dry out in the warmth of the nest hen usually remain on the nest for about two day after the first chick hatch and during this time the newly hatched chick feed by absorbing the internal yolk sac some breed sometimes start eating cracked egg which can become habitual hen fiercely guard their chick and brood them when necessary to keep them warm at first often returning to the nest at night she lead them to food and water and will call them toward edible item but seldom feed them directly she continues to care for them until they are several week old although there are some hen the black hen atriana in the territory of atri that are aggressive and often kill their own chick they are characterized a a hen that lay mant egg daily defensive behaviour chicken may occasionally gang up on a weak or inexperienced predator at least one credible report exists of a young fox killed by hen a group of hen have been recorded in attacking a hawk that had entered their coop embryology chicken embryo have long been used a model system to study developing embryo easy access to the embryo is provided by commercial chicken farmer who sell fertilized egg which can be easily opened and which allow scientist to observe the developing embryo equally important embryologist can carry out experiment on such embryo close the egg again and study the effect later on for instance many important discovery in the area of limb development have been made using chicken embryo such a the discovery of the apical ectodermal ridge aer and the zone of polarizing activity zpa by john w saundersin scientist researching the ancestry of bird turned on a chicken recessive gene and found that the embryo jaw initiated formation of teeth like those found in ancient bird fossil john fallon the overseer of the project stated that chicken have retained the ability to make teeth under certain condition genetics and genomics given it eminent role in farming meat production but also research the house chicken wa the first bird genome to be sequenced at gb the chicken genome is considerably smaller than other vertebrate genome such a the human genome gb the final gene set contained gene including noncoding gene and pseudogenes with a total of gene in annotation release a similar number of gene a in the human genome breeding origin galliformes the order of bird that chicken belong to is directly linked to the survival of bird when all other dinosaur went extinct water or fowl similar to modern partridge survived the extinction event that killed all bird and dinosaur some of these evolved into the modern galliformes of which domesticated chicken are a main model they are descended primarily from the red junglefowl gallus gallus and are scientifically classified a the same specie a such they can and do freely interbreed with population of red junglefowl subsequent hybridization of domestic chicken with grey junglefowl sri lankan junglefowl and green junglefowl occurred with at least a gene for yellow skin wa incorporated into domestic bird through hybridization with the grey junglefowl g sonneratii in a study published in it wa found that chicken shared between of their genome with red junglefowl with domestication period dated to year ago the traditional view is that chicken were first domesticated for cockfighting in asia africa and europe in the last decade there have been a number of genetic study to clarify the origin according to one early study a single domestication event which took place in what now is the country of thailand gave rise to the modern chicken with minor transition separating the modern breed however that study wa later found to be based on incomplete data and recent study point to multiple maternal origin with the clade found in the america europe middle east and africa originating from the indian subcontinent where a large number of unique haplotype occur the red junglefowl known a the bamboo fowl in many southeast asian language is a special bird to take advantage of the large amount of fruit that are produced during the end of the bamboo seeding cycle to boost it own reproduction in domesticating the chicken human took advantage of this predisposition for prolific reproduction of the red junglefowl when exposed to large amount of foodseveral controversy still surround the time chicken wa domesticated a recent molecular evidence obtained from study published in reveal that chicken wa domesticated year ago though it wa previously thought to have been domesticated in southern china in bc based on paleoclimatic assumption which ha now raised doubt from another study that question whether those bird were the ancestor of chicken today majority of the world chicken today may have migrated from the harappan culture of the indus valley eventually the chicken moved to the tarim basin of central asia the chicken reached europe romania turkey greece ukraine about bc introduction into western europe came far later about the millennium bc phoenician spread chicken along the mediterranean coast a far a iberia breeding increased under the roman empire and wa reduced in the middle age genetic sequencing of chicken bone from archaeological site in europe revealed that in the high middle age chicken became le aggressive and began to lay egg earlier in the breeding seasonmiddle east trace of chicken go back to a little earlier than bc in syria chicken went southward only in the millennium bc they reached egypt for purpose of cockfighting about bc and became widely bred only in ptolemaic egypt about bc little is known about the chicken introduction into africa it wa during the hellenistic period century bc in the southern levant that chicken began widely to be domesticated for food this change occurred at least year before domestication of chicken spread to europe three possible route of introduction in about the early first millennium ad could have been through the egyptian nile valley the east africa or indian trade or from carthage and the berber across the sahara the earliest known remains are from mali nubia east coast and south africa and date back to the middle of the first millennium addomestic chicken in the america before western contact is still an ongoing discussion but chicken found only in the america and asia suggest an asian origin for early american chickensa lack of data from thailand russia the indian subcontinent southeast asia and africa make it difficult to lay out a clear map of the spread of chicken in these area better description and genetic analysis of local breed threatened by extinction may also help with research into this area south america an unusual variety of chicken that ha it origin in south america is the araucana bred in southern chile by the mapuche people araucanas some of which are tailless and some of which have tuft of feather around their ear lay egg it ha long been suggested that they the arrival of european chicken brought by the spanish and are evidence of contact between asian or pacific oceanic people particularly the polynesian and south america in an international team of researcher reported the result of analysis of chicken bone found on the arauco peninsula in chile radiocarbon dating suggested that the chicken were and dna analysis showed that they were related to prehistoric population of chicken in polynesia these result appeared to confirm that the chicken came from polynesia and that there were transpacific contact between polynesia and south america before columbus arrival in the americashowever a later report looking at the same specimen concluded a published apparently chilean specimen and six polynesian specimen also cluster with the same asian sequence providing no support for a polynesian introduction of chicken to south america in contrast sequence from two archaeological site on easter island group with an uncommon haplogroup from indonesia japan and china and may represent a genetic signature of an early polynesian dispersal modeling of the potential marine carbon contribution to the chilean archaeological specimen cast further doubt on claim for chicken and definitive proof will require further analysis of ancient dna sequence and radiocarbon and stable isotope data from archaeological excavation within both chile and polynesia the debate for and against a polynesian origin for south american chicken continued with this paper and subsequent response in pnas use by human farming more than billion chicken are reared annually a a source of meat and egg in the united state alone more than billion chicken are slaughtered each year for meat and more than million chicken are reared for egg productionthe vast majority of poultry are raised in factory farm according to the worldwatch institute percent of the world poultry meat and percent of egg are produced this way an alternative to intensive poultry farming is farming friction between these two main method ha led to issue of ethical consumerism opponent of intensive farming argue that it harm the environment creates human health risk and is inhumane advocate of intensive farming say that their highly efficient system save land and food resource owing to increased productivity and that the animal are looked after in environmentally controlled facility reared for meat chicken farmed for meat are called broiler chicken will naturally live for six or more year but broiler breed typically take le than six week to reach slaughter size a free range or organic broiler will usually be slaughtered at about week of age reared for egg chicken farmed primarily for egg are called layer hen in total the uk alone consumes more than million egg per day some hen breed can produce over egg per year with the highest authenticated rate of egg laying being egg in day after month of laying the commercial hen ability start to decline to the point where the flock is commercially unviable hen particularly from battery cage system are sometimes infirm or have lost a significant amount of their feather and their life expectancy ha been reduced from around seven year to le than two year in the uk and europe laying hen are then slaughtered and used in processed food or sold a soup hen in some other country flock are sometimes force moulted rather than being slaughtered to this involves complete withdrawal of food and sometimes water for day or sufficiently long to cause a body weight loss of to or up to day under experimental condition this stimulates the hen to lose her feather but also some flock may be several time in more than of all flock were moulted in the u a pet keeping chicken a pet became increasingly popular in the among urban and suburban resident many people obtain chicken for their egg production but often name them and treat them a any other pet chicken are just like any other pet in that they provide companionship and have individual personality while many do not cuddle much they will eat from one hand respond to and follow their handler a well a show affectionchickens are social inquisitive intelligent bird and many find their behaviour entertaining certain breed such a silkies and many bantam variety are generally docile and are often recommended a good pet around child with disability many people feed chicken in part with kitchen food scrap chicken can carry and transmit salmonella in their dander and feces in the united state the center for disease control and prevention advise against bringing them indoors or letting small child handle them artificial incubation incubation can successfully occur artificially in machine that provide the correct controlled environment for the developing chick the average incubation period for chicken is day but may depend on the temperature and humidity in the incubator temperature regulation is the most critical factor for a successful hatch variation of more than from the optimum temperature of will reduce hatch rate humidity is also important because the rate at which egg lose water by evaporation depends on the ambient relative humidity evaporation can be assessed by candling to view the size of the air sac or by measuring weight loss relative humidity should be increased to around in the last three day of incubation to keep the membrane around the hatching chick from drying out after the chick crack the shell lower humidity is usual in the first day to ensure adequate evaporation the position of the egg in the incubator can also influence hatch rate for best result egg should be placed with the pointed end down and turned regularly at least three time per day until one to three day before hatching if the egg are turned the embryo inside may stick to the shell and may hatch with physical defect adequate ventilation is necessary to provide the embryo with oxygen older egg require increased ventilation many commercial incubator are with shelf holding ten of thousand of egg at a time with rotation of the egg a fully automated process home incubator are box holding from to egg they are usually electrically powered but in the past some were heated with an oil or paraffin lamp disease and ailment chicken are susceptible to several parasite including louse mite tick flea and intestinal worm a well a other disease despite the name they are not affected by chickenpox which is generally restricted to humanssome of the disease that can affect chicken are shown below in religion and mythology since antiquity chicken have been and still are a sacred animal in some culture and deeply embedded within belief system and religious worship the term persian bird for the rooster appears to have been given by the greek after persian contact because of his great importance and his religious use among the persian in indonesia the chicken ha great significance during the hindu cremation ceremony a chicken is considered a channel for evil spirit which may be present during the ceremony a chicken is tethered by the leg and kept present at the ceremony for it duration to ensure that any evil spirit present go into the chicken and not the family member the chicken is then taken home and return to it normal life in ancient greece chicken were not normally used for sacrifice perhaps because they were still considered an exotic animal because of it valor the cock is found a an attribute of are heracles and athena the alleged last word of socrates a he died from hemlock poisoning a recounted by plato were crito i owe a cock to asclepius will you remember to pay the debt signifying that death wa a cure for the illness of life the greek believed that even lion were afraid of rooster several of aesop fable reference this belief in the new testament jesus prophesied the betrayal by peter jesus answered i tell you peter before the rooster crow today you will deny three time that you know me it happened and peter cried bitterly this made the rooster a symbol for both vigilance and betrayal earlier jesus compare himself to a mother hen when talking about jerusalem o jerusalem jerusalem you who kill the prophet and stone those sent to you how often i have longed to gather your child together a a hen gather her chick under her wing but you were not willing in the sixth century pope gregory i declared the rooster the emblem of christianity and another papal enactment of the ninth century by pope nicholas i ordered the figure of the rooster to be placed on every church steeplein many central european folk tale the devil is believed to flee at the first crowing of a rooster in traditional jewish practice a kosher animal is swung around the head and then slaughtered on the afternoon before yom kippur the day of atonement in a ritual called kapparos it is now common practice to cradle the bird and move him or her around the head a chicken or fish is typically used because it is commonly available and small enough to hold the sacrifice of the animal is to receive atonement for the animal symbolically take on all the person sin in kapparos the meat is then donated to the poor a woman brings a hen for the ceremony while a man brings a rooster although not a sacrifice in the biblical sense the death of the animal reminds the penitent sinner that his or her life is in god hand the talmud speaks of learning courtesy toward one mate from the rooster this might refer to the fact that when a rooster find something good to eat he call his hen to eat first a rooster might also come to the aid of a hen if she is attacked the talmud likewise provides u with the statement had the torah not been given to u we would have learned modesty from cat honest toil from ant chastity from dove and gallantry from cock which may be further understood a to that of the gallantry of cock being taken in the context of a religious instilling vessel of a girt one of the loin young literal translation that which is stately in his stride and move with stately bearing in the book of proverb a referenced by michael v fox in his proverb where sa`adiah ben yosef gaon saadia gaon identifies the definitive trait of a cock girded about the loin in proverb bible a the honesty of their behavior and their success identifying a spiritual purpose of a religious vessel within that religious instilling schema of purpose and use the chicken is one of the symbol of the chinese zodiac in chinese folk religion a cooked chicken a a religious offering is usually limited to ancestor veneration and worship of village deity vegetarian deity such a the buddha are not recipient of such offering under some observation an offering of chicken is presented with serious prayer while roasted pork is offered during a joyous celebration in confucian chinese wedding a chicken can be used a a substitute for one who is seriously ill or not available eg sudden death to attend the ceremony a red silk scarf is placed on the chicken head and a close relative of the absent hold the chicken so the ceremony may proceed however this practice is rare today a cockatrice wa supposed to have been born from an egg laid by a rooster a well a killed by a rooster call in history an early domestication of chicken in southeast asia is probable since the word for domestic chicken manuk is part of the reconstructed language see austronesian language chicken together with dog and pig were the domestic animal of the lapita culture the first neolithic culture of oceaniathe first picture of chicken in europe are found on corinthian pottery of the century bc the poet cratinus century bc according to the later greek author athenaeus call the chicken the persian alarm in aristophanes comedy the bird bc a chicken is called the median bird which point to an introduction from the east picture of chicken are found on greek red figure and pottery in ancient greece chicken were still rare and were a rather prestigious food for symposium delos seems to have been a center of chicken breeding columella de re rustica about bc chicken were common in sindh after the attack of aria people these fowl spred from sindh to balakh and iran during attack and war between iranian and greek the chicken of hellanic breed came in iran and about bc hellanic chicken came into sindh through medan the roman used chicken for oracle both when flying ex avibus augury and when feeding auspicium ex tripudiis alectryomancy the hen gallina gave a favourable omen auspicium ratum when appearing from the left cic de div like the crow and the owl for the oracle ex tripudiis according to cicero cic de div any bird could be used in auspice and show at one point that any bird could perform the tripudium but normally only chicken pulli were consulted the chicken were cared for by the pullarius who opened their cage and fed them pulse or a special kind of soft cake when an augury wa needed if the chicken stayed in their cage made noise occinerent beat their wing or flew away the omen wa bad if they ate greedily the omen wa goodin bc the roman general publius claudius pulcher had his sacred chicken thrown overboard when they refused to feed before the battle of drepana saying if they wo eat perhaps they will drink he promptly lost the battle against the carthaginian and roman ship were sunk back in rome he wa tried for impiety and heavily finedin bc the lex faunia forbade fattening hen on grain which wa a measure enacted to reduce the demand for grain to get around this the roman castrated rooster capon which resulted in a doubling of size despite the law that wa passed in rome that forbade the consumption of fattened chicken it wa renewed a number of time but doe not seem to have been successful fattening chicken with bread soaked in milk wa thought to give especially delicious result the roman gourmet apicius offer recipe for chicken mainly boiled chicken with a sauce all part of the animal are used the recipe include the stomach liver testicle and even the pygostyle the fatty tail of the chicken where the tail feather attach the roman author columella give advice on chicken breeding in the eighth book of his treatise de re rustica on agriculture he identified tanagrian rhodic chalkidic and median commonly misidentified a melian breed which have an impressive appearance a quarrelsome nature and were used for cockfighting by the greek de re rustica for farming native roman chicken are to be preferred or a cross between native hen and greek cock de re rustica dwarf chicken are nice to watch because of their size but have no other advantage according to columella de re rustica the ideal flock consists of bird which can be supervised by one person if someone is watching for stray animal white chicken should be avoided a they are not very fertile and are easily caught by eagle or goshawk one cock should be kept for five hen in the case of rhodian and median cock that are very heavy and therefore not much inclined to sex only three hen are kept per cock the hen of heavy fowl are not much inclined to brood therefore their egg are best hatched by normal hen a hen can hatch no more than egg depending on the time of year and supervise no more than hatchling egg that are long and pointed give more male hatchling rounded egg mainly female hatchling de re rustica columella also state that chicken coop should face southeast and lie adjacent to the kitchen a smoke is beneficial for the animal and poultry never thrive so well a in warmth and smoke de re rustica coop should consist of three room and posse a hearth dry dust or ash should be provided for according to columella de re rustica chicken should be fed on barley groat small millet and wheat bran if they are cheap wheat itself should be avoided a it is harmful to the bird boiled ryegrass lolium sp and the leaf and seed of alfalfa medicago sativa l can be used a well grape marc can be used but only when the hen stop laying egg that is about the middle of november otherwise egg are small and few when feeding grape marc it should be supplemented with some bran hen start to lay egg after the winter solstice in warm place around the first of january in colder area in the middle of february parboiled barley increase their fertility this should be mixed with alfalfa leaf and seed or vetch or millet if alfalfa is not at hand chicken should receive two cup of barley daily columella advises farmer to slaughter hen that are older than three year those that are productive or are poor of their egg and particularly those that eat their own and other hen egg according to aldrovandi capon were produced by burning the hind part of the bowel or loin or spur with a hot iron the wound wa treated with potter chalk for the use of poultry and egg in the kitchen of ancient rome see roman eating and drinking chicken were spread by polynesian seafarer and reached easter island in the century ad where they were the only domestic animal with the possible exception of the polynesian rat rattus exulans they were housed in extremely solid chicken coop built from stone which wa first reported a such to linton palmer in who also expressed his doubt about this see also reference further reading stephen
