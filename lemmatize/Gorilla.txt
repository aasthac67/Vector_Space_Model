gorilla are predominantly herbivorous ape that inhabit the forest of central africa the genus gorilla is divided into two specie the eastern gorilla and the western gorilla both critically endangered and either four or five subspecies they are the largest living primate the dna of gorilla is highly similar to that of human from to depending on what is included and they are the next closest living relative to human after the chimpanzee and bonobo gorilla natural habitat cover tropical or subtropical forest in africa although their range cover a small percentage of africa gorilla cover a wide range of elevation the mountain gorilla inhabits the albertine rift montane cloud forest of the virunga volcano ranging in altitude from to metre to ft lowland gorilla live in dense forest and lowland swamp and marsh a low a sea level with western lowland gorilla living in central west african country and eastern lowland gorilla living in the democratic republic of the congo near it border with rwanda etymology the word gorilla come from the history of hanno the navigator c bc a carthaginian explorer on an expedition on the west african coast to the area that later became sierra leone member of the expedition encountered savage people the greater part of whom were woman whose body were hairy and whom our interpreter called gorillae it is unknown whether what the explorer encountered were what we now call gorilla another specie of ape or monkey or human skin of gorillai woman brought back by hanno are reputed to have been kept at carthage until rome destroyed the city year later at the end of the punic war bc the american physician and missionary thomas staughton savage and naturalist jeffries wyman first described the western gorilla they called it troglodyte gorilla in from specimen obtained in liberia the name wa derived from ancient greek gorillai gorillai meaning of hairy woman described by hanno evolution and classification the closest relative of gorilla are the other two homininae genus chimpanzee and human all of them having diverged from a common ancestor about million year ago human gene sequence differ only on average from the sequence of corresponding gorilla gene but there is further difference in how many copy each gene ha until recently gorilla were considered to be a single specie with three subspecies the western lowland gorilla the eastern lowland gorilla and the mountain gorilla there is now agreement that there are two specie each with two subspecies more recently a third subspecies ha been claimed to exist in one of the specie the separate specie and subspecies developed from a single type of gorilla during the ice age when their forest habitat shrank and became isolated from each otherprimatologists continue to explore the relationship between various gorilla population the specie and subspecies listed here are the one upon which most scientist agree the proposed third subspecies of gorilla beringei which ha not yet received a trinomen is the bwindi population of the mountain gorilla sometimes called the bwindi gorilla some variation that distinguish the classification of gorilla include varying density size hair colour length culture and facial width population genetics of the lowland gorilla suggest that the western and eastern lowland population diverged thousand year ago physical characteristic gorilla move around by although they sometimes walk bipedally for short distance while carrying food or in defensive situation and some mountain gorilla use other part of their hand to aid locomotion study of mountain gorilla published in showed only used knuckle walking but the remainder used knuckle walking plus other part of their walking in way that do not use the knuckle using the back of their hand and using their palm there is individual variation in the frequency and ease with which gorilla walk upright certain gorilla at philadelphia zoo and london zoo have been observed walking upright more frequently and for longer distance than normal with one gorilla at the philadelphia zoo named louis often doing so to avoid getting mud on his hand wild male gorilla weigh to kg to lb while adult female weigh kg lb adult male are to m ft in to ft in tall with an arm span that stretch from to m ft in to ft in female gorilla are shorter at to m ft in to ft in with smaller arm span grove calculated the average weight of wild adult male gorilla at kg while smith and jungers found the average weight of wild adult male gorilla to be kg adult male gorilla are known a silverback due to the characteristic silver hair on their back reaching to the hip the tallest gorilla recorded wa a m ft in silverback with an arm span of m ft in a chest of m ft in and a weight of kg lb shot in alimbongo northern kivu in may the heaviest gorilla recorded wa a m ft in silverback shot in ambam cameroon which weighed kg lb male in captivity can be overweight and reach weight up to kg lb gorilla facial structure is described a mandibular prognathism that is the mandible protrudes farther out than the maxilla adult male also have a prominent sagittal crest the eastern gorilla is more darkly coloured than the western gorilla with the mountain gorilla being the darkest of all the mountain gorilla also ha the thickest hair the western lowland gorilla can be brown or grayish with a reddish forehead in addition gorilla that live in lowland forest are more slender and agile than the more bulky mountain gorilla the eastern gorilla also ha a longer face and broader chest than the western gorillastudies have shown gorilla blood is not reactive to and monoclonal antibody which would in human indicate type o blood due to novel sequence though it is different enough to not conform with the human abo blood group system into which the other great ape fit like human gorilla have individual fingerprint their eye colour is dark brown framed by a black ring around the iris a gorilla lifespan is normally between and year although zoo gorilla may live for year or more colo a female western gorilla at the columbus zoo and aquarium wa the oldest known gorilla at year of age when she died on january distribution and habitat gorilla have a patchy distribution the range of the two specie is separated by the congo river and it tributary the western gorilla life in west central africa while the eastern gorilla life in east central africa between the specie and even within the specie gorilla live in a variety of habitat and elevation gorilla habitat range from montane forest to swampland eastern gorilla inhabit montane and submontane forest between and m and ft above sea level mountain gorilla live in montane forest at the higher end of the elevation range while eastern lowland gorilla live in submontane forest at the lower end in addition eastern lowland gorilla live in montane bamboo forest a well a lowland forest ranging from m ft in elevation western gorilla live in both lowland swamp forest and montane forest at elevation ranging from sea level to m ft western lowland gorilla live in swamp and lowland forest ranging up to m ft and cross river gorilla live in and submontane forest ranging from m ft nesting gorilla construct nest for daytime and night use nest tend to be simple aggregation of branch and leaf about to ft to m in diameter and are constructed by individual gorilla unlike chimpanzee or orangutan tend to sleep in nest on the ground the young nest with their mother but construct nest after three year of age initially close to those of their mother gorilla nest are distributed arbitrarily and use of tree specie for site and construction appears to be opportunistic by great ape is now considered to be not just animal architecture but a an important instance of tool use food and foraging a gorilla day is divided between rest period and travel or feeding period diet differ between and within specie mountain gorilla mostly eat foliage such a leaf stem pith and shoot while fruit make up a very small part of their diet mountain gorilla food is widely distributed and neither individual nor group have to compete with one another their home range vary from to to and their movement range around m mi or le on an average day despite eating a few specie in each habitat mountain gorilla have flexible diet and can live in a variety of habitat eastern lowland gorilla have more diverse diet which vary seasonally leaf and pith are commonly eaten but fruit can make up a much a of their diet since fruit is le available lowland gorilla must travel farther each day and their home range vary from to with day range m mi eastern lowland gorilla will also eat insect preferably ant western lowland gorilla depend on fruit more than the others and they are more dispersed across their range they travel even farther than the other gorilla subspecies at m mi per day on average and have larger home range of western lowland gorilla have le access to terrestrial herb although they can access aquatic herb in some area termite and ant are also eaten gorilla rarely drink water because they consume succulent vegetation that is comprised of almost half water a well a morning dew although both mountain and lowland gorilla have been observed drinking behaviour social structure gorilla live in group called troop troop tend to be made of one adult male or silverback multiple adult female and their offspring however troop also exist a silverback is typically more than year of age and is named for the distinctive patch of silver hair on his back which come with maturity silverback also have large canine teeth that also come with maturity both male and female tend to emigrate from their natal group for mountain gorilla female disperse from their natal troop more than male mountain gorilla and western lowland gorilla also commonly transfer to second new groupsmature male also tend to leave their group and establish their own troop by attracting emigrating female however male mountain gorilla sometimes stay in their natal troop and become subordinate to the silverback if the silverback dy these male may be able to become dominant or mate with the female this behaviour ha not been observed in eastern lowland gorilla in a single male group when the silverback dy the female and their offspring disperse and find a new troop without a silverback to protect them the infant will likely fall victim to infanticide joining a new group is likely to be a tactic against this however while gorilla troop usually disband after the silverback dy female eastern lowland gorilla and their offspring have been recorded staying together until a new silverback transfer into the group this likely serf a protection from leopard the silverback is the center of the troop attention making all the decision mediating conflict determining the movement of the group leading the others to feeding site and taking responsibility for the safety and of the troop younger male subordinate to the silverback known a blackbacks may serve a backup protection blackbacks are aged between and year and lack the silver back hair the bond that a silverback ha with his female form the core of gorilla social life bond between them are maintained by grooming and staying close together female form strong relationship with male to gain mating opportunity and protection from predator and infanticidal outside male however aggressive behaviour between male and female do occur but rarely lead to serious injury relationship between female may vary maternally related female in a troop tend to be friendly towards each other and associate closely otherwise female have few friendly encounter and commonly act aggressively towards each otherfemales may fight for social access to male and a male may intervene male gorilla have weak social bond particularly in group with apparent dominance hierarchy and strong competition for mate male in group though tend to have friendly interaction and socialise through play grooming and staying together and occasionally they even engage in homosexual interaction severe aggression is rare in stable group but when two mountain gorilla group meet the two silverback can sometimes engage in a fight to the death using their canine to cause deep gaping injury competition one possible predator of gorilla is the leopard gorilla remains have been found in leopard scat but this may be the result of scavenging when the group is attacked by human leopard or other gorilla an individual silverback will protect the group even at the cost of his own life reproduction and parenting female mature at year earlier in captivity and male at year a female first ovulatory cycle occurs when she is six year of age and is followed by a period of adolescent infertility the estrous cycle last day with outward ovulation sign subtle compared to those of chimpanzee the gestation period last month female mountain gorilla first give birth at year of age and have interbirth interval male can be fertile before reaching adulthood gorilla mate year roundfemales will purse their lip and slowly approach a male while making eye contact this serf to urge the male to mount her if the male doe not respond then she will try to attract his attention by reaching towards him or slapping the ground in group solicitation indicates female preference but female can be forced to mate with multiple male male incite copulation by approaching a female and displaying at her or touching her and giving a train grunt recently gorilla have been observed engaging in sex a trait once considered unique to human and bonobo gorilla infant are vulnerable and dependent thus mother their primary caregiver are important to their survival male gorilla are not active in caring for the young but they do play a role in socialising them to other youngster the silverback ha a largely supportive relationship with the infant in his troop and shield them from aggression within the group infant remain in contact with their mother for the first five month and mother stay near the silverback for protection infant suckle at least once per hour and sleep with their mother in the same nestinfants begin to break contact with their mother after five month but only for a brief period each time by month old infant move up to five meter foot from their mother at around month the distance between mother and offspring increase and they regularly spend time away from each other in addition nursing decrease to once every two hour infant spend only half of their time with their mother by month they enter their juvenile period at their third year and this last until their sixth year at this time gorilla are weaned and they sleep in a separate nest from their mother after their offspring are weaned female begin to ovulate and soon become pregnant again the presence of play partner including the silverback minimizes conflict in weaning between mother and offspring communication distinct vocalisation are recognised many of which are used primarily for group communication within dense vegetation sound classified a grunt and bark are heard most frequently while traveling and indicate the whereabouts of individual group member they may also be used during social interaction when discipline is required scream and roar signal alarm or warning and are produced most often by silverback deep rumbling belch suggest contentment and are heard frequently during feeding and resting period they are the most common form of intragroup communicationfor this reason conflict are most often resolved by display and other threat behaviour that are intended to intimidate without becoming physical the ritualized charge display is unique to gorilla the entire sequence ha nine step progressively quickening hooting symbolic feeding rising bipedally throwing vegetation with cupped hand one leg kick sideways running to slapping and tearing vegetation and thumping the ground with palm to end display intelligence gorilla are considered highly intelligent a few individual in captivity such a koko have been taught a subset of sign language like the other great ape gorilla can laugh grieve have rich emotional life develop strong family bond make and use tool and think about the past and future some researcher believe gorilla have spiritual feeling or religious sentiment they have been shown to have culture in different area revolving around different method of food preparation and will show individual colour preference tool use the following observation were made by a team led by thomas breuer of the wildlife conservation society in september gorilla are now known to use tool in the wild a female gorilla in the national park in the republic of congo wa recorded using a stick a if to gauge the depth of water whilst crossing a swamp a second female wa seen using a tree stump a a bridge and also a a support whilst fishing in the swamp this mean all of the great ape are now known to use toolsin september a gorilla in the republic of congo wa discovered using rock to smash open palm nut inside a game sanctuary while this wa the first such observation for a gorilla over year previously chimpanzee had been seen using tool in the wild for termite great ape are endowed with semiprecision grip and have been able to use both simple tool and even weapon such a improvising a club from a convenient fallen branch scientific study american physician and missionary thomas staughton savage obtained the first specimen the skull and other bone during his time in liberia the first scientific description of gorilla date back to an article by savage and the naturalist jeffries wyman in in proceeding of the boston society of natural history where troglodyte gorilla is described now known a the western gorilla other specie of gorilla were described in the next few year the explorer paul du chaillu wa the first westerner to see a live gorilla during his travel through western equatorial africa from to he brought dead specimen to the uk in first systematic study wa not conducted until the when carl akeley of the american museum of natural history traveled to africa to hunt for an animal to be shot and stuffed on his first trip he wa accompanied by his friend mary bradley a mystery writer her husband and their young daughter alice who would later write science fiction under the pseudonym james tiptree jr after their trip mary bradley wrote on the gorilla trail she later became an advocate for the conservation of gorilla and wrote several more book mainly for child in the late and early robert yerkes and his wife ava helped further the study of gorilla when they sent harold bigham to africa yerkes also wrote a book in about the great ape after world war ii george schaller wa one of the first researcher to go into the field and study primate in he conducted a systematic study of the mountain gorilla in the wild and published his work year later at the behest of louis leakey and the national geographic dian fossey conducted a much longer and more comprehensive study of the mountain gorilla when she published her work many misconception and myth about gorilla were finally disproved including the myth that gorilla are violent western lowland gorilla g g gorilla are believed to be one of the zoonotic origin of the sivgor simian immunodeficiency virus that infects them is similar to a certain strain of genome sequencing the gorilla became the great ape genus to have it genome sequenced the first gorilla genome wa generated with short read and sanger sequencing using dna from a female western lowland gorilla named kamilah this gave scientist further insight into the evolution and origin of human despite the chimpanzee being the closest extant relative of human of the human genome wa found to be more like that of the gorilla in addition of the gorilla genome is closer to human or chimpanzee than the latter are to each other this is rarer around coding gene indicating pervasive selection throughout great ape evolution and ha functional consequence in gene expression analysis of the gorilla genome ha cast doubt on the idea that the rapid evolution of hearing gene gave rise to language in human a it also occurred in gorilla cultural reference since coming to the attention of western society in the gorilla have been a recurring element of many aspect of popular culture and medium for example gorilla have featured prominently in monstrous fantasy film such a king kong additionally pulp fiction story such a tarzan and conan the barbarian have featured gorilla a physical opponent of the titular protagonist conservation status all specie and subspecies of gorilla are listed a endangered or critically endangered on the iucn red list now over western lowland gorilla are thought to exist in the wild with in zoo thanks to conservation eastern lowland gorilla have a population of under in the wild and in zoo mountain gorilla are the most severely endangered with an estimated population of about left in the wild and none in zoo threat to gorilla survival include habitat destruction and poaching for the bushmeat trade in a population of several hundred gorilla in the odzala national park republic of congo wa essentially wiped out by the ebola virus a study published in science concluded more than gorilla may have died in recent outbreak of the ebola virus in central africa the researcher indicated in conjunction with commercial hunting of these ape the virus creates a recipe for rapid ecological extinction conservation effort include the great ape survival project a partnership between the united nation environment programme and the unesco and also an international treaty the agreement on the conservation of gorilla and their habitat concluded under convention on migratory specie the gorilla
