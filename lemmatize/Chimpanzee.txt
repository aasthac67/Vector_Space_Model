the chimpanzee pan troglodyte also known a the common chimpanzee robust chimpanzee or simply chimp is a specie of great ape native to the forest and savannah of tropical africa it ha four confirmed subspecies and a fifth proposed subspecies the chimpanzee and the closely related bonobo sometimes called the pygmy chimpanzee are classified in the genus pan evidence from fossil and dna sequencing show that pan is a sister taxon to the human lineage and is human closest living relative the chimpanzee is covered in coarse black hair but ha a bare face finger toe palm of the hand and sol of the foot it is larger and more robust than the bonobo weighing kg lb for male and kg lb for female and standing to cm ft in to ft in it gestation period is eight month the infant is weaned at about three year old but usually maintains a close relationship with it mother for several year more the chimpanzee life in group that range in size from to member although individual travel and forage in much smaller group during the day the specie life in a strict hierarchy where dispute are generally settled without the need for violence nearly all chimpanzee population have been recorded using tool modifying stick rock grass and leaf and using them for hunting and acquiring honey termite ant nut and water the specie ha also been found creating sharpened stick to spear small mammal the chimpanzee is listed on the iucn red list a an endangered specie between and individual are estimated across it range the biggest threat to the chimpanzee are habitat loss poaching and disease chimpanzee appear in western popular culture a stereotyped and have featured in entertainment such a chimpanzee tea party circus act and stage show they are sometimes kept a pet though their strength and aggressiveness make them dangerous in this role some hundred have been kept in laboratory for research especially in america many attempt have been made to teach language such a american sign language to chimpanzee with limited success etymology the english word chimpanzee is first recorded in it is derived from vili or tshiluba language chimpenze with a meaning of ape the colloquialism chimp wa most likely coined some time in the late the genus name pan derives from the greek god while the specific name troglodyte wa taken from the troglodytae a mythical race of taxonomy and genetics the first great ape known to western science in the century wa the genus pongo the local malay name being recorded in java by the dutch physician jacobus bontius in the dutch anatomist nicolaes tulp applied the name to a chimpanzee or bonobo brought to the netherlands from angola another dutch anatomist peter camper dissected specimen from central africa and southeast asia in the noting the difference between the african and asian ape the german naturalist johann friedrich blumenbach classified the chimpanzee a simia troglodyte by another german naturalist lorenz oken coined the genus pan in the bonobo wa recognised a distinct from the chimpanzee by evolution despite a large number of homo fossil find pan fossil were not described until existing chimpanzee population in west and central africa do not overlap with the major human fossil site in east africa but chimpanzee fossil have now been reported from kenya this indicates that both human and member of the pan clade were present in the east african rift valley during the middle pleistocenedna evidence suggests the bonobo and chimpanzee specie separated from each other le than one million year ago similar in relation between homo sapiens and neanderthal a genetic study suggests ancient gene flow introgression between and thousand year ago from the bonobo into the ancestor of central and eastern chimpanzee the chimpanzee line split from the last common ancestor of the human line around six million year ago because no specie other than homo sapiens ha survived from the human line of that branching both chimpanzee specie are the closest living relative of human the lineage of human and chimpanzee diverged from gorilla genus gorilla about seven million year ago a study argues the chimpanzee should be included in the human branch a homo troglodyte and note expert say many scientist are likely to resist the reclassification especially in the and often disputed field of anthropology subspecies four subspecies of the chimpanzee have been recognised with the possibility of a fifth central chimpanzee or tschego pan troglodyte troglodyte in cameroon the central african republic equatorial guinea gabon the republic of the congo and the democratic republic of the congo western chimpanzee p troglodyte verus in guinea mali senegal sierra leone liberia ivory coast and ghana chimpanzee p troglodyte ellioti also known a p t vellerosus in nigeria and cameroon eastern chimpanzee p troglodyte schweinfurthii in the central african republic south sudan the democratic republic of the congo uganda rwanda burundi tanzania and zambia southeastern chimpanzee p troglodyte marungensis in burundi rwanda tanzania and uganda colin grove argues that this is a subspecies created by enough variation between the northern and southern population of p t schweinfurthii genome human and chimpanzee dna is very similar a chimpanzee genome project wa initiated after the completion of the human genome project in december a preliminary analysis of gene shared between the two genome confirmed that certain gene such a the transcription factor which is involved in speech development have undergone rapid evolution in the human lineage a draft version of the chimpanzee genome wa published on september by the chimpanzee sequencing and analysis consortiumthe dna sequence difference between human and chimpanzee consist of about million change five million event and various chromosomal rearrangement typical human and chimp protein homologs differ in an average of only two amino acid about of all human protein are identical in sequence to the corresponding chimp protein duplication of small part of chromosome have been the major source of difference between human and chimp genetic material about of the corresponding modern genome represent difference produced by gene duplication or deletion since human and chimp diverged from their common evolutionary ancestor physical attribute adult chimpanzee have an average standing height of cm ft in wild adult male weigh between kg lb with female weighing between kg lb male in captivity can be overweight reaching weight up to kg lb the chimpanzee is more robustly built than the bonobo but le than the gorilla the arm of a chimp are longer than it leg and can reach below the knee the hand have long finger with short thumb and flat fingernail the foot are adapted for grasping the big toe being opposable the pelvis is long with an extended ilium a chimp head is rounded with a prominent and prognathous face and a pronounced brow ridge it ha eye a small nose rounded ear a long mobile upper lip and in adult male sharp canine teeth chimp lack the prominent sagittal crest and associated head and neck musculature of gorillaschimpanzee body are covered by coarse hair except for the face finger toe palm of the hand and sol of the foot chimp lose more hair a they age and develop bald spot the hair of a chimp is typically black but can be brown or ginger a they get older white or grey patch may appear particularly on the chin and lower region the skin may range from pale to dark female develop swelling pink skin when in oestruschimpanzees are adapted for both arboreal and terrestrial locomotion arboreal locomotion consists of vertical climbing and brachiation on the ground chimp move both quadrupedally and bipedally which appear to have similar energy cost a with bonobo and gorilla chimp move quadrupedally by which probably evolved independently in pan and gorilla the physical strength of chimp is around time greater than human due to higher content of fast twitch muscle fibre one of the chimpanzee adaptation for climbing and swinging ecology the chimpanzee is a highly adaptable specie it life in a variety of habitat including dry savanna evergreen rainforest montane forest swamp forest and dry mosaic in gombe the chimpanzee mostly us semideciduous and evergreen forest a well a open woodland at bossou the chimpanzee inhabits multistage secondary deciduous forest which have grown after shifting cultivation a well a primary forest and grassland at tai it is found in the last remaining tropical rain forest in ivory coast the chimpanzee ha an advanced cognitive map of it home range and can repeatedly find food the chimpanzee make a night nest in a tree in a new location every night with every chimpanzee in a separate nest other than infant or juvenile chimpanzee which sleep with their mother diet the chimpanzee is an omnivorous frugivore it prefers fruit above all other food item but also eats leaf and leaf bud seed blossom stem pith bark and resin a study in budongo forest uganda found that of their chimp feeding time concentrated on fruit of which being ripe particularly those from two specie of ficus maesopsis eminii and celtis durandii in addition of feeding time wa spent on arboreal leaf mostly broussonetia papyrifera and celtis mildbraedii while the chimpanzee is mostly herbivorous it doe eat honey soil insect bird and their egg and small to mammal including other primate insect specie consumed include the weaver ant oecophylla longinoda macrotermes termite and honey bee the western red colobus rank at the top of preferred mammal prey other mammalian prey include monkey infant and juvenile yellow baboon bush baby blue duikers bushbuck and common warthogsdespite the fact that chimpanzee are known to hunt and to collect insect and other invertebrate such food actually make up a very small portion of their diet from a little a yearly to a much a gram of animal flesh per day for each adult chimpanzee in peak hunting season this also varies from troop to troop and year to year however in all case the majority of their diet consists of fruit leaf root and other plant matter female chimpanzee appear to consume much le animal flesh than male according to several study jane goodall documented many occasion within gombe stream national park of chimpanzee and western red colobus monkey ignoring each other within close proximitychimpanzees do not appear to directly compete with gorilla in area where they overlap when fruit is abundant gorilla and chimp diet converge but when fruit is scarce gorilla resort to vegetation the two ape may also feed on different specie whether fruit or insect chimp and gorilla usually ignore or avoid each other when feeding on the same tree although hostile encounter have occasionally been documented mortality and health the average lifespan of a chimpanzee in the wild is relatively short usually le than year although individual that reach year may live an additional wild individual may live over year and on rare occasion around year captive chimp tend to live longer with average lifespan of year for male and year for female the oldest known captive chimp to have been documented lived to yearsleopards prey on chimpanzee in some area it is possible that much of the mortality caused by leopard can be attributed to individual that have specialised in chimp may react to a leopard presence with loud vocalising branch shaking and throwing object there is at least one record of chimp killing a leopard cub after mobbing it and it mother in their den four chimpanzee could have fallen prey to lion at mahale mountain national park although no other instance of lion predation on chimpanzee have been recorded lion likely do kill chimp occasionally and the larger group size of savanna chimp may have developed a a response to threat from these big cat chimp may react to lion by fleeing up tree vocalising or hiding in silence chimp and human share only of their parasite and microbe specie this is due to the difference in environmental and dietary adaptation human internal parasite specie overlap more with omnivorous baboon the chimpanzee is host to the louse specie pediculus schaeffi a close relative of p humanus which infests human head and body hair by contrast the human pubic louse pthirus pubis is closely related to pthirus gorillae which infests gorilla a study of gastrointestinal parasite of wild chimp in degraded forest in uganda found nine specie of protozoa five nematode one cestode and one trematode the most prevalent specie wa the protozoan troglodytella abrassarti behaviour recent study have suggested that human observer influence chimpanzee behaviour one suggestion is that drone camera trap and remote microphone should be used to record and monitor chimpanzee rather than direct observation group structure chimpanzee live in community that typically range from to more than member but spend most of their time travelling in small temporary group consisting of a few individual which may consist of any combination of age and sex class both male and female sometimes travel alone this society may include group of four type adult female and offspring both sex or one female and her offspring these smaller group emerge in a variety of type for a variety of purpose for example an troop may be organised to hunt for meat while a group consisting of lactating female serf to act a a nursery group for the youngat the core of social structure are male which roam around protect group member and search for food male remain in their natal community while female generally emigrate at adolescence a such male in a community are more likely to be related to one another than female are to each other among male there is generally a dominance hierarchy and male are dominant over female however this unusual social structure in which portion of the parent group may on a regular basis separate from and then rejoin the rest is highly variable in term of which particular individual chimpanzee congregate at a given time this is caused mainly by the large measure of individual autonomy that individual have within their social group a a result individual chimpanzee often forage for food alone or in smaller group a opposed to the much larger parent group which encompasses all the chimpanzee which regularly come into contact and congregate into party in a particular area male chimpanzee exist in a linear dominance hierarchy male tend to be aggressive even during dominance stability this is probably due to the chimp society with male chimp leaving group and returning after extended period of time with this a dominant male is unsure if any political maneuvering ha occurred and must his dominance thus a large amount of aggression occurs minute after a reunion during aggressive encounter display are preferred to attack while chimpanzee social structure is often referred to a patriarchal it is not entirely unheard of for female to forge coalition against male there is also at least one recorded case of female securing a dominant position over male in their respective troop albeit in a captive environment male maintain and improve their social rank by forming coalition which have been characterised a exploitative and are based on an individual influence in agonistic interaction being in a coalition allows male to dominate a third individual when they could not by themselves a politically apt chimp can exert power over aggressive interaction regardless of their rank coalition can also give an individual male the confidence to challenge a dominant male the more ally a male ha the better his chance of becoming dominant however most change in hierarchical rank are caused by dyadic interaction chimpanzee alliance can be very fickle and one member may turn on another if it benefit male commonly switch side in dispute between more dominant individual male benefit from an unstable hierarchy and have increased sexual opportunity if there is one in addition conflict between dominant male cause them to focus on each other rather than the male social hierarchy among adult female tend to be weaker nevertheless the status of an adult female may be important for her offspring female in tai have also been recorded to form alliance social grooming appears to be important in the formation and maintenance of coalition it is more common among adult male than adult female and between male and femaleschimpanzees have been described a highly territorial and will kill other chimp although margaret power wrote in her book the egalitarian that the field study from which the aggressive data came gombe and mahale used artificial feeding system that increased aggression in the chimpanzee population studied and might not reflect innate characteristic of the specie a a whole a such in the year following her artificial feeding condition at gombe jane goodall described group of male chimp patrolling the border of their territory brutally attacking chimp which had split off from the gombe group a study published in found that the chimpanzee wage war over land not mate patrol party from smaller group are more likely to avoid contact with their neighbour patrol party from large group even take over a smaller group territory gaining access to more resource food and female while it wa traditionally accepted that only female chimpanzee immigrate and male remain in their natal troop for life there are confirmed case of adult male safely integrating themselves into new community among west african chimpanzee suggesting they are le territorial than other subspecies mating and parenting chimpanzee mate throughout the year although the number of female in oestrus varies seasonally in a group female chimp are more likely to come into oestrus when food is readily available oestrous female exhibit sexual swelling chimp are promiscuous during oestrus female mate with several male in their community while male have large testicle for sperm competition other form of mating also exist a community dominant male sometimes restrict reproductive access to female a male and female can form a consortship and mate outside their community in addition female sometimes leave their community and mate with male from neighboring communitiesthese alternative mating strategy give female more mating opportunity without losing the support of the male in their community infanticide ha been recorded in chimp community in some area and the victim are often consumed male chimp practice infanticide on unrelated young to shorten the interbirth interval in the female female sometimes practice infanticide this may be related to the dominance hierarchy in female or may simply be pathologicalcopulation is brief lasting approximately second the gestation period is eight month care for the young is provided mostly by their mother the survival and emotional health of the young is dependent on maternal care mother provide their young with food warmth and protection and teach them certain skill in addition a chimp future rank may be dependent on it mother status newborn chimp are helpless their grasping reflex is not strong enough to support them for more than a few second for their first day infant cling to their mother belly infant are unable to support their own weight for their first two month and need their mother supportwhen they reach five to six month infant ride on their mother back they remain in continual contact for the rest of their first year when they reach two year of age they are able to move and sit independently and start moving beyond the arm reach of their mother by four to six year chimp are weaned and infancy end the juvenile period for chimp last from their sixth to ninth year juvenile remain close to their mother but interact an increasing amount with other member of their community adolescent female move between group and are supported by their mother in agonistic encounter adolescent male spend time with adult male in social activity like hunting and boundary patrolling a captive study suggests male can safely immigrate to a new group if accompanied by immigrant female who have an existing relationship with this male this give the resident male reproductive advantage with these female a they are more inclined to remain in the group if their male friend is also accepted communication chimpanzee use facial expression posture and sound to communicate with each other chimp have expressive face that are important in communication when frightened a full closed grin cause nearby individual to be fearful a well playful chimp display an grin chimp may also express themselves with the pout which is made in distress the sneer which is made when threatening or fearful and face which is a type of display when submitting to a dominant individual a chimp crunch bob and extends a hand when in an aggressive mode a chimp swagger bipedally hunched over and arm waving in an attempt to exaggerate it size while travelling chimp keep in contact by beating their hand and foot against the trunk of large tree an act that is known a drumming they also do this when encountering individual from other communitiesvocalisations are also important in chimp communication the most common call in adult is the which may signal social rank and bond a well keep group together are made of four part starting with soft hoos the introduction that get louder and louder the and climax into scream and sometimes bark these die down back to soft hoos during the letdown phase a the call end grunting is made in situation like feeding and greeting submissive individual make towards their superior whimpering is made by young chimp a a form of begging or when lost from the group chimp use distance call to draw attention to danger food source or other community member bark may be made a short bark when hunting and tonal bark when sighting large snake hunting when hunting small monkey such a the red colobus chimpanzee hunt where the forest canopy is interrupted or irregular this allows them to easily corner the monkey when chasing them in the appropriate direction chimp may also hunt a a coordinated team so that they can corner their prey even in a continuous canopy during an arboreal hunt each chimp in the hunting group ha a role driver serve to keep the prey running in a certain direction and follow them without attempting to make a catch blocker are stationed at the bottom of the tree and climb up to block prey that take off in a different direction chaser move quickly and try to make a catch finally ambusher hide and rush out when a monkey nears while both adult and infant are taken adult male colobus monkey will attack the hunting chimp male chimp hunt more than female when caught and killed the meal is distributed to all hunting party member and even bystander intelligence and cognition chimpanzee display numerous sign of intelligence from the ability to remember symbol to cooperation tool use and perhaps language they are among specie that have passed the mirror test suggesting in one study two young chimpanzee showed retention of mirror after one year without access to mirror chimp also display sign of culture among group with the learning and transmission of variation in grooming tool use and foraging technique leading to localised traditionsa study at kyoto university primate research institute ha shown that chimp are able to learn to recognise the number to and their value the chimp further show an aptitude for photographic memory demonstrated in experiment in which the jumbled digit are flashed onto a computer screen for le than a quarter of a second one chimp ayumu wa able to correctly and quickly point to the position where they appeared in ascending order ayumu performed better than human adult who were given the same testin controlled experiment on cooperation chimpanzee show a basic understanding of cooperation and recruit the best collaborator in a group setting with a device that delivered food reward only to cooperating chimpanzee cooperation first increased then due to competitive behaviour decreased before finally increasing to the highest level through punishment and other arbitrage behavioursgreat ape show vocalisation in response to physical contact such a wrestling play chasing or tickling this is documented in wild and captive chimpanzee chimpanzee laughter is not readily recognisable to human a such because it is generated by alternating inhalation and exhalation that sound more like breathing and panting instance in which nonhuman primate have expressed joy have been reported human and chimpanzee share similar ticklish area of the body such a the armpit and belly the enjoyment of tickling in chimpanzee doe not diminish with agechimpanzees have displayed different behaviour in response to a dying or dead group member when witnessing a sudden death the other group member act in frenzy with vocalisation aggressive display and touching of the corpse in one case chimp cared for a dying elder then attended and cleaned the corpse afterward they avoided the spot where the elder died and behaved in a more subdued manner mother have been reported to carry around and groom their dead infantsexperimenters however now and then witness behaviour that can not be readily reconciled with chimpanzee intelligence or theory of mind wolfgang kohler for instance reported insightful behaviour in chimpanzee but he likewise often observed that they experienced special difficulty in solving simple problem researcher also reported that when faced with a choice between two person chimpanzee were just a likely to beg food from a person who could see the begging gesture a from a person who could not thereby raising the possibility that chimpanzee lack theory of mind tool use nearly all chimpanzee population have been recorded using tool they modify stick rock grass and leaf and use them when foraging for termite ant nut honey or water despite the lack of complexity forethought and skill are apparent in making these tool chimpanzee have used stone tool since at least year agoa chimpanzee from the kasakela chimpanzee community wa the first nonhuman animal reported making a tool by modifying a twig to use a an instrument for extracting termite from their mound at tai chimp simply use their hand to extract termite when foraging for honey chimp use modified short stick to scoop the honey out of the hive that is if the bee are stingless for hive of the dangerous african honeybee chimp use longer and thinner stick to extract the honeychimps also fish for ant using the same tactic ant dipping is difficult and some chimp never master it west african chimp crack open hard nut with stone or branch some forethought in this activity is apparent a these tool are not found together or where the nut are collected nut cracking is also difficult and must be learned chimp also use leaf a sponge or spoon to drink watera recent study revealed the use of such advanced tool a spear which west african chimpanzee in senegal sharpen with their teeth being used to spear senegal bushbaby out of small hole in tree an eastern chimpanzee ha been observed using a modified branch a a tool to capture a squirrel language scientist have attempted to teach human language to several specie of great ape one early attempt by allen and beatrix gardner in the involved spending month teaching american sign language to a chimpanzee named washoe the gardner reported that washoe learned sign and had spontaneously taught them to other chimpanzee over a longer period of time washoe wa reported to have learned over signsdebate is ongoing among scientist such a david premack about chimpanzee ability to learn language since the early report on washoe numerous other study have been conducted with varying level of success one involved a chimpanzee jokingly named nim chimpsky in allusion to the theorist of language noam chomsky trained by herbert terrace of columbia university although his initial report were quite positive in november terrace and his team including psycholinguist thomas bever the videotape of nim with his trainer analyzing them frame by frame for sign a well a for exact context what wa happening both before and after nim sign in the reanalysis terrace and bever concluded that nim utterance could be explained merely a prompting on the part of the experimenter a well a mistake in reporting the data much of the ape behavior is pure drill he said language still stand a an important definition of the human specie in this reversal terrace now argued nim use of asl wa not like human language acquisition nim never initiated conversation himself rarely introduced new word and simply imitated what the human did more importantly nim word string varied in their ordering suggesting that he wa incapable of syntax nim sentence also did not grow in length unlike human child whose vocabulary and sentence length show a strong positive correlation relation with human in culture chimpanzee are rarely represented in african culture a people regard them a too close to human for comfort the gio people of liberia and the hemba people of the congo have created mask of the animal gio mask are crude and blocky and worn when teaching young people how not to behave the hemba mask have a smile that suggests drunken anger insanity or horror and are worn during ritual at funeral representing the awful reality of death the mask may also serve to guard household and protect both human and plant fertility story have been told of chimp kidnapping and raping womenin western popular culture chimpanzee have occasionally been stereotyped a childlike companion sidekick or clown they are especially suited for the latter role on account of their prominent facial feature long limb and fast movement which human often find amusing accordingly entertainment act featuring chimpanzee dressed up a human with human voice have been traditional staple of circus stage show and tv show like lancelot link secret chimp and the chimp channel from until london zoo followed by several other zoo around the world held a chimpanzee tea party daily inspiring a series of advertisement for pg tip tea featuring such a party animal right group have urged a stop to such act considering them abusive chimpanzee in medium include judy on the television series daktari in the and darwin on the wild thornberrys in the in contrast to the fictional depiction of other animal such a dog a in lassie dolphin flipper horse the black stallion or even other great ape king kong chimpanzee character and action are rarely relevant to the plot depiction of chimpanzee a individual rather than stock character and a central rather than incidental to the plot can be found in science fiction robert a heinlein short story jerry wa a man concern a genetically enhanced chimpanzee suing for better treatment the film conquest of the planet of the ape the third sequel of the film planet of the ape portrays a futuristic revolt of enslaved ape led by the only talking chimpanzee caesar against their human master a pet chimpanzee have traditionally been kept a pet in a few african village especially in the democratic republic of congo in virunga national park in the east of the country the park authority regularly confiscate chimpanzee from people keeping them a pet outside their range chimpanzee are popular a exotic pet despite their strength and aggression even where keeping primate a pet is illegal the exotic pet trade continues to prosper leading to injury from attack use in research hundred of chimpanzee have been kept in laboratory for research most such laboratory either conduct or make the animal available for invasive research defined a inoculation with an infectious agent surgery or biopsy conducted for the sake of research and not for the sake of the chimpanzee drug testing research chimpanzee tend to be used repeatedly over decade for up to year unlike the pattern of use of most laboratory animal two federally funded american laboratory use chimp the yerkes national primate research center at emory university in atlanta georgia and the southwest national primate center in san antonio texas five hundred chimp have been retired from laboratory use in the u and live in animal sanctuary in the u or canada a moratorium wa imposed by the u national institute of health in because too many chimp had been bred for hiv research and it ha been extended annually since with the publication of the chimpanzee genome plan to increase the use of chimp in america were reportedly increasing in some scientist arguing that the federal moratorium on breeding chimp for research should be liftedother researcher argue that chimp either should not be used in research or should be treated differently for instance with legal status a person pascal gagneux an evolutionary biologist and primate expert at the university of california san diego argues given chimpanzee sense of self tool use and genetic similarity to human being study using chimp should follow the ethical guideline used for human subject unable to give consent a recent study suggests chimpanzee which are retired from lab exhibit a form of posttraumatic stress disorder stuart zola director of the yerkes laboratory disagrees he told national geographic i do think we should make a distinction between our obligation to treat humanely any specie whether it a rat or a monkey or a chimpanzee no matter how much we may wish it chimp are not human only one european laboratory the biomedical primate research centre in rijswijk the netherlands used chimpanzee in research it formerly held chimpanzee among primate the dutch ministry of science decided to phase out research at the centre from trial already under way were however allowed to run their coursechimpanzees including the female ai have been studied at the primate research institute of kyoto university japan formerly directed by tetsuro matsuzawa since some chimpanzee are currently held at the facility field study jane goodall undertook the first field study of the chimpanzee begun in tanzania at gombe stream national park in other study begun in include a kortlandt in the eastern democratic republic of the congo and junichiro itani in mahale mountain national park in tanzania current understanding of the specie typical behaviour and social organisation ha been formed largely from goodall ongoing gombe research study attack chimpanzee have attacked human in uganda several attack on child have happened some of them fatal some of these attack may be due to the chimpanzee being intoxicated from alcohol obtained from rural brewing operation and mistaking human child for the western red colobus one of their favourite meal human interaction with chimpanzee may be especially dangerous if the chimpanzee perceive human a potential rival at least six case of chimpanzee snatching and eating human baby are documenteda chimpanzee strength and sharp teeth mean that attack even on adult human can cause severe injury this wa evident after the attack and near death of former nascar driver st james davis who wa mauled by two escaped chimp while he and his wife were celebrating the birthday of their former pet chimp another example of chimpanzee being aggressive toward human occurred in in stamford connecticut when a lb pet chimp named travis attacked his owner friend who lost her hand eye nose and part of her maxilla from the attack human immunodeficiency virus two type of human immunodeficiency virus hiv infect human and is the more virulent and easily transmitted and is the source of the majority of hiv infection throughout the world is largely confined to west africa both type originated in west and central africa jumping from other primate to human ha evolved from a simian immunodeficiency virus sivcpz found in the subspecies p t troglodyte of southern cameroon kinshasa in the democratic republic of congo ha the greatest genetic diversity of so far discovered suggesting the virus ha been there longer than anywhere else crossed specie from a different strain of hiv found in the sooty mangabey monkey in status and conservation the chimpanzee is listed on the iucn red list a an endangered specie chimpanzee are legally protected in most of their range and are found both in and outside national park between and individual are thought to be living in the wild a decrease from about a million chimpanzee in the early biggest threat to the chimpanzee are habitat destruction poaching and disease chimpanzee habitat have been limited by deforestation in both west and central africa road building ha caused habitat degradation and fragmentation of chimpanzee population and may allow poacher more access to area that had not been seriously affected by human although deforestation rate are low in western central africa selective logging may take place outside national parkschimpanzees are a common target for poacher in ivory coast chimpanzee make up of bushmeat sold in urban market they are also taken often illegally for the pet trade and are hunted for medicinal purpose in some area farmer sometimes kill chimpanzee that threaten their crop others are unintentionally maimed or killed by snare meant for other animalsinfectious disease are a main cause of death for chimpanzee they succumb to many disease that afflict human because the two specie are so similar a human
