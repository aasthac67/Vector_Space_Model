the reindeer rangifer tarandus also known a the caribou in north america is a specie of deer with circumpolar distribution native to arctic tundra boreal and mountainous region of northern europe siberia and north america this includes both sedentary and migratory population rangifer herd size varies greatly in different geographic region the taimyr herd of migrating siberian tundra reindeer r t sibiricus in russia is the largest wild reindeer herd in the world varying between and what wa once the second largest herd is the migratory boreal woodland caribou r t caribou george river herd in canada with former variation between and a of january there are fewer than animal estimated to be left in the george river herd a reported by the canadian broadcasting corporation the new york time reported in april of the disappearance of the only herd of southern mountain caribou in the contiguous united state with an expert calling it functionally extinct after the herd size dwindled to a mere three animalsrangifer varies in size and colour from the smallest the svalbard reindeer to the largest the boreal woodland caribou the north american range of caribou extends from alaska through yukon the northwest territory and nunavut into the boreal forest and south through the canadian rockies and the columbia and selkirk mountain the caribou porcupine caribou and peary caribou live in the tundra while the shy boreal woodland caribou prefer the boreal forest the porcupine caribou and the caribou form large herd and undertake lengthy seasonal migration from birthing ground to summer and winter feeding ground in the tundra and taiga the migration of porcupine caribou herd are among the longest of any mammal caribou are also found in kitaa in greenland but the larger herd are in alaska the northwest territory and nunavutsome subspecies are rare and at least one ha already become extinct the queen charlotte island caribou of canada historically the range of the sedentary boreal woodland caribou covered more than half of canada and into the northern state in the u woodland caribou have disappeared from most of their original southern range and were designated a threatened in by the committee on the status of endangered wildlife in canada cosewic environment canada reported in that there were approximately boreal woodland caribou in range remaining in canada environment canada siberian tundra reindeer herd are in decline and rangifer tarandus is considered to be vulnerable by the iucn arctic people have depended on caribou for food clothing and shelter such a the caribou inuit the inuit of the kivalliq region in northern canada the caribou clan in yukon the inupiat the inuvialuit the han the northern tutchone and the who followed the porcupine caribou for millennium hunting wild reindeer and herding of reindeer are important to several arctic and people such a the duhalar for meat hide antler milk and transportation the sami people sapmi have also depended on reindeer herding and fishing for century in sapmi reindeer pull pulksmale and female reindeer can grow antler annually although the proportion of female that grow antler varies greatly between population and season antler are typically larger on male in traditional festive legend santa claus reindeer pull a sleigh through the night sky to help santa claus deliver gift to good child on christmas eve naming carl linnaeus chose the name rangifer for the reindeer genus which albertus magnus used in his de animalibus fol liber cap dicitur rangyfer quasi ramifer this word may go back to the saami word raingo linnaeus chose the word tarandus a the specific epithet making reference to ulisse aldrovandi quadrupedum omnium bisulcorum historia fol cap de tarando however aldrovandi and konrad gesner thought that rangifer and tarandus were two separate animal in any case the tarandos name go back to aristotle and theophrastus the use of the term reindeer and caribou for essentially the same animal can cause confusion but the international union for conservation of nature clearly delineates the issue the world caribou and reindeer are classified a a single specie rangifer tarandus reindeer is the european name for the specie while in north america the specie is known a caribou the word rein is of norse origin the word deer wa originally broader in meaning but became more specific over time in middle english der meant a wild animal of any kind in contrast to cattle the word caribou come through french from the qalipu meaning snow shoveler and referring to it habit of pawing through the snow for foodbecause of it importance to many culture rangifer tarandus and some of it subspecies have name in many language inuktitut is spoken in the eastern arctic and the caribou is known by the name tuktu the gwich in people have over two dozen distinct wordsnames for reindeer in language spoken throughout their former native range taxonomy and evolution the specie taxonomic name rangifer tarandus wa defined by carl linnaeus in the woodland caribou subspecies taxonomic name rangifer tarandus caribou wa defined by gmelin in based on banfield a revision of

reeder agree with valerius geist specialist on large north american mammal that this range actually includes several subspeciesgeist argued that the true woodland caribou the uniformly dark type with the frontally emphasised antler which is scattered thinly along the southern rim of north american caribou distribution ha been incorrectly classified he affirms that the true woodland caribou is very rare in very great difficulty and requires the most urgent of attention in an analysis of mtdna found difference between the caribou from newfoundland labrador southwestern canada and southeastern canada but maintained all in r t cariboumallory and hillis argued that although the taxonomic designation reflect evolutionary event they do not appear to reflect current ecological condition in numerous instance population of the same subspecies have evolved different demographic and behavioural adaptation while population from separate subspecies have evolved similar demographic and behavioural pattern u nderstanding ecotype in relation to existing ecological constraint and release may be more important than the taxonomic relationship between population current classification of rangifer tarandus either with prevailing taxonomy on subspecies designation based on ecotypes or natural population grouping fail to capture the variability of caribou across their range in canada needed for effective specie conservation and management across the range of a specie individual may display considerable morphological genetic and behavioural variability reflective of both plasticity

boreal forest woodland woodland boreal woodland migratory or woodland mountain spacing dispersed or aggregated and migration pattern sedentary or migratory the cycle of the upper pleistocene had a major influence on the evolution of rangifer tarandus and other arctic and specie isolation of rangifer tarandus in refugia during the last glacial the wisconsin in north america and the weichselian in intraspecific genetic variability particularly between the north american and eurasian part of the arctic in kurten reported that the oldest reindeer fossil wa an antler of tundra reindeer type from the sand of sussenborn in the pleistocene gunz period to bp by the period to bp it european range wa very extensive reindeer occurred in spain italy and southern russia reindeer wa particularly abundant in the magdalenian deposit from the late part of the just before the end of the ice age at that time and at the early mesolithic it wa the game animal for many tribe the supply began to get low during the mesolithic when reindeer retired to the north in spite of the great variation all the pleistocene and living reindeer belong to the same specie human started hunting reindeer in the mesolithic and neolithic period and human are today the main predator in many area norway and greenland have unbroken tradition of hunting wild reindeer from the last glacial period until the present day in the mountain of central norway such a jotunheimen it is still possible to find remains of trapping pit guiding fence and bow rest built especially for hunting reindeer these can with some certainty be dated to the migration period although it is not unlikely that they have been in use since the stone age physical characteristic antler in most population both sex grow antler the reindeer is the only cervid specie in which female grow them a well a male androgen play essential role in cervid antler formation the antlerogenic gene in reindeer have more sensitivity to androgen in comparison with other cervidsthere is considerable variation between subspecies in the size of the antler eg they are rather small and spindly in the northernmost subspecies but on average the bull reindeer antler are the second largest of any extant deer after the moose in the largest subspecies the antler of large male can range up to cm in in width and cm in in beam length they have the largest antler relative to body size among living deer specie antler size measured in number of point reflects the nutritional status of the reindeer and climate variation of it environment the number of point on male reindeer increase from birth to five year of age and remains relatively constant from then on in male caribou antler mass but not the number of tine varies in concert with body mass while antler of bull woodland caribou are typically smaller than caribou they can be over one metre across they are flattened compact and relatively dense geist describes them a frontally emphasised antler woodland caribou antler are thicker and broader than those of the caribou and their leg and head are longer bull caribou antler can be significantly larger and wider than other woodland caribou central bull caribou are perhaps the most diverse in configuration and can grow to be very high and wide mountain caribou are typically the most massive with the largest circumference measurementsthe antler main beam begin at the brow extending posterior over the shoulder and bowing so that the tip point forward the prominent palmate brow tine extend forward over the face the antler typically have two separate group of point lower and upper antler begin to grow on male reindeer in march or april and on female reindeer in may or june this process is called antlerogenesis antler grow very quickly every year on the male a the antler grow they are covered in thick velvet filled with blood vessel and spongy in texture the antler velvet of the caribou and boreal woodland caribou is dark chocolate brown the velvet that cover growing antler is a highly vascularised skin this velvet is dark brown on woodland or caribou and on peary caribou and the caribou herd velvet lump in march can develop into a rack measuring more than a metre in length ft by augustwhen the antler growth is fully grown and hardened the velvet is shed or rubbed off to the inuit for whom the caribou is a culturally important keystone specie the month are named after landmark in the caribou life cycle for example amiraijaut in the igloolik region is when velvet fall off caribou antler male reindeer use their antler to compete with other male during the mating season in describing woodland caribou sara wrote during the rut male engage in frequent and furious sparring battle with their antler large male with large antler do most of the mating reindeer continue to migrate until the bull reindeer have spent the back fatin late autumn or early winter after the rut male reindeer lose their antler growing a new pair the next summer with a larger rack than the previous year female reindeer keep their antler until they calve in the scandinavian population old male antler fall off in december young male fall off in the early spring and female fall off in the summer when bull reindeer shed their antler in early to midwinter the antlered female reindeer acquire the highest rank in the feeding hierarchy gaining access to the best forage area these cow are healthier than those without antler calf whose mother do not have antler are more prone to disease and have a significantly higher mortality female in good nutritional condition for example during a mild winter with good winter range quality may grow new antler earlier a antler growth requires high intakeaccording to a respected igloolik elder noah piugaattuk who wa one of the last outpost camp leader caribou tuktu antler get detached every young male lose the velvet from the antler much more quickly than female caribou even though they are not fully mature they start to work with their antler just a soon a the velvet start to fall off the young male engage in fight with their antler towards after the velvet had fallen off they will be red a they start to get bleached their colour when the velvet start to fall off the antler is red because the antler is made from blood the antler is the blood that ha hardened in fact the core of the antler is still bloody when the velvet start to fall off at least close to the base according to the igloolik oral history project iohp caribou antler provided the inuit with a myriad of implement from snow knife and shovel to drying rack and tool a complex set of term describes each part of the antler and relates it to it various us currently the larger rack of antler are used by inuit a material for carving jackoposie oopakak carving entitled nunali which mean place where people live and which is part of the permanent collection of the national gallery of canada includes a massive set of caribou antler on which he ha intricately carved the miniaturised world of the inuit where arctic bird caribou polar bear seal and whale are interspersed with human activity of fishing hunting cleaning skin stretching boot and travelling by dog sled and kayak from the base of the antler to the tip of each branch pelt the colour of the fur varies considerably both between individual and depending on season and subspecies northern population which usually are relatively small are whiter while southern population which typically are relatively large are darker this can be seen well in north america where the northernmost subspecies the peary caribou is the whitest and smallest subspecies of the continent while the southernmost subspecies the boreal woodland caribou is the darkest and largestthe coat ha two layer of fur a dense woolly undercoat and overcoat consisting of hollow hair fur is the primary insulation factor that allows reindeer to regulate their core body temperature in relation to their environment the thermogradient even if the temperature rise to in dugmore noted how the woodland caribou swim so high out of the water unlike any other mammal because their hollow hair act a a supporting life jacket a darker belly color may be caused by two mutation of they appear to be more common in domestic herd heat exchange blood moving into the leg is cooled by blood returning to the body in a countercurrent heat exchange cche a highly efficient mean of minimising heat loss through the skin surface in the cche mechanism in cold weather blood vessel are closely knotted and intertwined with artery to the skin and appendage that carry warm blood with vein returning to the body that carry cold blood causing the warm arterial blood to exchange heat with the cold venous blood in this way their leg for example are kept cool maintaining the core body temperature nearly higher with le heat lost to the environment heat is thus recycled instead of being dissipated the heart doe not have to pump blood a rapidly in order to maintain a constant body core temperature and thus metabolic rate cche is present in animal like reindeer fox and moose living in extreme condition of cold or hot weather a a mechanism for retaining the heat in or out of the body these are countercurrent exchange system with the same fluid usually blood in a circuit used for both direction of flowreindeer have specialised vascular heat exchange in their nasal passage temperature gradient along the nasal mucosa is under physiological control incoming cold air is warmed by body heat before entering the lung and water is condensed from the expired air and captured before the reindeer breath is exhaled then used to moisten dry incoming air and possibly be absorbed into the blood through the mucous membrane like moose caribou have specialised nose featuring nasal turbinate bone that dramatically increase the surface area within the nostril hoof the reindeer ha large foot with cloven hoof for walking in snow or swamp according to the specie at risk public registry sara woodland caribou have large foot with four toe in addition to two small one called dew claw they have two large toe that support most of their weight and serve a shovel when digging for food under snow these large concave hoof offer stable support on wet soggy ground and on crusty snow the pad of the hoof change from a thick fleshy shape in the summer to become hard and thin in the winter month reducing the animal s exposure to the cold ground additional winter protection come from the long hair between the toe it cover the pad so the caribou walk only on the horny rim of the hoof reindeer hoof adapt to the season in the summer when the tundra is soft and wet the footpad become and provide extra traction in the winter the pad shrink and tighten exposing the rim of the hoof which cut into the ice and crusted snow to keep it from slipping this also enables them to dig down an activity known a cratering through the snow to their favourite food a lichen known a reindeer lichen cladonia rangiferina size the female usually measure cm in in length and weigh kg lb the male or bull a they are often called are typically larger to an extent which varies between the different subspecies measuring cm in in length and usually weighing kg lb exceptionally large male have weighed a much a kg lb weight varies drastically between season with male losing a much a of their weightshoulder height is usually to cm to in and the tail is to cm to in long the reindeer from svalbard are the smallest they are also relatively and may have a shoulder height of a little a cm in norwegian polar institute thereby following allen rule clicking sound the knee of many subspecies of reindeer are adapted to produce a clicking sound a they walk the sound originate in the tendon of the knee and may be audible from ten meter away the frequency of the is one of a range of signal that establish relative position on a dominance scale among reindeer specifically loud is discovered to be an honest signal of body size providing an exceptional example of the potential for acoustic communication in mammal the clicking sound made by reindeer a they walk is caused by small tendon slipping over bone protuberance sesamoid bone in their foot the sound is made when a reindeer is walking or running occurring when the full weight of the foot is on the ground or just after it is relieved of the weight eye a study by researcher from university college london in revealed that reindeer can see light with wavelength a short a nm ie in the ultraviolet range considerably below the human threshold of nm it is thought that this ability help them to survive in the arctic because many object that blend into the landscape in light visible to human such a urine and fur produce sharp contrast in ultraviolet the tapetum lucidum of arctic reindeer eye change in colour from gold in summer to blue in winter to improve their vision during time of continuous darkness and perhaps enable them to better spot predator biology and behaviour seasonal body composition reindeer have developed adaptation for optimal metabolic efficiency during warm month a well a for during cold month the body composition of reindeer varies highly with the season of particular interest is the body composition and diet of breeding and female between season breeding female have more body mass than female between the month of march and september with a difference of around kg more than female from november to december female have more body mass than breeding female a female are able to focus their energy towards storage during colder month rather than lactation and reproduction body mass of both breeding and female peak in september during the month of march through april breeding female have more fat mass than the female with a difference of almost kg after this however nonbreeding female on average have a higher fat mass than the breeding femalesthe environmental variation play a large part in reindeer nutrition a winter nutrition is crucial to adult and neonatal survival rate lichen are a staple during the winter month a they are a readily available food source which reduces the reliance on stored body reserve lichen are a crucial part of the reindeer diet however they are le prevalent in the diet of pregnant reindeer compared to individual the amount of lichen in a diet is found more in adult diet than pregnant individual due to the lack of nutritional value although lichen are high in carbohydrate they are lacking in essential protein that vascular plant provide the amount of lichen in a diet decrease in latitude which result in nutritional stress being higher in area with low lichen abundance reproduction and reindeer mate in late september to early november and the gestation period is about day during the mating season male battle for access to female two male will lock each other antler together and try to push each other away the most dominant male can collect a many a female to mate with a male will stop eating during this time and lose much of his body reservesto calve female travel to isolated relatively area such a island in lake peatlands lakeshore or tundra a female select the habitat for the birth of their calf they are more wary than male dugmore noted that in their seasonal migration the herd follows a doe for that reason newborn weigh on average kg lb in may or june the calf are born after day the calf are able to graze and forage but continue suckling until the following autumn when they become independent from their mothersmales live four year le than the female whose maximum longevity is about year female with a normal body size and who have had sufficient summer nutrition can begin breeding anytime between the age of one to three year when a female ha undergone nutritional stress it is possible for her to not reproduce for the year dominant male those with larger body size and antler rack inseminate more than one doe a season social structure migration and range some population of north american caribou for example many herd in the caribou subspecies and some woodland caribou in ungava and labrador migrate the farthest of any terrestrial mammal travelling up to km mi a year and covering sq mi other north american population the boreal woodland caribou for example are largely sedentary the european population are known to have shorter migration island herd such a the subspecies r t pearsoni and r t platyrhynchus make local movement migrating reindeer can be negatively affected by parasite load severely infected individual are weak and probably have shortened lifespan but parasite level vary between population infection create an effect known a culling infected migrating animal are le likely to complete the migrationnormally travelling about km mi a day while migrating the caribou can run at speed of mph young caribou can already outrun an olympic sprinter when only a day old during the spring migration smaller herd will group together to form larger herd of to animal but during autumn migration the group become smaller and the reindeer begin to mate during winter reindeer travel to forested area to forage under the snow by spring group leave their winter ground to go to the calving ground a reindeer can swim easily and quickly normally at about mph but if necessary at mph and migrating herd will not hesitate to swim across a large lake or broad river a an adaptation to their arctic environment they have lost their circadian rhythm ecology distribution and habitat originally the reindeer wa found in scandinavia eastern europe greenland russia mongolia and northern china north of the latitude in north america it wa found in canada alaska and the northern conterminous usa from washington to maine in the century it wa apparently still present in southern idaho even in historical time it probably occurred naturally in ireland during the late pleistocene era reindeer occurred a far south a nevada and tennessee in north america and a far south a spain in europe today wild reindeer have disappeared from these area especially from the southern part where it vanished almost everywhere large population of wild reindeer are still found in norway finland siberia greenland alaska and canada according to the grubb rangifer tarandus is circumboreal in the tundra and taiga from svalbard norway finland russia alaska usa and canada including most arctic island and greenland south to northern mongolia china inner mongolia now only domesticated or feral sakhalin island and usa northern idaho and the great lake region reindeer were introduced to and feral in iceland kerguelen island south georgia island pribilof island st matthew island there is strong regional variation in rangifer herd size there are large population difference among individual herd and the size of individual herd ha varied greatly since the largest of all herd in taimyr russia ha varied between and the second largest herd at the george river in canada ha varied between and while rangifer is a widespread and numerous genus in the northern holarctic being present in both tundra and taiga boreal forest by many herd had unusually low number and their winter range in particular were smaller than they used to be caribou and reindeer number have fluctuated historically but many herd are in decline across their range this global decline is linked to climate change for northern migratory herd and industrial disturbance of habitat for herd caribou are susceptible to the effect of climate change due to a mismatch in the phenological process between the availability of food during the calving period in november it wa reported that more than reindeer in russia had died a a result of climate change longer autumn leading to increased amount of freezing rain created a few inch of ice over lichen starving many reindeer diet reindeer are ruminant having a stomach they mainly eat lichen in winter especially reindeer lichen a unique adaptation among mammal they are the only large mammal able to metabolise lichen owing to specialised bacteria and protozoa in their gut they are the only animal except for some gastropod in which the enzyme lichenase which break down lichenin to glucose ha been found however they also eat the leaf of willow and birch a well a sedge and grass they have been known to eat their own fallen antler probably for calcium there is also some evidence to suggest that on occasion especially in the spring when they are nutritionally stressed they will feed on small rodent such a lemming fish such a arctic char and bird egg reindeer herded by the chukchi have been known to devour mushroom enthusiastically in late summerduring the arctic summer when there is continuous daylight reindeer change their sleeping pattern from one synchronised with the sun to an ultradian pattern in which they sleep when they need to digest food predator a variety of predator prey heavily on reindeer including overhunting by people in some area which contributes to the decline of populationsgolden eagle prey on calf and are the most prolific hunter on the calving ground wolverine will take newborn calf or birthing cow a well a le commonly infirm adult brown bear and polar bear prey on reindeer of all age but like the wolverine they are most likely to attack weaker animal such a calf and sick reindeer since healthy adult reindeer can usually outpace a bear the grey wolf is the most effective natural predator of adult reindeer and sometimes take large number especially during the winter some wolf pack a well a individual grizzly bear in canada may follow and live off of a particular reindeer herd year roundadditionally a carrion reindeer may be scavenged opportunistically by fox hawk and raven bloodsucking insect such a mosquito culicidae black fly simuliidae and botfly and deer botfly oestridae specifically the reindeer warble fly hypoderma tarandi and the reindeer nose botfly cephenemyia trompe are a plague to reindeer during the summer and can cause enough stress to inhibit feeding and calving behaviour an adult reindeer will lose perhaps about liter about u pint of blood to biting insect for every week it spends in the tundra the population number of some of these predator is influenced by the migration of reindeer tormenting insect keep caribou on the move searching for windy area like hilltop and mountain ridge rock reef lakeshore and forest opening or snow patch that offer respite from the buzzing horde gathering in large herd is another strategy that caribou use to block insectsin one case the entire body of a reindeer wa found in the stomach of a greenland shark a specie found in the far northern atlantic although this wa possibly a case of scavenging considering the dissimilarity of habitat between the ungulate and the large fish other threat deer odocoileus virginianus commonly carry meningeal worm or brainworm a nematode parasite that cause reindeer moose alces alces elk cervus canadensis and mule deer odocoileus hemionus to develop fatal neurological symptom which include a loss of fear of human deer that carry this worm are partly immune to itchanges in climate and habitat beginning in the twentieth century have expanded range overlap between deer and caribou increasing the frequency of infection within the reindeer population this increase in infection is a concern for wildlife manager human activity such a forestry practice forest fire and the clearing for agriculture roadway railway and power line favour the conversion of habitat into the preferred habitat of the open forest interspersed with meadow clearing grassland and riparian flatlands conservation current status while overall widespread and numerous some subspecies are rare and at least one ha already gone extinct a of the iucn ha classified the reindeer a vulnerable due to an observed population decline of over the last year according to iucn rangifer tarandus a a specie is not endangered because of it overall large population and it widespread rangein north america r t dawsoni is extinct r t pearyi is endangered r t caribou is designated a threatened and some individual population are endangered while the subspecies r t granti and r t groenlandicus are not designated a threatened many individual some of the declining and there is much concern at the local levelrangifer tarandus is endangered in canada in region such a british columbia at the border along the columbia kootenay and kootenai river and around kootenay lake rangifer tarandus is endangered in the united state in idaho and washington there is strong regional variation in rangifer herd size by many caribou herd in north america had unusually low number and their winter range in particular were smaller than they used to be caribou number have fluctuated historically but many herd are in decline across their range there are many factor contributing to the decline in number boreal woodland caribou cosewic designation a threatened ongoing human development of their habitat ha caused population of woodland caribou to disappear from their original southern range in particular caribou were extirpated in many area of eastern north america in the beginning of the century woodland caribou were designated a threatened in environment canada reported in that there were approximately boreal woodland caribou in range remaining in canada environment canada professor marco musiani of the university of calgary said in a statement that the woodland caribou is already an endangered specie in southern canada and the united state the warming of the planet mean the disappearance of their critical habitat in these region caribou need undisturbed environment and these type of habitat are disappearing woodland caribou have disappeared from most of their original southern range and were designated a threatened in by the committee on the status of endangered wildlife in canada cosewic environment canada reported in that there were approximately boreal woodland caribou in range remaining in canada environment canada according to geist the woodland caribou is highly endangered throughout it distribution right into ontario in the population of the woodland caribou wa designated a endangered by cosewic the small isolated population of animal wa at risk from predation and habitat loss peary caribou cosewic designation a endangered in cosewic assigned endangered status to the bank island and high arctic population of peary caribou the low arctic population of peary caribou wa designated a threatened by all three were designated a endangered number have declined by about over the last three generation mostly because of catastrophic likely related to severe icing episode the ice cover the vegetation and caribou starve voluntary restriction on hunting by local people are in place but have not stopped population decline because of the continuing decline and expected change in weather pattern this subspecies is at imminent risk of extinction relationship with human the reindeer ha an important economic role for all circumpolar people including the saami the nenets the khants the evenk the yukaghirs the chukchi and the koryaks in eurasia it is believed that domestication started between the bronze and iron age siberian reindeer owner also use the reindeer to ride on siberian reindeer are larger than their scandinavian relative for breeder a single owner may own hundred or even thousand of animal the number of russian reindeer herder have been drastically reduced since the fall of the soviet union the sale of fur and meat is an important source of income reindeer were introduced into alaska near the end of the century they interbred with the native caribou subspecies there reindeer herder on the seward peninsula have experienced significant loss to their herd from animal such a wolf following the wild caribou during their migrationsreindeer meat is popular in the scandinavian country reindeer meatball are sold canned sauteed reindeer is the dish in sapmi in alaska and finland reindeer sausage is sold in supermarket and grocery store reindeer meat is very tender and lean it can be prepared fresh but also dried salted and and in addition to meat almost all of the internal organ of reindeer can be eaten some being traditional dish furthermore lapin poron liha fresh reindeer meat completely produced and packed in finnish sapmi is protected in europe with pdo classificationreindeer antler are powdered and sold a an aphrodisiac or a an nutritional or medicinal supplement to asian market the blood of the caribou wa supposedly mixed with alcohol a drink by hunter and logger in colonial quebec to counter the cold this drink is now enjoyed without the blood a a wine and whiskey drink known a caribou reindeer and indigenous people wild reindeer are still hunted in greenland and in north america in the traditional lifestyle of the inuit people the northern first nation people the alaska native and the kalaallit of greenland reindeer is an important source of food clothing shelter and tool the caribou inuit are inuit in nunavut keewatin region canada now known a the kivalliq region they subsisted on caribou eating dried caribou meat in the winter the ihalmiut are caribou inuit that followed the qamanirjuaq caribou herdthere is an inuit saying in the kivalliq region the caribou feed the wolf but it is the wolf who keep the caribou strong elder chief of koyukuk and chair for the western arctic caribou herd working group benedict jones or k ughto oodenool o represents the middle yukon river alaska his grandmother wa a member of the caribou clan who travelled with the caribou a a mean to survive in they were living the traditional life style at one of their hunting camp in koyukuk near the location of what is now the koyukuk national wildlife refuge his grandmother made a pair of new mukluks in one day k ughto oodenool o recounted a story told by an elder who worked on the steamboat during the gold rush day out on the yukon in late august the caribou migrated from the alaska range up north to huslia koyukuk and the tanana area one year when the steamboat wa unable to continue they ran into a caribou herd numbering estimated at a million animal migrating across yukon they tied up for seven day waiting for the caribou to cross they ran out of wood for the steamboat and had to go back down mile to the wood pile to pick up some more wood on the tenth day they came back and they said there wa still caribou going across the river night and day the the indigenous people of northwestern canada and northeastern alaska have been dependent on the international migratory porcupine caribou herd for millennium to them the cultural symbol and a keystone subsistence specie of the just a the buffalo is to the plain indian innovative language revitalisation project are underway to document the language and to enhance the writing and translation skill of younger speaker in one project lead research associate and fluent speaker gwich in elder kenneth frank work with linguist which include young speaker affiliated with the alaska native language center at the university of alaska in fairbanks to document traditional knowledge of caribou anatomy the main goal of the research wa to elicit not only what the know about caribou anatomy but how they see caribou and what they say and believe about caribou that defines themselves their dietary and nutritional need and their subsistence way of life elder have identified at least descriptive name for all of the bone organ and tissue associated with the caribou anatomy are not just descriptive name for all of the body part including bone organ and tissue but also an encyclopedia of story song game toy ceremony traditional tool skin clothing personal name and surname and a highly developed ethnic cuisine in the traditional management practice were established to protect the porcupine caribou upon which the people depend they codified traditional principle of caribou management into tribal law which include limit on the harvest of caribou and procedure to be followed in processing and transporting caribou meat and limit on the number of caribou to be taken per hunting trip reindeer husbandry the reindeer is the only domesticated deer in the world though it may be more accurate to consider reindeer a reindeer in northern fennoscandia northern norway sweden and finland a well in the kola peninsula and yakutia in russia are all domestic reindeer rangifer tarandus f domesticus by their owner some reindeer in the area are truly domesticated mostly used a draught animal nowadays commonly for tourist entertainment and race
