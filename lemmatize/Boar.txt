the wild boar sus scrofa also known a the wild swine common wild pig or simply wild pig is a suid native to much of eurasia and north africa and ha been introduced to the america and oceania the specie is now one of the mammal in the world a well a the most widespread suiform it ha been assessed a least concern on the iucn red list due to it wide range high number and adaptability to a diversity of habitat it ha become an invasive specie in part of it introduced range wild boar probably originated in southeast asia during the early pleistocene and outcompeted other suid specie a they spread throughout the old worldas of up to subspecies are recognized which are divided into four regional grouping based on skull height and lacrimal bone length the specie life in matriarchal society consisting of interrelated female and their young both male and female fully grown male are usually solitary outside the breeding season the grey wolf is the wild boar main predator in most of it natural range except in the far east and the lesser sunda island where it is replaced by the tiger and komodo dragon respectively the wild boar ha a long history of association with human having been the ancestor of most domestic pig breed and a animal for millennium boar have also in recent decade with feral pig these hybrid have become a serious pest wild animal in the america and australia terminology a true wild boar became extinct in great britain before the development of modern english the same term are often used for both true wild boar and pig especially large or one the english stem from the old english bar which is thought to be derived from the west germanic bairaz of unknown origin boar is sometimes used specifically to refer to male and may also be used to refer to male domesticated pig especially breeding male that have not been castrated the traditional name for a female again come from old english and germanic it stem from and is related to the latin sus and greek hus and more closely to the new high german sau the young may be called the animal specific name scrofa is latin for hunting in hunting terminology boar are given different designation according to their age taxonomy and evolution mtdna study indicate that the wild boar originated from island in southeast asia such a indonesia and the philippine and subsequently spread onto mainland eurasia and north africa the earliest fossil find of the specie come from both europe and asia and date back to the early pleistocene by the late villafranchian s scrofa largely displaced the related s strozzii a large possibly suid ancestral to the modern s verrucosus throughout the eurasian mainland restricting it to insular asia it closest wild relative is the bearded pig of malacca and surrounding island subspecies a of subspecies are recognised which are divided into four regional grouping western includes s s scrofa s s meridionalis s s algira s s attila s s lybicus and s s nigripes these subspecies are typically though lybicus and some scrofa are with thick underwool and excepting scrofa and attila poorly developed mane indian includes s s davidi and s s cristatus these subspecies have sparse or absent underwool with long mane and prominent band on the snout and mouth while s s cristatus is s s davidi is eastern includes s s sibiricus s s ussuricus s s leucomystax s s riukiuanus s s taivanus and s s moupinensis these subspecies are characterised by a whitish streak extending from the corner of the mouth to the lower jaw with the exception of s s ussuricus most are the underwool is thick except in s s moupinensis and the mane is largely absent indonesian represented solely by s s vittatus it is characterised by it sparse body hair lack of underwool fairly long mane a broad reddish band extending from the muzzle to the side of the neck it is the most basal of the four group having the smallest relative brain size more primitive dentition and unspecialised cranial structure domestication with the exception of domestic pig in timor and papua new guinea which appear to be of sulawesi warty pig stock the wild boar is the ancestor of most pig breed archaeological evidence suggests that pig were domesticated from wild boar a early a bce in the near east in the tigris basin being managed in the wild in a way similar to the way they are managed by some modern new guinean remains of pig have been dated to earlier than bce in cyprus those animal must have been introduced from the mainland which suggests domestication in the adjacent mainland by then there wa also a separate domestication in china which took place about year agodna evidence from remains of teeth and jawbone of neolithic pig show that the first domestic pig in europe had been brought from the near east this stimulated the domestication of local european wild boar resulting in a third domestication event with the near eastern gene dying out in european pig stock modern domesticated pig have involved complex exchange with european domesticated line being exported in turn to the ancient near east historical record indicate that asian pig were introduced into europe during the and early century domestic pig tend to have much more developed hindquarter than their wild boar ancestor to the point where of their body weight is concentrated in the posterior which is the opposite of wild boar where most of the muscle are concentrated on the head and shoulder physical description the wild boar is a bulky massively built suid with short and relatively thin leg the trunk is short and robust while the hindquarter are comparatively underdeveloped the region behind the shoulder blade rise into a hump and the neck is short and thick to the point of being nearly immobile the animal head is very large taking up to of the body entire length the structure of the head is well suited for digging the head act a a plough while the powerful neck muscle allow the animal to upturn considerable amount of soil it is capable of digging cm in into frozen ground and can upturn rock weighing kg lb the eye are small and and the ear long and broad the specie ha well developed canine teeth which protrude from the mouth of adult male the medial hoof are larger and more elongated than the lateral one and are capable of quick movement the animal can run at a maximum speed of mph and jump at a height of cm in sexual dimorphism is very pronounced in the specie with male being typically larger and heavier than female male also sport a mane running down the back which is particularly apparent during autumn and winter the canine teeth are also much more prominent in male and grow throughout life the upper canine are relatively short and grow sideways early in life though they gradually curve upwards the lower canine are much sharper and longer with the exposed part measuring cm in in length in the breeding period male develop a coating of subcutaneous tissue which may be cm in thick extending from the shoulder blade to the rump thus protecting vital organ during fight male sport a roughly sack near the opening of the penis which collect urine and emits a sharp odour the function of this sack is not fully understood adult size and weight is largely determined by environmental factor boar living in arid area with little productivity tend to attain smaller size than their counterpart inhabiting area with abundant food and water in most of europe male average kg lb in weight cm in in shoulder height and cm in in body length whereas female average kg lb in weight cm in in shoulder height and cm in in body length in europe mediterranean region male may reach average weight a low a kg lb and female kg lb with shoulder height of cm in in the more productive area of eastern europe male average kg lb in weight cm in in shoulder height and cm in in body length while female weigh kg lb reach cm in in shoulder height and cm in in body length in western and central europe the largest male weigh kg lb and female kg lb in northeastern asia large male can reach brown size weighing kg lb and measuring cm in in shoulder height some adult male in ussuriland and manchuria have been recorded to weigh kg lb and measure cm in in shoulder height adult of this size are generally immune from wolf predation such giant are rare in modern time due to past overhunting preventing animal from attaining their full growththe winter coat consists of long coarse bristle underlaid with short brown downy fur the length of these bristle varies along the body with the shortest being around the face and limb and the longest running along the back these back bristle form the aforementioned mane prominent in male and stand erect when the animal is agitated colour is highly variable specimen around lake balkhash are very lightly coloured and can even be white while some boar from belarus and ussuriland can be black some subspecies sport a patch running backward from the corner of the mouth coat colour also varies with age with piglet having light brown or fur with pale band extending from the flank and backthe wild boar produce a number of different sound which are divided into three category contact call grunting noise which differ in intensity according to the situation adult male are usually silent while female frequently grunt and piglet whine when feeding boar express their contentment through purring study have shown that piglet imitate the sound of their mother thus different litter may have unique vocalisation alarm call warning cry emitted in response to threat when frightened boar make loud huffing ukh ukh sound or emit screech transcribed a combat call piercing criesits sense of smell is very well developed to the point that the animal is used for drug detection in germany it hearing is also acute though it eyesight is comparatively weak lacking color vision and being unable to recognise a standing human metre ft away pig are one of four known mammalian specie which posse mutation in the nicotinic acetylcholine receptor that protect against snake venom mongoose honey badger hedgehog and pig all have modification to the receptor pocket which prevents the snake venom from binding these represent four separate independent mutation social behaviour and life cycle boar are typically social animal living in sounder consisting of barren sow and mother with young led by an old matriarch male boar leave their sounder at the age of month while female either remain with their mother or establish new territory nearby subadult male may live in loosely knit group while adult and elderly male tend to be solitary outside the breeding season the breeding period in most area last from november to january though most mating only last a month and a half prior to mating the male develop their subcutaneous armour in preparation for confronting rival the testicle double in size and the gland secrete a foamy yellowish liquid once ready to reproduce male travel long distance in search of a sounder of sow eating little on the way once a sounder ha been located the male drive off all young animal and persistently chase the sow at this point the male fiercely fight potential rival a single male can mate with sow by the end of the rut male are often badly mauled and have lost of their body weight with injury to the penis being common the gestation period varies according to the age of the expecting mother for breeder it last day while it last day in older sow farrowing occurs between march and may with litter size depending on the age and nutrition of the mother the average litter consists of piglet with the maximum being the piglet are whelped in a nest constructed from twig grass and leaf should the mother die prematurely the piglet are adopted by the other sow in the soundernewborn piglet weigh around gram lacking underfur and bearing a single milk incisor and canine on each half of the jaw there is intense competition between the piglet over the most nipple a the young grow faster and have stronger constitution the piglet do not leave the lair for their first week of life should the mother be absent the piglet lie closely pressed to each other by two week of age the piglet begin accompanying their mother on her journey should danger be detected the piglet take cover or stand immobile relying on their camouflage to keep them hidden the neonatal coat fade after three month with adult colouration being attained at eight month although the lactation period last month the piglet begin displaying adult feeding behaviour at the age of week the permanent dentition is fully formed by year with the exception of the canine in male the teeth stop growing during the middle of the fourth year the canine in old male continue to grow throughout their life curving strongly a they age sow attain sexual maturity at the age of one year with male attaining it a year later however estrus usually first occurs after two year in sow while male begin participating in the rut after year a they are not permitted to mate by the older male the maximum lifespan in the wild is year though few specimen survive past year boar in captivity have lived for year ecology habitat and sheltering behaviour the wild boar inhabits a diverse array of habitat from boreal taigas to desert in mountainous region it can even occupy alpine zone occurring up to m ft in the carpathians m ft in the caucasus and up to m ft in the mountain in central asia and kazakhstan in order to survive in a given area wild boar require a habitat fulfilling three condition heavily brushed area providing shelter from predator water for drinking and bathing purpose and an absence of regular snowfallthe main habitat favored by boar in europe are deciduous and mixed forest with the most favorable area consisting of forest composed of oak and beech enclosing marsh and meadow in the bialowieza forest the animal primary habitat consists of and mixed forest along with marshy mixed forest with coniferous forest and undergrowth being of secondary importance forest made up entirely of oak grove and beech are used only during the season this is in contrast to the caucasian and transcaucasian mountain area where boar will occupy such forest in the mountainous area of the russian far east the specie inhabits nutpine grove hilly mixed forest where mongolian oak and korean pine are present swampy mixed taiga and coastal oak forest in transbaikalia boar are restricted to river valley with nut pine and shrub boar are regularly encountered in pistachio grove in winter in some area of tajikistan and turkmenistan while in spring they migrate to open desert boar have also colonized desert in several area they have been introduced toon the island of komodo and rinca the boar mostly inhabits savanna or open monsoon forest avoiding heavily forested area unless pursued by human wild boar are known to be competent swimmer capable of covering long distance in one boar wa reported to have completed the mi swim from france to alderney in the channel island due to concern about disease it wa shot and incineratedwild boar rest in shelter which contain insulating material like spruce branch and dry hay these resting place are occupied by whole family though male lie separately and are often located in the vicinity of stream in swamp forest and in tall grass or shrub thicket boar never defecate in their shelter and will cover themselves with soil and pine needle when irritated by insect diet the wild boar is a highly versatile omnivore whose diversity in choice of food is comparable to that of human their food can be divided into four category rhizome root tuber and bulb all of which are dug up throughout the year in the animal whole range nut berry and seed which are consumed when ripened and are dug up from the snow when abundant leaf bark twig and shoot along with garbage earthworm insect mollusk fish rodent insectivore bird egg lizard snake frog and carrion most of these prey item are taken in warm periodsa kg lb boar need around calorie of food per day though this required amount increase during winter and pregnancy with the majority of it diet consisting of food item dug from the ground like underground plant material and burrowing animal acorn and beechnut are invariably it most important food item in temperate zone a they are rich in the carbohydrate necessary for the buildup of fat reserve needed to survive lean period in western europe underground plant material favoured by boar includes bracken willow herb bulb meadow herb root and bulb and the bulb of cultivated crop such food is favoured in early spring and summer but may also be eaten in autumn and winter during beechnut and acorn crop failure should regular wild food become scarce boar will eat tree bark and fungi a well a visit cultivated potato and artichoke field boar soil disturbance and foraging have been shown to facilitate invasive plant boar of the vittatus subspecies in ujung kulon national park in java differ from most other population by their primarily frugivorous diet which consists of different fruit specie especially fig thus making them important seed dispersers the wild boar can consume numerous genus of poisonous plant without ill effect including aconitum anemone calla caltha ferula and pteridiumboars may occasionally prey on small vertebrate like newborn deer fawn leporid and galliform chick boar inhabiting the volga delta and near some lake and river of kazakhstan have been recorded to feed extensively on fish like carp and caspian roach boar in the former area will also feed on cormorant and heron chick bivalved mollusc trapped muskrat and mouse there is at least one record of a boar killing and eating a bonnet macaque in southern india bandipur national park though this may have been a case of intraguild predation brought on by interspecific competition for human handout predator piglet are vulnerable to attack from felid like eurasian lynx jungle cat and snow leopard and other carnivorans like brown bear and martensthe grey wolf is the main predator of wild boar throughout most of it range a single wolf can kill around to boar of differing age in one year in italy and belarus belovezhskaya pushcha national park boar are the wolf primary prey despite an abundance of alternative le powerful ungulate wolf are particularly threatening during the winter when deep snow impedes the boar movement in the baltic region heavy snowfall can allow wolf to eliminate boar from an area almost completely wolf primarily target piglet and subadults and only rarely attack adult sow adult male are usually avoided entirely dhole may also prey on boar to the point of keeping their number down in northwestern bhutan despite there being many more cattle in the area leopard are predator of wild boar in the caucasus particularly transcaucasia the russian far east india china and iran in most area boar constitute only a small part of the leopard diet however in iran sarigol national park boar are the second most frequently targeted prey specie after mouflon though adult individual are generally avoided a they are above the leopard preferred weight range of kg lb this dependence on wild boar is largely due in part to the local leopard subspecies large sizeboars of all age were once the primary prey of tiger in transcaucasia kazakhstan middle asia and the far east up until the late century in modern time tiger number are too low to have a limiting effect on boar population a single tiger can systematically destroy an entire sounder by preying on it member one by one before moving on to another sounder tiger have been noted to chase boar for longer distance than with other prey in two rare case boar were reported to gore a small tiger and a tigress to death in in the amur region wild boar are one of the two most important prey specie for tiger alongside the manchurian wapiti with the two specie collectively comprising roughly of the felid prey in sikhote alin a tiger can kill boar a year study of tiger in india indicate that boar are usually secondary in preference to various cervid and bovid though when boar are targeted healthy adult are caught more frequently than young and sick specimenson the island of komodo rinca and flores the boar main predator is the komodo dragon range reconstructed range the specie originally occurred in north africa and much of eurasia from the british isle to korea and the sunda island the northern limit of it range extended from southern scandinavia to southern siberia and japan within this range it wa only absent in extremely dry desert and alpine zone it wa once found in north africa along the nile valley up to khartum and north of the sahara the specie occurs on a few ionian and aegean island sometimes swimming between island the reconstructed northern boundary of the animal asian range ran from lake ladoga at through the area of novgorod and moscow into the southern urals where it reached from there the boundary passed ishim and farther east the irtysh at in the eastern baraba steppe near novosibirsk the boundary turned steep south encircled the altai mountain and went again eastward including the mountain and lake baikal from here the boundary went slightly north of the amur river eastward to it lower reach at the sea of okhotsk on sakhalin there are only fossil report of wild boar the southern boundary in europe and asia were almost invariably identical to the seashore of these continent it is absent in the dry region of mongolia from southward in china westward of sichuan and in india north of the himalaya it is absent in the higher elevation of the pamir and the tien shan though they do occur in the tarim basin and on the lower slope of the tien shan present range in recent century the range of wild boar ha changed dramatically largely due to hunting by human and more recently because of captive wild boar escaping into the wild prior to the century boar population had declined in numerous area with british population probably becoming extinct during the century in the warm period after the ice age wild boar lived in the southern part of sweden and norway and north of lake ladoga in karelia it wa previously thought that the specie did not live in finland during prehistory because no prehistoric wild boar bone had been found within the border of the country it wa not until when a wild boar bone wa found in askola that the specie wa found to have lived in finland more than year ago it is believed however that man prevented it establishment by hunting in denmark the last boar wa shot at the beginning of the century and by they were absent in tunisia and sudan and large area of germany austria and italy in russia they were extirpated in wide area by the the last boar in egypt reportedly died on december in the giza zoo with wild population having disappeared by prince kamal el dine hussein attempted to repopulate wadi el natrun with boar of hungarian stock but they were quickly exterminated by poachersa revival of boar population began in the middle of the century by wild boar had once again reached their original northern boundary in many part of their asiatic range by they reached leningrad and moscow and by they were to be found in archangelsk and astrakhan in the they again occurred in denmark and sweden where captive animal escaped and now survive in the wild in england wild boar population themselves in the after escaping from specialist farm that had imported european stock status in great britain wild boar were apparently already becoming rare by the century since a forestry law enacted by william the conqueror punishes through blinding the unlawful killing of a boar charles i attempted to reintroduce the specie into the new forest though this population wa exterminated during the civil war between their medieval extinction and the when wild boar farming began only a handful of captive wild boar imported from the continent were present in britain occasional escape of wild boar from wildlife park have occurred a early a the but since the early significant population have themselves after escape from farm the number of which ha increased a the demand for meat from the specie ha grown a maff now defra study on wild boar living wild in britain confirmed the presence of two population of wild boar living in britain one in sussex and another in dorset another defra report in february confirmed the existence of these two site a breeding area and identified a third in in the forest of on wye area a breeding population wa also identified in devon there is another significant population in dumfries and galloway population estimate were a follows the largest population in sussex wa then estimated at approximately animal in the core distribution area the smallest in west dorset wa estimated to be fewer than animal since winter significant have also resulted in animal colonizing area around the fringe of dartmoor in devon these are considered a an additional single breeding population and currently estimated to be up to animalspopulation estimate for the forest of dean are disputed a at the time that the defra population estimate wa a photo of a boar sounder in the forest near staunton with over animal visible wa published and at about the same time over boar were seen in a field near the original escape location of weston under penyard many kilometre or mile away in early the forestry commission embarked on a cull with the aim of reducing the boar population from an estimated animal to by august it wa stated that effort were being made to reduce the population from to but that only had been killed the failure to meet cull target wa confirmed in february boar have crossed the river wye into monmouthshire wale iolo williams the bbc wale wildlife expert attempted to film welsh boar in late many other sighting across the uk have also been reported the effect of wild boar on the uk woodland were discussed with ralph harmer of the forestry commission on the bbc radio farming today radio programme in the programme prompted activist writer george monbiot to propose a thorough population study followed by the introduction of culling introduction to north america wild boar are an invasive specie in the america and cause problem including native specie for food destroying the nest of specie killing fawn and young domestic livestock destroying agricultural crop eating tree seed and seedling destroying native vegetation and wetland through wallowing damaging water quality coming into violent conflict with human and pet and carrying pig and human disease including brucellosis trichinosis and pseudorabies in some jurisdiction it is illegal to import breed release posse sell distribute trade transport hunt or trap eurasian boar hunting and trapping is done systematically to increase the chance of eradication and to remove the incentive to illegally release boar which have mostly been spread deliberately by sport hunter history while domestic pig both captive and feral popularly termed razorback have been in north america since the earliest day of european colonization pure wild boar were not introduced into the new world until the century the suids were released into the wild by wealthy landowner a big game animal the initial introduction took place in fenced enclosure though several escape occurred with the escapee sometimes intermixing with already established feral pig population the first of these introduction occurred in new hampshire in thirteen wild boar from germany were purchased by austin corbin from carl hagenbeck and released into a game preserve in sullivan county several of these boar escaped though they were quickly hunted down by local two further introduction were made from the original stocking with several escape taking place due to breach in the game preserve fencing these escapee have ranged widely with some specimen having been observed crossing into vermontin wild boar from germany were released into a estate in hamilton county new york several specimen escaped six year later dispersing into the william c whitney wilderness area with their descendant surviving for at least yearsthe most extensive boar introduction in the u took place in western north carolina in when boar of undetermined european origin were released into two fenced enclosure in a game preserve in hooper bald graham county most of the specimen remained in the preserve for the next decade until a hunt caused the remaining animal to break through their confines and escape some of the boar migrated to tennessee where they intermixed with both and feral pig in the area in a dozen hooper bald wild pig were shipped to california and released in a property between carmel valley and the los padre national forest these hybrid boar were later used a breeding stock on various private and public land throughout the state a well a in other state like florida georgia south carolina west virginia and mississippiseveral wild boar from leon spring and the san antonio saint louis and san diego zoo were released in the powder horn ranch in calhoun county texas in these specimen escaped and established themselves in surrounding ranchlands and coastal area with some crossing the espiritu santo bay and colonizing matagorda island descendant of the powder horn ranch boar were later released onto san jose island and the coast of chalmette louisianawild boar of unknown origin were stocked in a ranch in the edward plateau in the only to escape during a storm and hybridize with local feral pig population later spreading into neighboring countiesstarting in the several boar purchased from the san diego zoo and tierpark berlin were released into the united state a decade later more specimen from farm in canada and bialowieza forest were let loose in recent year wild pig population have been reported in state within the u most of which are likely wild hog hybrid pure wild boar population may still be present but are extremely localized disease and parasite wild boar are known to host at least different parasitic worm specie with maximum infection occurring in summer young animal are vulnerable to helminth like metastrongylus which are consumed by boar through earthworm and cause death by parasitising the lung wild boar also carry parasite known to infect human including gastrodiscoides trichinella spiralis taenia solium balantidium coli and toxoplasma gondii wild boar in southern region are frequently infested with tick dermacentor rhipicephalus and hyalomma and hog louse the specie also suffers from fly which it escape by bathing frequently or hiding in dense shrubsswine plague spread very quickly in wild boar with epizootics being recorded in germany poland hungary belarus the caucasus the far east kazakhstan and other region disease can also take on epidemic proportion in boar population the specie occasionally but rarely contract pasteurellosis hemorrhagic sepsis tularemia and anthrax wild boar may on occasion contract swine erysipelas through rodent or hog louse and tick relationship with human in culture the wild boar feature prominently in the culture of people many of which saw the animal a embodying warrior virtue culture throughout europe and asia minor saw the killing of a boar a proof of one valor and strength neolithic hunter gatherer depicted relief of ferocious wild boar on their temple pillar at gobekli tepe some year ago virtually all hero in greek mythology fight or kill a boar at one point the demigod herakles third labour involves the capture of the erymanthian boar theseus slays the wild sow phaea and a disguised odysseus is recognised by his handmaiden eurycleia by the scar inflicted on him by a boar during a hunt in his youth to the mythical hyperborean the boar represented spiritual authority several greek myth use the boar a a symbol of darkness death and winter one example is the story of the youthful adonis who is killed by a boar and is permitted by zeus to depart from hades only during the spring and summer period this theme also occurs in irish and egyptian mythology where the animal is explicitly linked to the month of october therefore autumn this association likely arose from aspect of the boar actual nature it dark colour wa linked to the night while it solitary habit proclivity to consume crop and nocturnal nature were associated with evil the foundation myth of ephesus ha the city being built over the site where prince androklos of athens killed a boar boar were frequently depicted on greek funerary monument alongside lion representing gallant loser who have finally met their match a opposed to victorious hunter a lion are the theme of the doomed yet valorous boar warrior also occurred in hittite culture where it wa traditional to sacrifice a boar alongside a dog and a prisoner of war after a military defeat the boar a a warrior also appears in scandinavian germanic and culture with it image having been frequently engraved on helmet shield and sword according to tacitus the baltic aesti featured boar on their helmet and may have also worn boar mask see for example the guilden morden boar the boar and pig were held in particularly high esteem by the celt who considered them to be their most important sacred animal some celtic deity linked to boar include moccus and veteris it ha been suggested that some early myth surrounding the welsh hero culhwch involved the character being the son of a boar god nevertheless the importance of the boar a a culinary item among celtic tribe may have been exaggerated in popular culture by the asterix series a wild boar bone are rare among celtic archaeological site and the few that do occur show no sign of butchery having probably been used in sacrificial ritualsthe boar also appears in vedic mythology and hindu mythology a story present in the brahmana ha the god indra slaying an avaricious boar who ha stolen the treasure of the asura then giving it carcass to the god vishnu who offered it a a sacrifice to the god in the story retelling in the charaka samhita the boar is described a a form of prajapati and is credited with having raised the earth from the primeval water in the ramayana and the purana the same boar is portrayed a varaha an avatar of vishnu in japanese culture the boar is widely seen a a fearsome and reckless animal to the point that several word and expression in japanese referring to recklessness include reference to boar the boar is the last animal of the oriental zodiac with people born during the year of the pig being said to embody the trait of determination and impetuosity among japanese hunter the boar courage and defiance is a source of admiration and it is not uncommon for hunter and mountain people to name their son after the animal inoshishi Zhu  boar are also seen a symbol of fertility and prosperity in some region it is thought that boar are drawn to field owned by family including pregnant woman and hunter with pregnant wife are thought to have greater chance of success when boar hunting the animal link to prosperity wa illustrated by it inclusion on the note during the meiji period and it wa once believed that a man could become wealthy by keeping a clump of boar hair in his walletin the folklore of the mongol altai uriankhai tribe the wild boar wa associated with the watery underworld a it wa thought that the spirit of the dead entered the animal head to be ultimately transported to the water prior to the conversion to islam the kyrgyz people believed that they were descended from boar and thus did not eat pork in buryat mythology the forefather of the buryats descended from heaven and were nourished by a boar in china the boar is the emblem of the miao peoplethe boar sanglier is frequently displayed in english scottish and welsh heraldry a with the lion the boar is often shown a armed and langued a with the bear scottish and welsh heraldry display the boar head with the neck cropped unlike the english version which retains the neck the white boar served a the badge of king richard iii of england who distributed it among his northern retainer during his tenure a duke of gloucester a a game animal and food source human have been hunting boar for millennium the earliest artistic depiction of such activity dating back to the upper paleolithic the animal wa seen a a source of food among the ancient greek a well a a sporting challenge and source of epic narrative the roman inherited this tradition with one of it first practitioner being scipio aemilianus boar hunting became particularly popular among the young nobility during the century bc a preparation for manhood and battle a typical roman boar hunting tactic involved surrounding a given area with large net then flushing the boar with dog and immobilizing it with smaller net the animal would then be dispatched with a venabulum a short spear with a crossguard at the base of the blade more than their greek predecessor the roman extensively took inspiration from boar hunting in their art and sculpture with the ascension of constantine the great boar hunting took on christian allegorical theme with the animal being portrayed a a black beast analogous to the dragon of saint george boar hunting continued after the fall of the western roman empire though the germanic tribe considered the red deer to be a more noble and worthy quarry the nobility hunted boar a their predecessor did but primarily a training for battle rather than sport it wa not uncommon for medieval hunter to deliberately hunt boar during the breeding season when the animal were more aggressive during the renaissance when deforestation and the introduction of firearm reduced boar number boar hunting became the sole prerogative of the nobility one of many charge brought up against the rich during the german peasant war and the french revolution during the century boar were caught in the caucasus in kazakhstan and about in central asia during the soviet period primarily through the use of dog and beat in nepal farmer and poacher eliminate boar by baiting ball of wheat flour containing explosive with kerosene oil with the animal chewing motion triggering the deviceswild boar can thrive in captivity though piglet grow slowly and poorly without their mother product derived from wild boar include meat hide and bristle apicius devotes a whole chapter to the cooking of boar meat providing recipe involving roasting boiling and what sauce to use the roman usually served boar meat with garum boar head wa the centrepiece of most medieval christmas celebration among the nobility although growing in popularity a a source of food the wild boar take longer to mature than most domestic pig and it is usually smaller and produce le meat nevertheless wild boar meat is leaner and healthier than pork being of higher nutritional value and having a much higher concentration of essential amino acid most organization agree that a boar carcass should yield kg lb of meat on average large specimen can yield kg lb of fat with some giant yielding kg lb or more a boar hide can measure sq in and can yield gram oz of bristle and gram oz of underwool crop and garbage raiding boar can be damaging to agriculture in situation where their natural habitat is sparse population living on the outskirt of town or farm can dig up potato and damage melon watermelon and maize however they generally only encroach upon farm when natural food is scarce in the belovezh forest for example of the local boar population will enter field in year of moderate availability of natural food while the role of boar in damaging crop is often exaggerated case are known of boar depredation causing famine a wa the case in hachinohe japan in where people died of what became known a the wild boar famine still within japanese culture the boar status a vermin is expressed through it title a king of pest and the popular saying addressed to young men in rural area when you get married choose a place with no wild boar in central europe farmer typically repel boar through distraction or fright while in kazakhstan it is usual to employ guard dog in plantation although large boar population can play an important role in limiting forest growth they are also useful in keeping pest population such a june bug under control the growth of urban area and the corresponding decline in natural boar habitat ha led to some sounder entering human habitation in search of food a in natural condition sounder in area are matriarchal though male tend to be much le represented and adult of both sex can be up to heavier than their counterpart a of at least city in country have experienced problem of some kind relating to the presence of habituated wild boar attack on human actual attack on human are rare but can be serious resulting in penetrating injury to the lower part of the body they generally occur during the boar rutting season from november to january in agricultural area bordering forest or on path leading through forest the animal typically attack by charging and pointing it tusk towards the intended victim with most injury occurring on the thigh region once the initial attack is
