grasshopper are a group of insect belonging to the suborder caelifera they are among what is probably the most ancient living group of chewing herbivorous insect dating back to the early triassic around million year ago grasshopper are typically insect with powerful hind leg which allow them to escape from threat by leaping vigorously a hemimetabolous insect they do not undergo complete metamorphosis they hatch from an egg into a nymph or hopper which undergoes five moult becoming more similar to the adult insect at each developmental stage at high population density and under certain environmental condition some grasshopper specie can change color and behavior and form swarm under these circumstance they are known a locust grasshopper are with a few specie at time becoming serious pest of cereal vegetable and pasture especially when they swarm in their million a locust and destroy crop over wide area they protect themselves from predator by camouflage when detected many specie attempt to startle the predator with a while jumping and if adult launching themselves into the air usually flying for only a short distance other specie such a the rainbow grasshopper have warning coloration which deters predator grasshopper are affected by parasite and various disease and many predatory creature feed on both nymph and adult the egg are subject to attack by parasitoids and predator grasshopper have had a long relationship with human swarm of locust can have devastating effect and cause famine and even in smaller number the insect can be serious pest they are used a food in country such a mexico and indonesia they feature in art symbolism and literature the study of grasshopper specie is called acridology phylogeny grasshopper belong to the suborder caelifera although grasshopper is sometimes used a a common name for the suborder in general some source restrict it to the more advanced group they may be placed in the infraorder acrididea and have been a grasshopper in older text to distinguish them from the term grasshopper now or katydid with their much longer antenna the phylogeny of the caelifera based on mitochondrial ribosomal rna of taxon in six out of seven superfamily is shown a a cladogram the ensifera cricket etc caelifera and all the superfamily of grasshopper except pamphagoidea appear to be monophyletic in evolutionary term the split between the caelifera and the ensifera is no more recent than the boundary the earliest insect that are certainly caeliferans are in the extinct family locustopseidae and locustavidae from the early triassic roughly million year ago the group diversified during the triassic and have remained important from that time to now the first modern family such a the eumastacidae tetrigidae and tridactylidae appeared in the cretaceous though some insect that might belong to the last two of these group are found in the early jurassic morphological classification is difficult because many taxon have converged towards a common habitat type recent taxonomist have concentrated on the internal genitalia especially those of the male this information is not available from fossil specimen and the palaentological taxonomy is founded principally on the venation of the hindwingsthe caelifera includes some valid genus and about known specie many undescribed specie probably exist especially in tropical wet forest the caelifera have a predominantly tropical distribution with fewer specie known from temperate zone but most of the superfamily have representative worldwide they are almost exclusively herbivorous and are probably the oldest living group of chewing herbivorous insectsthe most diverse superfamily is the acridoidea with around specie the two main family in this are the acrididae grasshopper and locust with a worldwide distribution and the romaleidae lubber grasshopper found chiefly in the new world the ommexechidae and tristiridae are south american and the lentulidae lithidiidae and pamphagidae are mainly african the pauliniids are nocturnal and can swim or skate on water and the lentulids are wingless pneumoridae are native to africa particularly southern africa and are distinguished by the inflated abdomen of the male characteristic grasshopper have the typical insect body plan of head thorax and abdomen the head is held vertically at an angle to the body with the mouth at the bottom the head bear a large pair of compound eye which give vision three simple eye which can detect light and dark and a pair of antenna that are sensitive to touch and smell the mouthpart are modified for chewing and there are two sensory palps in front of the jawsthe thorax and abdomen are segmented and have a rigid cuticle made up of overlapping plate composed of chitin the three fused thoracic segment bear three pair of leg and two pair of wing the forewing known a tegmina are narrow and leathery while the hindwings are large and membranous the vein providing strength the leg are terminated by claw for gripping the hind leg is particularly powerful the femur is robust and ha several ridge where different surface join and the inner ridge bear stridulatory peg in some specie the posterior edge of the tibia bear a double row of spine and there are a pair of articulated spur near it lower end the interior of the thorax house the muscle that control the wing and leg the abdomen ha eleven segment the first of which is fused to the thorax and contains the tympanal organ and hearing system segment two to eight are and joined by flexible membrane segment nine to eleven are reduced in size segment nine bear a pair of cerci and segment ten and eleven house the reproductive organ female grasshopper are normally larger than male with short ovipositor the name of the suborder caelifera come from the latin and mean referring to the shape of the ovipositorthose specie that make easily heard noise usually do so by rubbing a row of peg on the hind leg against the edge of the forewing stridulation these sound are produced mainly by male to attract female though in some specie the female also stridulategrasshoppers may be confused with cricket but they differ in many aspect these include the number of segment in their antenna and the structure of the ovipositor a well a the location of the tympanal organ and the method by which sound is produced ensiferans have antenna that can be much longer than the body and have at least segment while caeliferans have fewer segment in their shorter stouter antenna biology diet and digestion most grasshopper are polyphagous eating vegetation from multiple plant source but some are omnivorous and also eat animal tissue and animal faeces in general their preference is for grass including many cereal grown a crop the digestive system is typical of insect with malpighian tubule discharging into the midgut carbohydrate are digested mainly in the crop while protein are digested in the cecum of the midgut saliva is abundant but largely free of enzyme helping to move food and malpighian secretion along the gut some grasshopper posse cellulase which by softening plant cell wall make plant cell content accessible to other digestive enzyme sensory organ grasshopper have a typical insect nervous system and have an extensive set of external sense organ on the side of the head are a pair of large compound eye which give a broad field of vision and can detect movement shape colour and distance there are also three simple eye ocellus on the forehead which can detect light intensity a pair of antenna containing olfactory smell and touch receptor and mouthpart containing gustatory taste receptor at the front end of the abdomen there is a pair of tympanal organ for sound reception there are numerous fine hair seta covering the whole body that act a mechanoreceptors touch and wind sensor and these are most dense on the antenna the palps part of the mouth and on the cerci at the tip of the abdomen there are special receptor campaniform sensillae embedded in the cuticle of the leg that sense pressure and cuticle distortion there are internal chordotonal sense organ specialized to detect position and movement about the joint of the exoskeleton the receptor convey information to the central nervous system through sensory neuron and most of these have their cell body located in the periphery near the receptor site itself circulation and respiration like other insect grasshopper have an open circulatory system and their body cavity are filled with haemolymph a structure in the upper part of the abdomen pump the fluid to the head from where it percolate past the tissue and organ on it way back to the abdomen this system circulates nutrient throughout the body and carry metabolic waste to be excreted into the gut other function of the haemolymph include wound healing heat transfer and the provision of hydrostatic pressure but the circulatory system is not involved in gaseous exchange respiration is performed using trachea tube which open at the surface of the thorax and abdomen through pair of valved spiracle larger insect may need to actively ventilate their body by opening some spiracle while others remain closed using abdominal muscle to expand and contract the body and pump air through the system jumping a large grasshopper such a a locust can jump about a metre twenty body length without using it wing the acceleration peak at about g grasshopper jump by extending their large back leg and pushing against the substrate the ground a twig a blade of grass or whatever else they are standing on the reaction force propels them into the air they jump for several reason to escape from a predator to launch themselves into flight or simply to move from place to place for the escape jump in particular there is strong selective pressure to maximize velocity since this determines the range this mean that the leg must thrust against the ground with both high force and a high velocity of movement a fundamental property of muscle is that it can not contract with high force and high velocity at the same time grasshopper overcome this by using a catapult mechanism to amplify the mechanical power produced by their musclesthe jump is a process first the grasshopper fully flex the lower part of the leg tibia against the upper part femur by activating the flexor tibia muscle the back leg of the grasshopper in the top photograph are in this preparatory position second there is a period of in which force build up in the large pennate extensor tibia muscle but the tibia is kept flexed by the simultaneous contraction of the flexor tibia muscle the extensor muscle is much stronger than the flexor muscle but the latter is aided by specialisation in the joint that give it a large effective mechanical advantage over the former when the tibia is fully flexed can last for up to half a second and during this period the extensor muscle shortens and store elastic strain energy by distorting stiff cuticular structure in the leg the extensor muscle contraction is quite slow almost isometric which allows it to develop high force up to n in the desert locust but because it is slow only low power is needed the third stage of the jump is the trigger relaxation of the flexor muscle which release the tibia from the flexed position the subsequent rapid tibial extension is driven mainly by the relaxation of the elastic structure rather than by further shortening of the extensor muscle in this way the stiff cuticle act like the elastic of a catapult or the bow of a energy is put into the store at low power by slow but strong muscle contraction and retrieved from the store at high power by rapid relaxation of the mechanical elastic structure stridulation male grasshopper spend much of the day stridulating singing more actively under optimal condition and being more subdued when condition are adverse female also stridulate but their effort are insignificant when compared to the male male nymph can sometimes be seen making stridulatory movement although they lack the equipment to make sound demonstrating the importance of this behavioural trait the song are a mean of communication the male stridulation seems to express reproductive maturity the desire for social cohesion and individual social cohesion becomes necessary among grasshopper because of their ability to jump or fly large distance and the song can serve to limit dispersal and guide others to favourable habitat the generalised song can vary in phraseology and intensity and is modified in the presence of a rival male and change again to a courtship song when a female is nearby in male grasshopper of the family pneumoridae the enlarged abdomen amplifies stridulation life cycle in most grasshopper specie conflict between male over female rarely escalate beyond ritualistic display some exception include the chameleon grasshopper kosciuscola tristis where male may fight on top of ovipositing female engaging in leg grappling biting kicking and mountingthe newly emerged female grasshopper ha a preoviposition period of a week or two while she increase in weight and her egg mature after mating the female of most specie dig a hole with her ovipositor and lay a batch of egg in a pod in the ground near food plant generally in the summer after laying the egg she cover the hole with soil and litter some like the cornops aquaticum deposit the pod directly into plant tissue the egg in the pod are glued together with a froth in some specie after a few week of development the egg of most specie in temperate climate go into diapause and pas the winter in this state diapause is broken by a sufficiently low ground temperature with development resuming a soon a the ground warms above a certain threshold temperature the embryo in a pod generally all hatch out within a few minute of each other they soon shed their membrane and their exoskeleton harden these first instar nymph can then jump away from predatorsgrasshoppers undergo incomplete metamorphosis they repeatedly moult each instar becoming larger and more like an adult with the increasing in size at each stage the number of instar varies between specie but is often six after the final moult the wing are inflated and become fully functional the migratory grasshopper melanoplus sanguinipes spends about to day a a nymph depending on sex and temperature and life for about day a an adult swarming locust are the swarming phase of certain specie of grasshopper in the family acrididae swarming behaviour is a response to overcrowding increased tactile stimulation of the hind leg cause an increase in level of serotonin this cause the grasshopper to change colour feed more and breed faster the transformation of a solitary individual into a swarming one is induced by several contact per minute over a short periodfollowing this transformation under suitable condition dense nomadic band of flightless nymph known a hopper can occur producing pheromone which attract the insect to each other with several generation in a year the locust population can build up from localised group into vast accumulation of flying insect known a plague devouring all the vegetation they encounter the largest recorded locust swarm wa one formed by the rocky mountain locust in the swarm wa mile km long and mile km wide and one estimate put the number of locust involved at trillion an adult desert locust can eat about g oz of plant material each day so the billion of insect in a large swarm can be very destructive stripping all the foliage from plant in an affected area and consuming stem flower fruit seed and bark predator parasite and pathogen grasshopper have a wide range of predator at different stage of their life egg are eaten by ground beetle and blister beetle hopper and adult are taken by other insect such a ant robber fly and sphecid wasp by spider and by many bird and small mammal including dog and catsthe egg and nymph are under attack by parasitoids including blow fly flesh fly and tachinid fly external parasite of adult and nymph include mite female grasshopper parasitised by mite produce fewer egg and thus have fewer offspring than unaffected individual the grasshopper nematode mermis nigrescens is a long slender worm that infects grasshopper living in the insect hemocoel adult worm lay egg on plant and the host becomes infected when the foliage is eaten spinochordodes tellinii and paragordius tricuspidatus are parasitic worm that infect grasshopper and alter the behaviour of their host when the worm are sufficiently developed the grasshopper is persuaded to leap into a nearby body of water where it drowns thus enabling the parasite to continue with the next stage of it life cycle which take place in water grasshopper are affected by disease caused by bacteria virus fungi and protozoa the bacteria serratia marcescens and pseudomonas aeruginosa have both been implicated in causing disease in grasshopper a ha the entomopathogenic fungus beauveria bassiana this widespread fungus ha been used to control various pest insect around the world but although it infects grasshopper the infection is not usually lethal because basking in the sun ha the result of raising the insect temperature above a threshold tolerated by the fungus the fungal pathogen entomophaga grylli is able to influence the behaviour of it grasshopper host causing it to climb to the top of a plant and cling to the stem a it dy this ensures wide dispersal of the fungal spore liberated from the corpsethe fungal pathogen metarhizium acridum is found in africa australia and brazil where it ha caused epizootics in grasshopper it is being investigated for possible use a a microbial insecticide for locust control the microsporidian fungus nosema locustae once considered to be a protozoan can be lethal to grasshopper it ha to be consumed by mouth and is the basis for a commercial microbial pesticide various other microsporidian and protozoan are found in the gut defence grasshopper exemplify a range of adaptation enabling them to avoid detection to escape if detected and in some case to avoid being eaten if captured grasshopper are often camouflaged to avoid detection by predator that hunt by sight some specie can change their coloration to suit their surroundingsseveral specie such a the hooded leaf grasshopper phyllochoreia ramakrishnai eumastacoidea are detailed mimic of leaf stick grasshopper proscopiidae mimic wooden stick in form and coloration grasshopper often have deimatic pattern on their wing giving a sudden flash of bright colour that may startle predator long enough to give time to escape in a combination of jump and flightsome specie are genuinely aposematic having both bright warning coloration and sufficient toxicity to dissuade predator dictyophorus productus pyrgomorphidae is a heavy bloated sluggish insect that make no attempt to hide it ha a bright red abdomen a cercopithecus monkey that ate other grasshopper refused to eat the specie another specie the rainbow or painted grasshopper of arizona dactylotum bicolor acridoidea ha been shown by experiment with a natural predator the little striped whiptail lizard to be aposematic relationship with human in art and medium grasshopper are occasionally depicted in artwork such a the dutch golden age painter balthasar van der ast still life oil painting flower in a vase with shell and insect c now in the national gallery london though the insect may be a orthopteran is found in rachel ruysch still life flower in a vase c the seemingly static scene is animated by a grasshopper on the table that look about ready to spring according to the gallery curator betsy wieseman with other invertebrate including a spider an ant and two caterpillarsgrasshoppers are also featured in cinema the film beginning of the end portrayed giant grasshopper attacking chicago in the animated film a bug life the antagonist are a gang of grasshopper with their leader hopper serving a the main villain symbolism grasshopper are sometimes used a symbol during the greek archaic era the grasshopper wa the symbol of the polis of athens possibly because they were among the most common insect on the dry plain of attica native athenian for a while wore golden grasshopper brooch to symbolise that they were of pure athenian lineage with no foreign ancestor another symbolic use of the grasshopper is sir thomas gresham gilded grasshopper in lombard street london dating from the building wa for a while the headquarters of the guardian royal exchange but the company declined to use the symbol for fear of confusion with the locustwhen grasshopper appear in dream these have been interpreted a symbol of freedom independence spiritual enlightenment inability to settle down or commit to decision locust are taken literally to mean devastation of crop in the case of farmer figuratively a wicked men and woman for and extravagance misfortune ephemeral happiness by gypsy a food in some country grasshopper are used a food in southern mexico grasshopper known a chapulines are eaten in a variety of dish such a in tortilla with chilli sauce grasshopper are served on skewer in some chinese food market like the donghuamen night market fried grasshopper walang goreng are eaten in the gunung kidul regency yogyakarta java in indonesia in america the ohlone burned grassland to herd grasshopper into pit where they could be collected a foodit is recorded in the bible that john the baptist ate locust and wild honey greek akrides kai meli agrion akrides kai meli agrion while living in the wilderness however because of a tradition of depicting him a an ascetic attempt have been made to explain that the locust were in fact a suitably ascetic vegetarian food such a carob bean notwithstanding the fact that the word akrides mean plainly grasshoppersin recent year with the search for alternative healthy and sustainable protein source grasshopper are being cultivated by commercial company operating grasshopper farm and are being used a food and protein supplement a pest grasshopper eat large quantity of foliage both a adult and during their development and can be serious pest of arid land and prairie pasture grain forage vegetable and other crop can be affected grasshopper often bask in the sun and thrive in warm sunny condition so drought stimulates an increase in grasshopper population a single season of drought is not normally sufficient to stimulate a major population increase but several successive dry season can do so especially if the intervening winter are mild so that large number of nymph survive although sunny weather stimulates growth there need to be an adequate food supply for the increasing grasshopper population this mean that although precipitation is needed to stimulate plant growth prolonged period of cloudy weather will slow nymphal developmentgrasshoppers can best be prevented from becoming pest by manipulating their environment shade provided by tree will discourage them and they may be prevented from moving onto developing crop by removing coarse vegetation from fallow land and field margin and discouraging thick growth beside ditch and on roadside verge with increasing number of grasshopper predator number may increase but this seldom happens rapidly enough to have much effect on population biological control is being investigated and spore of the protozoan parasite nosema locustae can be used mixed with bait to control grasshopper being more effective with immature insect on a small scale neem product can be effective a a feeding deterrent and a a disruptor of nymphal development insecticide can be used but adult grasshopper are difficult to kill and a they move into field from surrounding rank growth crop may soon become reinfestedsome grasshopper specie like the chinese rice grasshopper are a pest in rice paddy ploughing expose the egg on the surface of the field to be destroyed by sunshine or eaten by natural enemy some egg may be buried too deeply in the soil for hatching to take placelocust plague can have devastating effect on human population causing famine and population upheaval they are mentioned in both the koran and the bible and have also been held responsible for cholera epidemic resulting from the corps of locust drowned in the mediterranean sea and decomposing on beach the fao and other organisation monitor locust activity around the world timely application of pesticide can prevent nomadic band of hopper from forming before dense swarm of adult can build up besides conventional control using contact insecticide biological pest control using the entomopathogenic fungus metarhizium acridum which specifically infects grasshopper ha been used with some success explosive detection in february researcher from washington university in st louis announced they had engineered cyborg grasshopper capable of accurately detecting explosive in the project funded by the u office of naval research researcher fitted grasshopper with lightweight sensor backpack that recorded and transmitted the electrical activity of their antennal lobe to a computer according to the researcher the grasshopper were able to detect the location of the highest concentration of explosive the researcher also tested the effect of combining sensorial information from several grasshopper on detection accuracy the neural activity from seven grasshopper yielded an average detection accuracy rate of whereas a single grasshopper yielded a rate in literature the egyptian word for locust or grasshopper wa written snhm in the consonantal hieroglyphic writing system the pharaoh ramesses ii compared the army of the hittite to locust they covered the mountain and valley and were like locust in their multitude one of aesop fable later retold by la fontaine is the tale of the ant and the grasshopper the ant work hard all summer while the grasshopper play in winter the ant is ready but the grasshopper starves somerset maugham short story the ant and the grasshopper explores the fable symbolism via complex framing other human weakness besides improvidence have become identified with the grasshopper behaviour so an unfaithful woman hopping from man to man is a grasshopper in poprygunya an short story by anton chekhov and in jerry paris film the grasshopper in mechanical engineering the name grasshopper wa given to the aeronca and piper light aircraft both used for reconnaissance and other support duty in world war ii the name is said to have originated when major general innis p swift saw a piper making a rough landing and remarked that it looked like a damned grasshopper for it bouncing
