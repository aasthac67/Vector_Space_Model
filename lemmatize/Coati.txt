coati also known a coatimundis are member of the family procyonidae in the genus nasua and nasuella they are diurnal mammal native to south america central america mexico and the southwestern united state the name coatimundi purportedly derives from the tupian language of brazilthe coati is also known in english a the coon physical characteristic adult coati measure to cm to in from head to the base of the tail which can be a long a their body coati are about cm in tall at the shoulder and weigh between and kg and lb about the size of a large house cat male can become almost twice a large a female and have large sharp canine teeth the above measurement are for the and south america coati the two mountain coati are smallerall coati share a slender head with an elongated flexible slightly nose small ear dark foot and a long tail used for balance and signaling coati have either a light brown or black coat with a lighter and a tail in most case coati have a long brown tail with ring on it which are anywhere from starkly defined like a raccoon to very faint like raccoon and unlike cat and cacomistle the ring go completely around the tail coati often hold the tail erect it is used a such to keep troop of coati together in tall vegetation the tip of the tail can be moved slightly on it own a is the case with cat but it is not prehensile a is that of the kinkajou another procyonid coati have and paw and walk plantigrade on the sol of the foot a do human like raccoon and bear coati have nonretractable claw coati also are in common with raccoon and other procyonid and others in the order carnivora and rare case amongst other mammal able to rotate their ankle beyond they are therefore able to descend tree head first other animal living in forest have acquired some or all of these property through convergent evolution including member of the mongoose civet weasel cat and bear family the coati snout is long and somewhat see suidae part of the reason for it nickname raccoon it is also extremely flexible it can be rotated up to in any direction they use their nose to push object and rub part of their body the facial marking include white marking around the eye and on the ear and snout coati have strong limb to climb and dig and have a reputation for intelligence like their fellow procyonid the raccoon they prefer to sleep or rest in elevated place and niche like the rainforest canopy in crudely built sleeping nest coati are active day and night habitat and range overall coati are widespread occupying habitat ranging from hot and arid area to humid amazonian rainforest or even cold andean mountain slope including grassland and bushy area their geographical range extends from the southwestern u southern arizona new mexico and texas through northern uruguay around ten coati are thought to have formed a breeding population in cumbria uk taxonomy the following specie are recognized genus nasua nasua narica linnaeus coati southwestern united state mexico central america and colombia nasua nasua linnaeus south american coati south america genus nasuella nasuella meridensis thomas eastern mountain coati venezuela nasuella olivacea gray western mountain coati colombia and ecuador the cozumel island coati wa formerly recognized a a specie but the vast majority of recent authority treat it a a subspecies n narica nelsoni of the coatigenetic evidence cytochrome b sequence ha suggested that the genus nasuella should be merged into nasua a the latter is otherwise paraphyletic other genetic study have shown that the closest relative of the coati are the olingos genus bassaricyon the two lineage are thought to have diverged about million year ago lifespan in the wild coati live for about seven year while in captivity they can live for up to or year feeding habit coati are omnivore their diet consists mainly of ground litter invertebrate such a tarantula and fruit et al hirsch they also eat small vertebrate prey such a lizard rodent small bird bird egg and crocodile egg the snout with an acute sense of smell assist the paw in a manner to unearth invertebrate behavior little is known about the behavior of the mountain coati and the following is almost entirely about the coati of the genus nasua unlike most member of the raccoon family procyonidae coati are primarily diurnal nasua coati female and young male up to two year of age are gregarious and travel through their territory in noisy loosely organized band made up of four to individual foraging with their offspring on the ground or in the forest canopy male over two year become solitary due to behavioural disposition and collective aggression from the female and will join the female group only during the breeding season when provoked or for defense coati can be fierce fighter their strong jaw sharp canine teeth and fast scratching paw along with a tough hide sturdily attached to the underlying muscle make it very difficult for potential predator eg dog or jaguar to seize the smaller mammal coati communicate their intention or mood with chirping snorting or grunting sound different chirping sound are used to express joy during social grooming appeasement after fight or to convey irritation or anger snorting while digging along with an erect tail state territorial or food claim during foraging coati additionally use special posture or move to convey simple message for example hiding the nose between the front paw a a sign for submission lowering the head baring teeth and jumping at an enemy signal an aggressive disposition individual recognize other coati by their look voice and smell the individual smell is intensified by special on their neck and belly coati from panama are known to rub their own fur and that of other troop member with resin from trattinnickia aspera burseraceae tree but it purpose is unclear some proposed possibility are it serf a an insect repellent a fungicide or a a form of reproduction coati breeding season mainly corresponds with the start of the rainy season to coincide with maximum availability of food especially fruit between january and march in some area and between october and february in others during the breeding season an adult male is accepted into the band of female and juvenile near the beginning of the breeding season leading to a polygynous mating system the pregnant female separate from the group build a nest on a tree or in a rocky niche and after a gestation period of about week give birth to litter of three to seven kit about six week after birth the female and their young will rejoin the band female become sexually mature at two year of age while male will acquire sexual maturity at three year of age natural predator coati predator include jaguarundi anaconda maned wolf boa constrictor fox dog tayra ocelot and jaguar large raptor such a ornate eagle and harpy eagle also are known to hunt them capuchin monkey hunt their pup status coati face unregulated hunting and the serious threat of environmental destruction in central and south america the absence of scientifically sound population study of nasua or nasuella in the wild is probably leading to a severe underestimation of the ecological problem and decline in number affecting the specie in captivity coati are one of five group of procyonid commonly kept a pet in various part of north central and south america the others being the raccoon common and the kinkajou the cat and cacomistle however while both the and south america coati are common in captivity mountain coati are extremely rare in captivitycoatis are small creature that can be wild somewhat difficult to control or train in some case and generally behave in a manner radically different from that of a pet dog optimally they should have a spacious outdoor enclosure and a room in the house other place a well they can be given the run of the house but need careful watching more careful in some case than others it is possible to litter or toilet train coati if one can not be trained a such it is still possible to lessen problem in that they tend to designate a latrine area which can have a litter pan placed in it a is done with many ferret pet skunk rabbit and rodent coati generally need both dog and cat vaccine for distemper and many other disease and a killed rabies vaccine they can be spayed or neutered for the same reason a cat and dog and other pet gallery reference external link medium related to nasua at wikimedia common the dictionary definition of coati at wiktionary
