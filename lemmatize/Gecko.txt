gecko are small lizard belonging to the infraorder gekkota found in warm climate throughout the world they range from to cm to inch most gecko can not blink but they often lick their eye to keep them clean and moist they have a fixed lens within each iris that enlarges in darkness to let in more light gecko are unique among lizard for their vocalization which differs from specie to specie most gecko in the family gekkonidae use chirping or clicking sound in their social interaction tokay gecko gekko gecko are known for their loud mating call and some other specie are capable of making hissing noise when alarmed or threatened they are the most group of lizard with about different specie worldwide the new latin gekko and english gecko stem from the gekoq which is imitative of sound that some specie makeall gecko except specie in the family eublepharidae lack eyelid instead the outer surface of the eyeball ha a transparent membrane the cornea specie without eyelid generally lick their own cornea when they need to clear them of dust and dirtnocturnal specie have excellent night vision their color vision in low light is time more sensitive than human color vision the nocturnal gecko evolved from diurnal specie which had lost the eye rod the gecko eye therefore modified it cone that increased in size into different type both single and double three different photopigment have been retained and are sensitive to uv blue and green they also use a multifocal optical system that allows them to generate a sharp image for at least two different depth while most gecko specie are nocturnal some specie are diurnal and active during the day which ha evolved multiple time independently like most lizard gecko can lose their tail in defense a process called autotomy many specie are well known for their specialised toe pad that enable them to climb smooth and vertical surface and even cross indoor ceiling with ease gecko are well known to people who live in warm region of the world where several specie make their home inside human habitation these for example the house gecko become part of the indoor menagerie and are often welcomed a they feed on insect including moth and mosquito unlike most lizard gecko are usually nocturnalthe largest specie the kawekaweau is only known from a single stuffed specimen found in the basement of a museum in marseille france this gecko wa cm in long and it wa likely endemic to new zealand where it lived in native forest it wa probably wiped out along with much of the native fauna of these island in the late century when new invasive specie such a rat and stoat were introduced to the country during european colonization the smallest gecko the jaragua sphaero is a mere cm about half an inch long and wa discovered in on a small island off the coast of the dominican republic common trait like other reptile gecko are ectothermic producing very little metabolic heat essentially a gecko body temperature is dependent on it environment also to accomplish their main a locomotion feeding reproduction must have a relatively elevated temperature shedding or molting all gecko shed their skin at fairly regular interval with specie differing in timing and method leopard gecko shed at about to interval the presence of moisture aid in the shedding when shedding begin the gecko speed the process by detaching the loose skin from it body and eating it for young gecko shedding occurs more frequently once a week but when they are fully grown they shed once every one to two month adhesion ability about of gecko specie have adhesive toe pad that allow them to adhere to most surface without the use of liquid or surface tension such pad have been gained and lost repeatedly over the course of gecko evolution adhesive toepads evolved independently in about different gecko lineage and were lost in at least lineagesthe seta arranged in lamella on gecko footpad enable attractive van der waals force the weakest of the weak chemical force between the structure and the surface these van der waals interaction involve no fluid in theory a boot made of synthetic seta would adhere a easily to the surface of the international space station a it would to a wall although adhesion varies with humiditya recent study suggests that gecko adhesion is in fact mainly determined by electrostatic interaction caused by contact electrification not van der waals or capillary forcesthe seta on the foot of gecko are also and usually remove any clogging dirt within a few stepsteflon which ha very low surface energy is more difficult for gecko to adhere to than many other surface gecko adhesion is typically improved by higher humidity even on hydrophobic surface yet is reduced under condition of complete immersion in water the role of water in that system is under discussion yet recent experiment agree that the presence of molecular water layer water molecule carry a very large dipole moment on the seta a well a on the surface increase the surface energy of both therefore the energy gain in getting these surface in contact is enlarged which result in an increased gecko adhesion force moreover the elastic property of the change with water uptakegecko toe seem to be double jointed but this is a misnomer and is properly called digital hyperextension gecko toe can hyperextend in the opposite direction from human finger and toe this allows them to overcome the van der waals force by peeling their toe off surface from the tip inward in essence by this peeling action the gecko separate spatula by spatula from the surface so for each spatula separation only some force necessary the process is similar to removing scotch tape from a surface gecko toe operate well below their full attractive capability most of the time because the margin for error is great depending upon the surface roughness and therefore the number of seta in contact with that surface use of small van der waals force requires very large surface area every square millimeter of a gecko footpad contains about seta each seta ha a diameter of mm human hair varies from to mm so the area of a human hair is equivalent to to seta each seta is in turn tipped with between and spatulae each spatula is mm long one of a meter or just below the wavelength of visible lightthe seta of a typical mature g oz gecko would be capable of supporting a weight of kg lb each spatula can exert an adhesive force of to nn the exact value of the adhesion force of a spatula varies with the surface energy of the substrate to which it adheres recent study have moreover shown that the component of the surface energy derived from force such a van der waals force depends on the material structure below the outermost atomic layer up to nm beneath the surface taking that into account the adhesive strength can be inferred apart from the seta substance produced naturally in their come into play these lipid lubricate the seta and allow the gecko to detach it foot before the next step the origin of gecko adhesion likely started a simple modification to the epidermis on the underside of the toe this wa recently discovered in the genus gonatodes from south america simple elaboration of the epidermal spinules into seta have enabled gonatodes humeralis to climb smooth surface and sleep on smooth leaf biomimetic technology designed to mimic gecko adhesion could produce reusable dry adhesive with many application development effort is being put into these technology but manufacturing synthetic seta is not a trivial material design task skin gecko skin doe not generally bear scale but appears at a macro scale a a papillose surface which is made from protuberance developed across the entire body these confer superhydrophobicity and the unique design of the hair confers a profound antimicrobial action these protuberance are very small up to micron in length and tapering to a point gecko skin ha been observed to have an property killing bacteria when it come in contact with the skin teeth gecko are polyphyodonts and able to replace each of their teeth every to month next to the full grown tooth there is a small replacement tooth developing from the odontogenic stem cell in the dental lamina the formation of the teeth is pleurodont they are fused ankylosed by their side to the inner surface of the jaw bone this formation is common in all specie in the order squamata taxonomy and classification the infraorder gekkota is divided into seven family containing about genus of gecko including the legless pygopods family carphodactylidae family diplodactylidae family eublepharidae family gekkonidae family phyllodactylidae family pygopodidae family sphaerodactylidae specie more than specie of gecko
