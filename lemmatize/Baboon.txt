baboon are primate comprising the genus papio one of the genus of old world monkey there are five specie of baboon commonly known a hamadryas baboon guinea baboon olive baboon yellow baboon and chacma baboon each specie is native to one of five area of africa and the hamadryas baboon is also native to part of the arabian peninsula baboon are among the largest primate and have existed for at least two million year baboon vary in size and weight depending on the specie the smallest the kinda baboon is cm in in length and weighs only kg lb while the largest the chacma baboon is up to cm in in length and weighs kg lb all baboon have long muzzle heavy powerful jaw with sharp canine teeth eye thick fur except on their muzzle short tail and nerveless hairless pad of skin on their protruding buttock called ischial callosity that provide for sitting comfort male hamadryas baboon have large white mane baboon exhibit sexual dimorphism in size colour canine teeth development baboon have diurnality and are terrestrial but sleep in tree or on high cliff or rock at night away from predator they are found in open savannah and woodland across africa they are omnivorous common source of food are grass seed root leaf bark various fruit insect fish shellfish rodent bird vervet monkey and small antelope their principal predator are nile crocodile leopard lion and hyena most baboon live in hierarchical troop containing harem baboon can determine from vocal exchange what the dominance relation are between individual in general each male can mate with any female the mating order among the male depends partly on their social rank female typically give birth after a gestation usually to one infant the female tend to be the primary caretaker of the young although several female may share the duty for all of their offspring offspring are weaned after about a year they reach sexual maturity around five to eight year male leave their birth group usually before they reach sexual maturity whereas most female stay in the same group for their life baboon in captivity live up to year while in the wild they average between to year taxonomy five specie of papio are commonly recognized although there is some disagreement about whether they are really full specie or subspecies they are p ursinus chacma baboon found in southern africa p papio western red or guinea baboon found in the far western africa p hamadryas hamadryas baboon found in the horn of africa and southwestern arabia p anubis olive baboon found in the african savanna and p cynocephalus yellow baboon found in and eastern africa the five specie of baboon in the genus papio are hamadryas baboon papio hamadryas guinea baboon papio papio olive baboon papio anubis yellow baboon papio cynocephalus central yellow baboon papio cynocephalus cynocephalus ibean baboon papio cynocephalus ibeanus kinda baboon papio cynocephalus kindae chacma baboon papio ursinus cape chacma papio ursinus ursinus chacma papio ursinus griseipes ruacana chacma papio ursinus raucanamany author distinguish p hamadryas a a full specie but regard all the others a subspecies of p cynocephalus and refer to them collectively a savanna baboon this may not be helpful it is based on the argument that the hamadryas baboon is behaviorally and physically distinct from other baboon specie and that this reflects a separate evolutionary history however recent morphological and genetic study of papio show the hamadryas baboon to be more closely related to the northern baboon specie the guinea and olive baboon than to the southern specie the yellow and chacma baboon the traditional classification probably the variation within papio some commentator argue that at least two more form should be recognized including the tiny kinda baboon p cynocephalus kindae from zambia dr congo and angola and the baboon p ursinus griseipes found in zambia botswana zimbabwe mozambique and northern south africa however current knowledge of the morphological genetic and behavioral diversity within papio is too poor to make any final comprehensive judgment on this matter phylogeny in researcher found the oldest baboon fossil dating million year ago characteristic all baboon have long muzzle heavy powerful jaw with sharp canine teeth eye thick fur except on their muzzle short tail and rough spot on their protruding buttock called ischial callosity these callus are nerveless hairless pad of skin that provide for the sitting comfort of the baboon all baboon specie exhibit pronounced sexual dimorphism usually in size but also sometimes in colour or canine development male of the hamadryas baboon specie also have large white mane behavior and ecology baboon are able to acquire orthographic processing skill which form part of the ability to read habitat and prey baboon are terrestrial ground dwelling and are found in open savannah open woodland and hill across africa their diet are omnivorous they eat grass root seed leaf fruit insect fish shellfish rodent bird vervet monkey and small antelope they are forager and are active at irregular time throughout the day and night they often raid human dwelling and in south africa they have been known to prey on sheep goat and poultry predator their principal predator are nile crocodile lion spotted and striped hyena leopard and cheetah they are considered a difficult prey for the leopard though which is mostly a threat to young baboon large male will often confront them by flashing their eyelid showing their teeth by yawning making gesture and chasing after the although they are not a prey specie baboon have been killed by the black mamba snake this usually occurs when a baboon accidentally rous the snake social system the collective noun for baboon is troop most baboon live in hierarchical troop group size are typically around animal but can vary between and depending on specie location and time of year the structure within the troop varies considerably between hamadryas baboon and the remaining specie sometimes collectively referred to a savanna baboon the hamadryas baboon often appear in very large group composed of many smaller harem one male with four or so female to which female from elsewhere in the troop are recruited while they are still too young to breed other baboon specie have a more promiscuous structure with a strict dominance hierarchy based on the matriline the hamadryas baboon group will typically include a younger male but he will not attempt to mate with the female unless the older male is removed in the harem of the hamadryas baboon the male jealously guard their female to the point of grabbing and biting the female when they wander too far away despite this some male will raid harem for female such situation often cause aggressive fight between the male visual threat usually accompany these aggressive fight these include a quick flashing of the eyelid accompanied by a yawn to show off the teeth some male succeed in taking a female from another harem called a takeover in several specie infant baboon are taken by the male a hostage or used a shield during fight baboon can determine from vocal exchange what the dominance relation are between individual when a confrontation occurs between different family or where a baboon take the offensive baboon show more interest in this exchange than those between member of the same family or when a baboon take the offensive this is because confrontation between different family or rank challenge can have a wider impact on the whole troop than an internal conflict in a family or a baboon reinforcing it dominancebaboon social dynamic can also vary robert sapolsky reported on a troop known a the forest troop during the which experienced significantly le aggressive social dynamic after it most aggressive male died off during a tuberculosis outbreak leaving a skewed gender ration of majority female and a minority of male this relatively culture persisted into the and extended to new male coming into the troop though sapolsky observed that while unique the troop wa a not an unrecognizably different utopia there wa still a dominance hierarchy and aggressive intrasexual competition amongst male furthermore no new behaviour were created amongst the baboon rather the difference wa the frequency and context of existing baboon behaviour mating baboon mating behavior varies greatly depending on the social structure of the troop in the mixed group of savanna baboon each male can mate with any female the mating order among the male depends partially on their social ranking and fight between male are not unusual there are however more subtle possibility in mixed group male sometimes try to win the friendship of female to garner this friendship they may help groom the female help care for her young or supply her with food the probability is high that those young are their offspring some female clearly prefer such friendly male a mate however male will also take infant during fight to protect themselves from harm a female initiate mating by presenting her swollen rump to the male face birth rearing young and life expectancy female typically give birth after a gestation usually to a single infant twin baboon are rare and often do not survive the young baboon weighs approximately g and ha a black epidermis when born the female tend to be the primary caretaker of the young although several female will share the duty for all of their offspring after about one year the young animal are weaned they reach sexual maturity in five to eight year baboon male leave their birth group usually before they reach sexual maturity whereas female are philopatric and stay in the same group their whole life baboon in captivity have been known to live up to year while in the wild their life expectancy is between to year relationship with human in egyptian mythology babi wa the deification of the
