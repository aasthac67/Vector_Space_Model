the domestic goat or simply goat capra aegagrus hircus is a subspecies of c aegagrus domesticated from the wild goat of southwest asia and eastern europe the goat is a member of the animal family bovidae and the subfamily caprinae meaning it is closely related to the sheep there are over distinct breed of goat goat are one of the oldest domesticated specie of animal and have been used for milk meat fur and skin across much of the world milk from goat is often turned into goat cheese female goat are referred to a doe or nanny intact male are called buck or billy and juvenile goat of both sex are called kid castrated male are called wether while the word hircine and caprine both refer to anything having a quality hircine is used most often to emphasize the distinct smell of domestic goat in there were more than million goat living in the world according to the un food and agriculture organization etymology the modern english word goat come from old english gat goat in general which in turn derives from gaitaz cf geit german geiss and gothic gait ultimately from ghaidos meaning young goat cf latin haedus kid itself perhaps from a root meaning jump assuming that old church slavonic zajeci hare sanskrit jihite he move are related to refer to the male old english used bucca giving modern buck until ousted by hegote hegoote in the late century nanny goat female originated in the century and billy goat for male in the history goat are among the earliest animal domesticated by human the most recent genetic analysis confirms the archaeological evidence that the wild bezoar ibex of the zagros mountain is the likely original ancestor of probably all domestic goat todayneolithic farmer began to herd wild goat primarily for easy access to milk and meat a well a to their dung which wa used a fuel and their bone hair and sinew for clothing building and tool the earliest remnant of domesticated goat dating year before present are found in ganj dareh in iran goat remains have been found at archaeological site in jericho choga mami djeitun and cayonu dating the domestication of goat in western asia at between and year agostudies of dna evidence suggests year bp a the domestication datehistorically goat hide ha been used for water and wine bottle in both traveling and transporting wine for sale it ha also been used to produce parchment anatomy and health each recognized breed of goat ha specific weight range which vary from over kg lb for buck of larger breed such a the boer to to kg to lb for smaller goat doe within each breed different strain or bloodline may have different recognized size at the bottom of the size range are miniature breed such a the african pygmy which stand to cm to in at the shoulder a adult horn most goat naturally have two horn of various shape and size depending on the breed there have been incident of polycerate goat having a many a eight horn although this is a genetic rarity thought to be inherited unlike cattle goat have not been successfully bred to be reliably polled a the gene determining sex and those determining horn are closely linked breeding together two genetically polled goat result in a high number of intersex individual among the offspring which are typically sterile their horn are made of living bone surrounded by keratin and other protein and are used for defense dominance and territoriality digestion and lactation goat are ruminant they have a stomach consisting of the rumen the reticulum the omasum and the abomasum a with other mammal ruminant they are ungulate the female have an udder consisting of two teat in contrast to cattle which have four teat an exception to this is the boer goat which sometimes may have up to eight teat eye goat have horizontal pupil because goat iris are usually pale their contrasting pupil are much more noticeable than in animal such a cattle deer most horse and many sheep whose similarly horizontal pupil blend into a dark iris and sclera beard both male and female goat have beard and many type of goat most commonly dairy goat boer and pygmy goat may have wattle one dangling from each side of the neck tan goat expressing the tan pattern have coat pigmented completely with phaeomelanin pigment the allele which code for this pattern is located at the agouti locus of the goat genome it is completely dominant to all other allele at this locus there are multiple modifier gene which control how much tan pigment is actually expressed so a goat can have a coat ranging from pure white to deep red reproduction goat reach puberty between three and month of age depending on breed and nutritional status many breeder prefer to postpone breeding until the doe ha reached of the adult weight however this separation is rarely possible in extensively managed herdsin temperate climate and among the swiss breed the breeding season commences a the day length shortens and end in early spring or before in equatorial region goat are able to breed at any time of the year successful breeding in these region depends more on available forage than on day length doe of any breed or region come into estrus heat every day for two to hour a doe in heat typically flag vigorously wag her tail often stay near the buck if one is present becomes more vocal and may also show a decrease in appetite and milk production for the duration of the heat buck intact male of swiss and northern breed come into rut in the fall a with the doe heat cycle buck of equatorial breed may show seasonal reduced fertility but a with the doe are capable of breeding at all time rut is characterized by a decrease in appetite and obsessive interest in the doe a buck in rut will display flehmen lip curling and will urinate on his foreleg and face sebaceous scent gland at the base of the horn add to the male goat odor which is important to make him attractive to the female some doe will not mate with a buck which ha been descentedin addition to natural traditional mating artificial insemination ha gained popularity among goat breeder a it allows easy access to a wide variety of bloodline gestation length is approximately day twin are the usual result with single and triplet birth also common le frequent are litter of quadruplet quintuplet and even sextuplet kid birthing known a kidding generally occurs uneventfully just before kidding the doe will have a sunken area around the tail and hip a well a heavy breathing she may have a worried look become restless and display great affection for her keeper the mother often eats the placenta which give her nutrient help stanch her bleeding and parallel the behavior of wild herbivore such a deer to reduce the lure of the birth scent for predatorsfreshening coming into milk production occurs at kidding milk production varies with the breed age quality and diet of the doe dairy goat generally produce between and kg and lb of milk per lactation on average a good quality dairy doe will give at least kg lb of milk per day while she is in milk a milker may produce le or a much a kg lb or more of milk in exceptional case after the lactation the doe will dry off typically after she ha been bred occasionally goat that have not been bred and are continuously milked will continue lactation beyond the typical day meat fiber and pet breed are not usually milked and simply produce enough for the kid until weaning male lactation is also known to occur in goat diet goat are reputed to be willing to eat almost anything including tin can and cardboard box while goat will not actually eat inedible material they are browsing animal not grazers like cattle and sheep and coupled with their highly curious nature will chew on and taste just about anything remotely resembling plant matter to decide whether it is good to eat including cardboard clothing and paper such a label from tin can the unusual smell of leftover food in discarded can or box may further stimulate their curiosity aside from sampling many thing goat are quite particular in what they actually consume preferring to browse on the tip of woody shrub and tree a well a the occasional plant however it can fairly be said that their plant diet is extremely varied and includes some specie which are otherwise toxic they will seldom consume soiled food or contaminated water unless facing starvation this is one reason is most often since involves extensive upkeep and is seldom commercially viable goat prefer to browse on vine such a kudzu on shrubbery and on weed more like deer than sheep preferring them to grass nightshade is poisonous wilted fruit tree leaf can also kill goat silage fermented corn stalk and haylage fermented grass hay can be used if consumed immediately after opening goat are particularly sensitive to listeria bacteria that can grow in fermented feed alfalfa a plant is widely fed a hay fescue is the least palatable and least nutritious hay mold in a goat feed can make it sick and possibly kill it in various place in china goat are used in the production of tea goat are released onto the tea terrace where they avoid consuming the green tea leaf which contain bitter tasting substance but instead eat the weed the goat droppings fertilise the tea plantsthe digestive physiology of a very young kid like the young of other ruminant is essentially the same a that of a monogastric animal milk digestion begin in the abomasum the milk having bypassed the rumen via closure of the reticuloesophageal groove during suckling at birth the rumen is undeveloped but a the kid begin to consume solid feed the rumen soon increase in size and in it capacity to absorb nutrient the adult size of a particular goat is a product of it breed genetic potential and it diet while growing nutritional potential a with all livestock increased protein diet to and sufficient calorie during the prepuberty period yield higher growth rate and larger eventual size than lower protein rate and limited calorie goat with a greater skeletal size reach mature weight at a later age to month than goat to month if both are fed to their full potential goat need more calorie than goat for maintenance of daily function behavior goat are naturally curious they are also agile and well known for their ability to climb and balance in precarious place this make them the only ruminant to regularly climb tree due to their agility and inquisitiveness they are notorious for escaping their pen by testing fence and enclosure either intentionally or simply because they are used to climbing if any of the fencing can be overcome goat will almost inevitably escape goat have been found to be a intelligent a dog by some studieswhen handled a a group goat tend to display le herding behavior than sheep when grazing undisturbed they tend to spread across the field or range rather than feed side by side a do sheep when nursing young goat will leave their kid separated lying out rather than clumped a do sheep they will generally turn and face an intruder and buck are more likely to charge or butt at human than are ramsa study by queen mary university report that goat try to communicate with people in the same manner a domesticated animal such a dog and horse goat were first domesticated a livestock more than year ago research conducted to test communication skill found that the goat will look to a human for assistance when faced with a challenge that had previously been mastered but wa then modified specifically when presented with a box the goat wa able to remove the lid and retrieve a treat inside but when the box wa turned so the lid could not be removed the goat would turn and gaze at the person and move toward them before looking back toward the box this is the same type of complex communication observed by animal bred a domestic pet such a dog researcher believe that better understanding of interaction could offer overall improvement in the animal welfare the field of anthrozoology ha established that domesticated animal have the capacity for complex communication with human when in a japanese scientist determined that level of oxytocin did increase in human subject when dog were exposed to a dose of the love hormone proving that a bond doe exist this is the same affinity that wa proven with the london study above goat are intelligent capable of complex communication and able to form bond disease while goat are generally considered hardy animal and in many situation receive little medical care they are subject to a number of disease among the condition affecting goat are respiratory disease including pneumonia foot rot internal parasite pregnancy toxosis and feed toxicity feed toxicity can vary based on breed and location certain foreign fruit and vegetable can be toxic to different breed of goat goat can become infected with various viral and bacterial disease such a disease caprine arthritis encephalitis caseous lymphadenitis pinkeye mastitis and pseudorabies they can transmit a number of zoonotic disease to people such a tuberculosis brucellosis and rabies life expectancy life expectancy for goat is between and year an instance of a goat reaching the age of ha been reportedseveral factor can reduce this average expectancy problem during kidding can lower a doe expected life span to or and stress of going into rut can lower a buck expected life span to eight to year agriculture a goat is useful to human when it is living and when it is dead first a a renewable provider of milk manure and fiber and then a meat and hide some charity provide goat to impoverished people in poor country because goat are easier and cheaper to manage than cattle and have multiple us in addition goat are used for driving and packing purpose the intestine of goat is used to make catgut which is still in use a a material for internal human surgical suture and string for musical instrument the horn of the goat which signifies plenty and wellbeing the cornucopia is also used to make spoon worldwide goat population statistic according to the food and agriculture organization fao the top producer of goat milk in were india million metric ton bangladesh million metric ton and the sudan million metric ton india slaughter of million goat each year the million metric tonne of goat meat make up of india annual meat production approximately million goat are slaughtered each year for meat worldwide husbandry husbandry or animal care and use varies by region and culture the particular housing used for goat depends not only on the intended use of the goat but also on the region of the world where they are raised historically domestic goat were generally kept in herd that wandered on hill or other grazing area often tended by goatherd who were frequently child or adolescent similar to the more widely known shepherd these method of herding are still used today in some part of the world especially europe and north america distinct breed of goat are kept for dairy milk and for meat production excess male kid of dairy breed are typically slaughtered for meat both doe and buck of meat breed may be slaughtered for meat a well a older animal of any breed the meat of older buck more than one year old is generally considered not desirable for meat for human consumption castration at a young age prevents the development of typical buck odor dairy goat are generally pastured in summer and may be stabled during the winter a dairy doe are milked daily they are generally kept close to the milking shed their grazing is typically supplemented with hay and concentrate stabled goat may be kept in stall similar to horse or in larger group pen in the u system doe are generally rebred annually in some european commercial dairy system the doe are bred only twice and are milked continuously for several year after the second kidding meat goat are more frequently pastured and may be kept many mile from barn angora and other fiber breed are also kept on pasture or range and pastured goat may be supplemented with hay or concentrate most frequently during the winter or dry season in the indian subcontinent and much of asia goat are kept largely for milk production both in commercial and household setting the goat in this area may be kept closely housed or may be allowed to range for fodder the salem black goat is herded to pasture in field and along road during the day but is kept penned at night for africa and the mideast goat are typically run in flock with sheep this maximizes the production per acre a goat and sheep prefer different food plant multiple type of are found in ethiopia where four main type have been identified pastured in annual crop system in perennial crop system with cattle and in arid area under pastoral nomadic herding system in all four system however goat were typically kept in extensive system with few purchased input household goat are traditionally kept in nigeria while many goat are allowed to wander the homestead or village others are kept penned and fed in what is called a system this type of husbandry is also used in part of latin america which refers to the practice of cutting down grass corn or cane for feed rather than allowing the animal access to the field is particularly suited for type of feed such a corn or cane that are easily destroyed by tramplingpet goat may be found in many part of the world when a family keep one or more animal for emotional reason rather than a production animal it is becoming more common for goat to be kept exclusively a pet in north america and europe meat the taste of goat kid meat is similar to that of spring lamb meat in fact in the island of the caribbean and in some part of asia particularly bangladesh pakistan and india the word mutton is used to describe both goat and sheep meat however some compare the taste of goat meat to veal or venison depending on the age and condition of the goat it flavor is said to be primarily linked to the presence of and acid it can be prepared in a variety of way including stewing baking grilling barbecuing canning and frying it can be minced curried or made into sausage due to it low fat content the meat can toughen at high temperature if cooked without additional moisture one of the most popular goat grown for meat is the south african boer introduced into the united state in the early the new zealand kiko is also considered a meat breed a is the myotonic or fainting goat a breed originating in tennessee milk butter and cheese goat produce about of the world total annual milk supply some goat are bred specifically for milk if the buck is not separated from the doe his scent will affect the milk goat milk naturally ha small fat globule which mean the cream remains suspended in the milk instead of rising to the top a in raw cow milk therefore it doe not need to be homogenized indeed if the milk is to be used to make cheese homogenization is not recommended a this change the structure of the milk affecting the culture ability to coagulate the milk and the final quality and yield of cheesedairy goat in their prime generally around the third or fourth lactation cycle to kg to lb milk production to l to u qt a lactation producing more just after freshening and gradually dropping in production toward the end of their lactation the milk generally average butterfatgoat milk is commonly processed into cheese butter ice cream yogurt cajeta and other product goat cheese is known a fromage de chevre goat cheese in france some variety include rocamadour and montrachet goat butter is white because goat produce milk with the yellow converted to a colorless form of vitamin a goat milk ha le cholesterol nutrition the american academy of pediatrics discourages feeding infant milk derived from goat an april case report summarizes their recommendation and present a comprehensive review of the consequence associated with this dangerous practice also stating many infant are exclusively fed unmodified goat milk a a result of cultural belief a well a exposure to false online information anecdotal report have described a host of morbidity associated with that practice including severe electrolyte abnormality metabolic acidosis megaloblastic anemia allergic reaction including anaphylactic shock hemolytic uremic syndrome and infection untreated caprine brucellosis result in a case fatality rate according to the usda doe milk is not recommended for human infant because it contains inadequate quantity of iron folate vitamin c and d thiamine niacin vitamin and pantothenic acid to meet an infant s nutritional need and may cause harm to an infant kidney and could cause metabolic damagethe department of health in the united kingdom ha repeatedly released statement stating on various occasion that goat milk is not suitable for baby and infant formula and formula based on goat milk protein have not been approved for use in europe and infant milk based on goat milk protein are not suitable a a source of nutrition for infant moreover according to the canadian federal health department health canada most of the danger of and for feeding unmodified goat milk to infant parallel those associated with unmodified cow milk especially insofar a allergic reaction gohowever some farming group promote the practice for example small farm today in claimed beneficial use in invalid and convalescent diet proposing that glycerol ether possibly important in nutrition for nursing infant are much higher in doe milk than in cow milk a book on animal breeding claimed that doe milk differs from cow or human milk by having higher digestibility distinct alkalinity higher buffering capacity and certain therapeutic value in human medicine and nutrition george mateljan suggested doe milk can replace ewe milk or cow milk in diet of those who are allergic to certain mammal milk however like cow milk doe milk ha lactose sugar and may cause gastrointestinal problem for individual with lactose intolerance in fact the level of lactose is similar to that of cow milksome researcher and company producing goat milk product have made claim that goat milk is better for human health than most western cow milk due to it mostly lacking a form of protein called and instead mostly containing the form which doe not metabolize to in the body these composition vary by breed especially in the nigerian dwarf breed animal and point in the lactation period fiber the angora breed of goat produce long curling lustrous lock of mohair the entire body of the goat is covered with mohair and there are no guard hair the lock constantly grow to four inch or more in length angora crossbreed such a the pygora and the nigora have been created to produce mohair cashgora on a smaller animal the wool is shorn twice a year with an average yield of about kg lb most goat have softer insulating hair nearer the skin and longer guard hair on the surface the desirable fiber for the textile industry is the former and it go by several name down cashmere and pashmina the coarse guard hair are of little value a they are too coarse difficult to spin and difficult to dye the cashmere goat produce a commercial quantity of cashmere wool which is one of the most expensive natural fiber commercially produced cashmere is very fine and soft the cashmere goat fiber is harvested once a year yielding around g oz of down in south asia cashmere is called pashmina from persian pashmina fine wool in the and early century kashmir then called cashmere by the british had a thriving industry producing shawl from imported from tibet and tartary through ladakh the shawl were introduced into western europe when the general in chief of the french campaign in egypt sent one to paris since these shawl were produced in the upper kashmir and ladakh region the wool came to be known a cashmere land clearing goat have been used by human to clear unwanted vegetation for century they have been described a eating machine and biological control agent there ha been a resurgence of this in north america since when herd were used to clear dry brush from california hillside thought to be endangered by potential wildfire this form of using goat to clear land is sometimes known a conservation grazing since then numerous public and private agency have hired private herd from company such a rent a goat to perform similar task this may be expensive and their smell may be a nuisance this practice ha become popular in the pacific northwest where they are used to remove invasive specie not easily removed by human including thorned blackberry vine and poison oak chattanooga tn and spartanburg sc have used goat to control kudzu an invasive plant specie prevalent in the southeastern united state use for medical training a a goat anatomy and physiology is not too dissimilar from that of human some country military use goat to train combat medic in the united state goat have become the main animal specie used for this purpose after the pentagon phased out using dog for medical training in the while modern mannequin used in medical training are quite efficient in simulating the behavior of a human body trainee feel that the goat exercise provide s a sense of urgency that only real life trauma can provide a pet some people choose goat a a pet because of their ability to form close bond with their human guardian because of goat herd mentality they will follow their owner around and form close bond with them breed goat breed fall into overlapping general category they are generally distributed in those used for dairy fiber meat skin and a companion animal some breed are also particularly noted a pack goat showing goat breeder club frequently hold show where goat are judged on trait relating to conformation udder quality evidence of high production longevity build and muscling meat goat and pet goat and fiber production and the fiber itself fiber goat people who show their goat usually keep registered stock and the offspring of animal command a higher price registered goat in general are usually if for no other reason than that record have been kept proving their ancestry and the production and other data of their sire dam and other ancestor a registered doe is usually le of a gamble than buying a doe at random a at an auction or sale barn because of these record and the reputation of the breeder child club such a also allow goat to be shown child show often include a showmanship class where the cleanliness and presentation of both the animal and the exhibitor a well a the handler ability and skill in handling the goat are scored in a showmanship class conformation is irrelevant since this is not what is being judged various dairy goat scorecard milking doe are system used for judging show in the u the american dairy goat association adga scorecard for an adult doe includes a point system of a hundred total with major category that include general appearance the dairy character of a doe physical trait that aid and increase milk production body capacity and specifically for the mammary system young stock and buck are judged by different scorecard which place more emphasis on the other three category general appearance body capacity and dairy character the american goat society ag ha a similar but not identical scorecard that is used in their show the miniature dairy goat may be judged by either of the two scorecard the angora goat scorecard used by the colored angora goat breeder association cagba which cover the white and the colored goat includes evaluation of an animal fleece color density uniformity fineness and general body confirmation disqualification include a deformed mouth broken down pastern deformed foot crooked leg abnormality of testicle missing testicle more than inch split in scrotum and or distorted horn mythology and folklore archaeologist excavating the ancient city of ebla in syria discovered among others the tomb of some king or great noble which included a throne decorated with bronze goat head that led to this tomb becoming known a the tomb of the lord of the goat according to norse mythology the god of thunder thor ha a chariot that is pulled by the goat

have shown kindness to needy and suffering disciple of jesus and others these he will reward but the goat at his left hand who failed to show kindness will be punished although both sheep and goat were valued a livestock this preference for sheep may relate to the importance of wool and the superior meat of adult sheep compared to the poor meat of adult goat feral goat goat readily revert to the wild become feral if given the opportunity the only domestic animal known to return to feral life a swiftly is the cat feral goat have established themselves in many area they occur in australia new zealand great britain the galapagos and in many other place when feral goat reach large population in habitat which provide unlimited water supply and which do not contain sufficient large predator or which are otherwise vulnerable to goat aggressive grazing habit they may have serious effect such a removing native scrub tree and other vegetation which is required by a wide range of other creature not just other grazing or browsing animal feral goat are common in australia however in other circumstance where predator pressure is maintained they may be accommodated into some
