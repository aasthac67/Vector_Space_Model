falcon are bird of prey in the genus falco which includes about specie falcon are widely distributed on all continent of the world except antarctica though closely related raptor did occur there in the eoceneadult falcon have thin tapered wing which enable them to fly at high speed and change direction rapidly fledgling falcon in their first year of flying have longer flight feather which make their configuration more like that of a bird such a a this make flying easier while learning the exceptional skill required to be effective hunter a adult the falcon are the largest genus in the falconinae subfamily of falconidae which itself also includes another subfamily comprising caracara and a few other specie all these bird kill with their beak using a tooth on the side of their the hawk eagle and other bird of prey in the accipitridae which use their foot the largest falcon is the gyrfalcon at up to cm in length the smallest falcon specie is the pygmy falcon which measure just cm a with hawk and owl falcon exhibit sexual dimorphism with the female typically larger than the male thus allowing a wider range of prey speciessome small falcon with long narrow wing are called hobby and some which hover while hunting are called kestrel a is the case with many bird of prey falcon have exceptional power of vision the visual acuity of one specie ha been measured at time that of a normal human peregrine falcon have been recorded diving at speed of mile per hour making them the creature on earth the fastest recorded dive for one is kilometer per hour mph etymology the genus name falco is from late latin falx falcis a sickle referring to the claw of the bird in middle english and old french the title faucon refers generically to several captive raptor speciesthe traditional term for a male falcon is tercel british spelling or tiercel american spelling from the latin tertius third because of the belief that only one in three egg hatched a male bird some source give the etymology a deriving from the fact that a male falcon is about smaller than a female old french tiercelet a falcon chick especially one reared for falconry still in it downy stage is known a an eyas sometimes spelled eyas the word arose by mistaken division of old french un niais from latin presumed nidiscus nestling from nidus nest the technique of hunting with trained captive bird of prey is known a falconry systematics and evolution compared to other bird of prey the fossil record of the falcon is not well distributed in time the oldest fossil tentatively assigned to this genus are from the late miocene le than million year ago this coincides with a period in which many modern genus of bird became recognizable in the fossil record the falcon lineage may however be somewhat older than this and given the distribution of fossil and living falco taxon is probably of north american african or possibly middle eastern or european origin falcon are not closely related to other bird of prey and their nearest relative are parrot and songbird overview falcon are roughly divisible into three or four group the first contains the kestrel probably excepting the american kestrel usually small and stocky falcon of mainly brown upperside color and sometimes sexually dimorphic three african specie that are generally gray in color stand apart from the typical member of this group kestrel feed chiefly on terrestrial vertebrate and invertebrate of appropriate size such a rodent reptile or insect the second group contains slightly larger on average specie the hobby and relative these bird are characterized by considerable amount of dark in their plumage their malar area are nearly always black they feed mainly on smaller bird third are the peregrine falcon and it relative variably sized powerful bird that also have a black malar area except some very light color morphs and often a black cap a well otherwise they are somewhat intermediate between the other group being chiefly medium gray with some lighter or brownish color on their upper side they are on average more delicately patterned than the hobby and if the hierofalcons are excluded see below this group typically contains specie with horizontal barring on their underside a opposed to the other group where tail color varies much in general but little according to evolutionary relatedness however the fox and greater kestrel can be told apart at first glance by their tail color but not by much else they might be very close relative and are probably much closer to each other than the lesser and common kestrel the tail of the large falcon are quite uniformly dark gray with inconspicuous black banding and small white tip though this is probably plesiomorphic these large falco specie feed on bird and terrestrial vertebrate very similar to these and sometimes included therein are the four or so specie of hierofalcons literally they represent taxon with usually more phaeomelanins which impart reddish or brown color and generally more strongly patterned plumage reminiscent of hawk their underside have a lengthwise pattern of blotch line or arrowhead mark while these three or four group loosely circumscribed are an informal arrangement they probably contain several distinct clade in their entirety a study of mtdna cytochrome b sequence data of some kestrel identified a clade containing the common kestrel and related specie to the exclusion of such taxon a the greater kestrel which lack a malar stripe the lesser kestrel which is very similar to the common but also ha no malar stripe and the american kestrel which ha a malar stripe but it color from the brownish also the black feather behind the ear which never occur in the true kestrel are more reminiscent of some hobby the kestrel apparently split from their relative in the gelasian roughly million year ago mya and are seemingly of tropical east african origin the entire true kestrel the american probably a distinct and quite young clade a also suggested by their numerous apomorphies other study have confirmed that the hierofalcons are a monophyletic that hybridization is quite frequent at least in the larger falcon specie initial study of mtdna cytochrome b sequence data suggested that the hierofalcons are basal among living falcon the discovery of a numt proved this earlier theory erroneous in reality the hierofalcons are a rather young group originating at the same time a the start of the main kestrel radiation about mya very little fossil history exists for this lineage however the present diversity of very recent origin suggests that this lineage may have nearly gone extinct in the recent pastthe phylogeny and delimitation of the peregrine and hobby group are more problematic molecular study have only been conducted on a few specie and the morphologically ambiguous taxon have often been little researched the morphology of the syrinx which contributes well to resolving the overall phylogeny of the falconidae is not very informative in the present genus nonetheless a core group containing the peregrine and barbary falcon which in turn group with the hierofalcons and the more distant prairie falcon which wa sometimes placed with the hierofalcons though it is entirely distinct biogeographically a well a at least most of the typical hobby are confirmed to be monophyletic a suspectedgiven that the american falco specie of today belong to the peregrine group or are apparently more basal specie the initially most successful evolutionary radiation seemingly wa a holarctic one that originated possibly around central eurasia or in northern africa one or several lineage were present in north america by the early pliocene at latest the origin of today major falco typical hobby and kestrel for example or the complex or the aplomado falcon be quite confidently placed from the boundary through the zanclean and piacenzian and just into the gelasian that is from mya when the kestrel diversified some group of falcon such a the hierofalcon complex and the superspecies have only evolved in more recent time the specie of the former seem to be year old or so

more paleosubspecies of extant specie also been described see specie account for these sushkinia pliocaena from the early pliocene of pavlodar kazakhstan appears to be a falcon of some sort it might belong in this genus or a closely related one in any case the genus name sushkinia is invalid for this animal because it had already been allocated to a prehistoric dragonfly relative in the bird genus wa renamed psushkiniathe supposed falco pisanus wa actually a pigeon of the genus columba possibly the same a columba omnisanctorum which in that case would adopt the older specie name of the falcon the eocene fossil falco falconellus or f falconella from wyoming is a bird of uncertain affiliation maybe a falconid maybe not it certainly doe not belong in this genus falco readei is now
