the gaur bos gaurus also called the indian bison is native to south and southeast asia and ha been listed a vulnerable on the iucn red list since the global population ha been estimated at maximum mature individual by it declined by more than during the last three generation and is extinct in sri lanka and probably also in bangladesh in area it is stable and increasingit is the largest specie among the wild cattle in malaysia it is called seladang and pyaung in myanmar the domesticated form of the gaur is called gayal bos frontalis or mithun characteristic the gaur is a strong and massively built bovid with a high convex ridge on the forehead between the horn which protrudes anteriorly causing a deep hollow in the profile of the upper part of the head there is a prominent ridge on the back the ear are very large the tail only just reach the hock and in old bull the hair becomes very thin on the back the adult male is dark brown approaching black in very old individual the upper part of the head from above the eye to the nape of the neck is ashy grey or occasionally dirty white the muzzle is pale coloured and the lower part of the leg are pure white or tan the cow and young bull are paler and in some instance have a rufous tinge which is most marked in group inhabiting dry and open area the tail is shorter than in the typical ox reaching only to the hock they have a distinct ridge running from the shoulder to the middle of the back the shoulder may be a much a cm in higher than the rump this ridge is caused by the great length of the spinous process of the vertebra of the of the trunk a compared with those of the loin the hair is short fine and glossy the hoof are narrow and pointedthe gaur doe not have a distinct dewlap on the throat and chest both sex have horn which grow from the side of the head curving upwards between the horn is a high convex ridge on the forehead at their base they present an elliptical a characteristic that is more strongly marked in bull than in cow the horn are decidedly flattened at the base and regularly curved throughout their length and are bent inward and slightly backward at their tip the colour of the horn is some shade of pale green or yellow throughout the greater part of their length but the tip are black the horn of medium size by large bovid standard grow to a length of to cm to in the cow is considerably lighter in colour than the bull her horn are more slender and upright with more inward curvature and the frontal ridge is scarcely perceptible in young animal the horn are smooth and polished in old bull they are rugged and dented at the basethe gaur is the largest wild bovid alive today it ha a length of to cm ft in to ft in with a to cm to in long tail and is to cm ft in to ft in high at the shoulder averaging about cm ft in in female and cm ft in in male at the top of it muscular hump just behind it shoulder an average adult male is just under cm ft in tall and the male girth at it midsection behind it shoulder average about cm ft in male are about larger and heavier than female body mass range widely from to kg to lb in adult female and to kg to lb in adult male in general measurement are derived from gaur surveyed in india indian gaur male averaged about kg lb in a sample of and female weigh a median of approximately kg lb in china the shoulder height of gaur range from cm in and male weigh up to kg lb the seladang or malayasian subspecies b g hubbacki appears to be larger on average than the nominate race from india but sample size a known are small according to some source seladang bull weigh on average to kg to lb which if accurate indicates these animal are on average more than more massive than the gaur of india distribution and habitat gaur historically occurred throughout mainland south and southeast asia including vietnam cambodia lao thailand peninsular malaysia myanmar india bangladesh bhutan china and nepal today the range of the specie is seriously fragmented and it is regionally extinct in sri lankagaur are largely confined to evergreen forest or and moist deciduous forest but also occur in deciduous forest area at the periphery of their range gaur habitat is characterized by large relatively undisturbed forest tract hilly terrain below an altitude of to m to ft availability of water and an abundance of forage in the form of grass bamboo shrub and tree their apparent preference for hilly terrain may be partly due to the earlier conversion of most of the plain and other area to croplands and pasture they occur from sea level to an altitude of at least m ft area seem to comprise optimal habitatin nepal the gaur population wa estimated to be in the with the majority in chitwan national park and the adjacent parsa national park these two park are connected by a chain of forested hill population trend appeared to be relatively stable the chitwan population ha increased from to animal in the year to census conducted in parsa national park confirmed the presence of gaur in the same periodin india the population wa estimated to be in the the western ghat and their outflanking hill in southern india constitute one of the most extensive extant stronghold of gaur in particular in the wayanad nagarhole mudumalai bandipur complex the population in india bhutan and bangladesh are estimated to comprise individual major population of about individual have been reported in both nagarahole and bandipur national park over individual in tadoba andhari tiger project individual in both periyar tiger reserve and silent valley and adjoining forest complex and over individual in bhadra wildlife sanctuaryin bhutan they apparently persist all over the southern foothill zone notably in royal manas national park phibsoo wildlife sanctuary and khaling wildlife sanctuaryin bangladesh a few gaur occur in the chittagong hill tract mostly in banderban district during a camera trap project few gaur were recorded indicating that the population is fragmented and probably declining gaur are hunted by local tribal people in sangu matamuhari reserve forest although hunting is prohibited in bangladeshin thailand gaur were once found throughout the country but fewer than individual were estimated to have remained in the in the mostly dong phayayen khao yai forest complex they were recorded at low density at the turn of the century with an estimated total of about individualsin vietnam several area in dak lak province were known to contain gaur in several herd persist in cat tien national park and in adjacent state forest enterprise the current status of the gaur population is poorly known they may be in serious declinein cambodia gaur declined considerably in the period from the late to the early the most substantial population of the country remained in mondulkiri province where up to individual may have survived in a forested landscape of over sq mi result of camera trapping carried out in suggested a globally significant population of gaur in the mondulkiri protected forest and the contiguous phnom prich wildlife sanctuaryin lao up to individual were estimated to inhabit protected area boundary in the they were reported discontinuously distributed in low number overhunting had reduced the population and survivor occurred mainly in remote site fewer than six national biodiversity conservation area held more than individual area with population likely to be nationally important included the nam theun catchment and the adjoining plateau subsequent survey carried out a decade later using fairly intensive camera trapping did not record any gaur any more indicating a massive decline of the populationin china gaur occur in heavily fragmented population in yunnan and southeastern tibet by the they were extirpated in lancang county and the remaining animal were split into two population viz in and cangyuan in the a population of individual may have lived in yunnan province with the majority occurring in xishuangbanna national nature reserve ecology and behaviour where gaur have not been disturbed they are basically diurnal in other area they have become largely nocturnal due to human impact on the forest in central india they are most active at night and are rarely seen in the open after in the morning during the dry season herd congregate and remain in small area dispersing into the hill with the arrival of the monsoon while gaur depend on water for drinking they do not seem to bathe or wallowin january and february gaur live in small herd of eight to individual one of which is a bull in april or may more bull may join the herd for mating and individual bull may move from herd to herd each mating with many cow in may or june they leave the herd and may form herd of bull only or live alone herd wander km mi each day each herd ha a nonexclusive home range and sometimes herd may join in group of or moregaur herd are led by an old adult female the matriarch adult male may be solitary during the peak of the breeding season unattached male wander widely in search of receptive female no serious fighting between male ha been recorded with size being the major factor in determining dominance male make a mating call of clear resonant tone which may carry for more than km mi gaur have also been known to make a whistling snort a an alarm call and a low mooin some region in india where human disturbance is minor the gaur is very timid and shy despite their great size and power when alarmed gaur crash into the jungle at a surprising speed however in southeast asia and south india where they are used to the presence of human gaur are said by local to be very bold and aggressive they are frequently known to go into field and graze alongside domestic cattle sometimes killing them in fight gaur bull may charge without provocation especially during summer when the intense heat and parasitic insect make them more than usual to warn other member of it herd of approaching danger the gaur let out a high whistle for help feeding ecology wild gaur graze and browse on a wider variety of plant than any other ungulate specie of india with a preference for the upper portion of plant such a leaf blade stem seed and flower of grass specie including kadamduring a survey in the bhagwan mahaveer sanctuary and mollem national park specie of plant were identified a food for gaur they consume herb young shoot flower fruit of elephant apple dillenia ssp with a high preference for leaf food preference varies by season in winter and monsoon they feed on preferably fine and fresh grass and herb specie of the legume family such a tick clover desmodium triflorum but also browse on leaf of shrub specie such a karvy strobilanthes callosus indian boxwood gardenia latifolia crossberry grewia abutifolia screw tree helicteres ssp and the chaste tree vitex negundo in summer they also feed on bark of teak tectona grandis on fruit of golden shower tree cassia fistula and on the bark and fruit of cashew anacardium occidentale gaur spent most of their daily time feeding peak feeding activity wa observed between and am and between and pm during the hottest hour of the day to pm they rest in the shade of big treesthey may debark tree due to shortage of preferred food and of mineral and trace element needed for their nutrition or for maintaining an optimum ratio for proper digestion of food and better assimilation of nutrient they may turn to available browse specie and fibrous teak bark in summer a green grass and herbaceous resource dry up high concentration of calcium ppm and phosphorus ppm have been reported in teak bark so consumption of teak bark may help animal to satisfy both mineral and other food need survival and conservation of these herbivore depend on the availability of preferred plant specie for food hence protection of the historically preferred habitat used by gaur is a significant factor in conservation biology reproduction sexual maturity occurs in the gaur second or third year female have one calf rarely two after a gestation period of about day a few day le than domestic cattle calf are typically weaned after seven to month breeding take place but typically peak between december and june the lifespan of a gaur in captivity is up to year natural predator due to their formidable size and power gaur have few natural predator besides human leopard dhole pack and large mugger crocodile occasionally attack unguarded calf or unhealthy animal only tiger and saltwater crocodile have been reported to kill adult gaur however the habitat and distribution of gaur and saltwater crocodile seldom overlap in recent time due to the decreasing range of both specie a crocodile likely would need to be a mature adult male more than m ft and kg lb to make a successful attack on healthy adult gaurstigers hunt young or infirm gaur but have also been reported to have killed healthy bull weighing at least kg lb a video of a tiger killing a female gaur wa recorded in the bandipur tiger reserve in october when confronted by a tiger the adult member of a gaur herd often form a circle surrounding the vulnerable young and calf shielding them from the big cat a tiger rely on ambush attack when taking on prey a large a a gaur they will almost always abandon a hunt if detected and met in this manner a herd of gaur in malaysia encircled a calf killed by a tiger and prevented it from approaching the carcass gaur are capable of chasing off and killing tiger in an old tigress in navegaon nagzira tiger reserve appears to have died after being wounded by a gaurgaur are not a aggressive toward human a wild water buffalo threat in lao gaur are highly threatened by poaching for trade to supply international market but also by opportunistic hunting and specific hunting for home consumption in the they were particularly sought by vietnamese poacher for their commercial valuein thailand gaur are highly threatened by poaching for commercial trade in meat and trophy conservation bos gaurus is listed in cite appendix i and is legally protected in all range state cryoconservation of animal genetic resource have been put into place in order to help reinforce the gaur population in captivity on january the first cloned gaur wa born at trans ovum genetics in sioux center iowa the calf wa carried and brought successfully to term by a surrogate mother a domestic cow bos taurus while healthy at birth the calf died within hour of a common dysentery most likely unrelated to cloning taxonomy bison gaurus wa the scientific name proposed by charles hamilton smith in later author subordinated the specie under either bos or bibosin the international commission on zoological nomenclature ha fixed the first available specific name based on a wild population that the name for this wild specie is valid by virtue of it being antedated by a name based on a domestic form most author have adopted the binomial bos gaurus for the wild specie a valid for the taxontraditionally three gaur subspecies have been recognized b g gaurus range in india nepal and bhutan b g readei described by richard lydekker in based on a specimen from myanmar is thought to range from upper myanmar to tanintharyi region b g hubbacki described by lydekker in based on a specimen from pahang in peninsular malaysia it wa considered to range in peninsular malaysia and probably northward to tenasserim this classification based largely on difference in coloration and size is no longer widely recognizedin recognition of phenotypic difference between indian and southeast asian specimen the trinominals bos gaurus gaurus and bos gaurus
