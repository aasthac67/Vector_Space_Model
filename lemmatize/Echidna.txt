echidna sometimes known a spiny anteater belong to the family tachyglossidae in the monotreme order of mammal the four extant specie of echidna and the platypus are the only living mammal that lay egg and the only surviving member of the order monotremata the diet of some specie consists of ant and termite but they are not closely related to the true anteater of the america which are xenarthrans along with sloth and armadillo echidna live in australia and new guinea echidna evolved between and million year ago descending from a monotreme this ancestor wa aquatic but echidna adapted to life on land etymology the echidna are named after echidna a creature from greek mythology who wa a the animal wa perceived to have quality of both mammal and reptile description echidna are solitary mammal covered with coarse hair and spine superficially they resemble the anteater of south america and other spiny mammal such a hedgehog and porcupine they are usually black or brown in colour there have been several report of albino echidna their eye pink and their spine white they have elongated and slender snout that function a both mouth and nose like the platypus they are equipped with electrosensors but while the platypus ha electroreceptors on it bill the echidna ha only electroreceptors and the echidna which life in a drier environment ha no more than located at the tip of it snout they have very short strong limb with large claw and are powerful digger their claw on their hind limb are elongated and curved backwards to help aid in digging echidna have tiny mouth and toothless jaw the echidna feed by tearing open soft log anthill and the like and using it long sticky tongue which protrudes from it snout to collect prey the ear are slit on the side of their head that are usually unseen a they are blanketed by their spine the external ear is created by a large cartilaginous funnel deep in the muscle at the echidna also posse the second lowest active body temperature of all mammal behind the platypus diet the echidna diet consists largely of ant and termite while the zaglossus specie typically eat worm and insect larva the tongue of echidna have sharp tiny spine that help them capture their prey they have no teeth and break down their food by grinding it between the bottom of their mouth and their tongue echidna faeces are cm in long and are cylindrical in shape they are usually broken and unrounded and composed largely of dirt and material habitat echidna do not tolerate extreme temperature they use cave and rock crevice to shelter from harsh weather condition echidna are found in forest and woodland hiding under vegetation root or pile of debris they sometimes use the burrow of animal such a rabbit and wombat individual echidna have large mutually overlapping territoriesdespite their appearance echidna are capable swimmer when swimming they expose their snout and some of their spine and are known to journey to water in order to groom and bathe themselves anatomy echidna and the platypus are the only mammal known a monotreme the average lifespan of an echidna in the wild is estimated around year when fully grown a female can weigh up to kilogram lb and a male can weigh up to kilogram lb the echidna sex can be inferred from their size a male are larger than female on average the reproductive organ also differ but both sex have a single opening called a cloaca which they use to urinate release their faeces and to matemale echidna have spur on the hind feetthe neocortex make up half of the echidna brain compared to of a human brain due to their low metabolism and accompanying stress resistance echidna are for their size the longest recorded lifespan for a captive echidna is year with anecdotal account of wild individual reaching year contrary to previous research the echidna doe enter rem sleep but only when the ambient temperature is around at temperature of and rem sleep is suppressed reproduction the female lay a single leathery egg day after mating and deposit it directly into her pouch an egg weighs to gram to oz and is about centimetre in long while hatching the baby echidna open the leather shell with a egg tooth hatching take place after day of gestation the young echidna called a puggle born larval and then suck milk from the pore of the two milk patch monotreme have no nipple and remains in the pouch for to day at which time it start to develop spine the mother dig a nursery burrow and deposit the young returning every five day to suckle it until it is weaned at seven month puggles will stay within their mother den for up to a year before leavingmale echidna have a penis during mating the head on one side shut down and do not grow in size the other two are used to release semen into the female reproductive tract each time it copulates it alternate head in set of two when not in use the penis is retracted inside a preputial sac in the cloaca the male echidna penis is centimetre in long when erect and it shaft is covered with penile spine these may be used to induce ovulation in the femaleit is a challenge to study the echidna in it natural habitat and they show no interest in mating while in captivity prior to no one had ever seen an echidna ejaculate there have been previous attempt trying to force the echidna to ejaculate through the use of electrically stimulated ejaculation in order to obtain semen sample but ha only resulted in the penis swellingbreeding season begin in late june and extends through september male will form line up to ten individual long the youngest echidna trailing last that follow the female and attempt to mate during a mating season an echidna may switch between line this is known a the train system threat echidna are very timid animal when they feel endangered they attempt to bury themselves or if exposed they will curl into a ball similar to that of a hedgehog both method using their spine to shield them strong front arm allow echidna to continue to dig themselves in whilst holding fast against a predator attempting to remove them from the hole although they have a way to protect themselves the echidna still face many danger some predator include feral cat fox domestic dog and goannas snake pose a large threat to the echidna specie because they slither into their burrow and prey on the young spineless puggles some precaution that can be taken include keeping the environment clean by picking up litter and causing le pollution planting vegetation for echidna to use a shelter supervising pet reporting hurt echidna or just leaving them undisturbed merely grabbing them may cause stress and picking them up improperly may even result in injury evolution the first divergence between oviparous and viviparous offspring develop internally mammal is believed to have occurred during the triassic period however there is still some disagreement on this estimated time of divergence though most finding from genetics study especially those concerning nuclear gene are in agreement with the paleontological finding some result from other technique and source like mitochondrial dna are in slight disagreement with finding from fossilsmolecular clock data suggest echidna split from platypus between and million year ago and that fossil dating back to over million year ago therefore represent basal form rather than close relative of the modern platypus this would imply that echidna evolved from ancestor that returned to living completely on the land even though this put them in competition with marsupial further evidence of possible ancestor can be found in some of the echidna phenotypic trait a well these trait include hydrodynamic streamlining dorsally projecting hind limb acting a rudder and locomotion founded on hypertrophied humeral rotation which provides a very efficient swimming stroke consequently oviparous reproduction in monotreme may have given them an advantage over marsupial a view consistent with present ecological partitioning between the two group this advantage could a well be in part responsible for the observed associated adaptive radiation of echidna and expansion of the niche space which together contradict the fairly common assumption of halted morphological and molecular evolution that continues to be associated with monotreme furthermore study of mitochondrial dna in platypus have also found that monotreme and marsupial are most likely sister taxon it also implies that any shared derived morphological trait between marsupial and placental mammal either occurred independently from one another or were lost in the lineage to monotreme taxonomy echidna are classified into three genus the genus zaglossus includes three extant specie and two specie known only from fossil while only one extant specie from the genus tachyglossus is known the third genus megalibgwilia is known only from fossil zaglossus the three living zaglossus specie are endemic to new guinea they are rare and are hunted for food they forage in leaf litter on the forest floor eating earthworm and insect the specie are western echidna z bruijni of the highland forest sir david echidna z attenboroughi discovered by western science in described in and preferring a still higher habitat eastern echidna z bartoni of which four distinct subspecies have been identifiedthe two fossil specie are robustus hacketti tachyglossus the echidna tachyglossus aculeatus is found in southern southeast and northeast new guinea and also occurs in almost all australian environment from the australian alp to the deep desert of the outback essentially anywhere ant and termite are available it is smaller than the zaglossus specie and it ha longer hair despite the similar dietary habit and method of consumption to those of an anteater there is no evidence supporting the idea that monotreme have been myrmecophagic ant or since the cretaceous the fossil evidence of bandicoot and from around the time of the divergence and tachyglossus show evidence that echidna expanded into new ecospace despite competition from marsupial megalibgwilia the genus megalibgwilia is known only from fossil m ramsayi from late pleistocene site in australia m robusta from miocene site in australia a food aboriginal australian regard the echidna a a food delicacythe kunwinjku people of western arnhem land call the echnidna ngarrbek and regard it a a prized food and medicine reverend peterson nganjmirra personal comment echidna is hunted at night after being gutted it is filled with hot stone and bush herb namely the leaf of mandak persoonia falcata according to larrakia elder una thompson and stephanie thompson nganjmirra when captured echidna is carried attached to the wrist like a thick bangle in popular culture the echidna appears on the reverse of the australian coin knuckle the echidna is a popular character from the sonic the hedgehog video game franchise
