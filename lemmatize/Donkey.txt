the donkey or as equus africanus asinus is a domesticated member of the horse family equidae the wild ancestor of the donkey is the african wild as e africanus the donkey ha been used a a working animal for at least year there are more than million donkey in the world mostly in underdeveloped country where they are used principally a draught or pack animal working donkey are often associated with those living at or below subsistence level small number of donkey are kept for breeding or a pet in developed country a male donkey or as is called a jack a female a jenny or jennet a young donkey is a foal jack donkey are often used to mate with female horse to produce mule the biological reciprocal of a mule from a stallion and jenny a it parent instead is called a hinny ass were first domesticated around bc probably in egypt or mesopotamia and have spread around the world they continue to fill important role in many place today while domesticated specie are increasing in number the african wild as is an endangered specie a beast of burden and companion ass and donkey have worked together with human for millennium scientific and common name traditionally the scientific name for the donkey is equus asinus asinus based on the principle of priority used for scientific name of animal however the international commission on zoological nomenclature ruled in that if the domestic specie and the wild specie are considered subspecies of one another the scientific name of the wild specie ha priority even when that subspecies wa described after the domestic subspecies this mean that the proper scientific name for the donkey is equus africanus asinus when it is considered a subspecies and equus asinus when it is considered a specie at one time the synonym as wa the more common term for the donkey the first recorded use of donkey wa in either or while the word as ha cognate in most other language donkey is an etymologically obscure word for which no credible cognate ha been identified hypothesis on it derivation include the following perhaps from spanish for it gravity the donkey wa also known a the king of spain trumpeter perhaps a diminutive of dun dull a typical donkey colour perhaps from the name duncan perhaps of imitative originfrom the century donkey gradually replaced as and jenny replaced which is now considered archaic the change may have come about through a tendency to avoid pejorative term in speech and be comparable to the substitution in north american english of rooster for cock or that of rabbit for coney which wa formerly homophonic with cunny a variation of the word cunt by the end of the century change in pronunciation of both as and arse had caused them to become homophone in some variety of english other word used for the as in english from this time include cuddy in scotland neddy in southwest england and dicky in the southeast moke is documented in the century and may be of welsh or gypsy origin characteristic donkey vary considerably in size depending on breed and management the height at the withers range from to hand to inch to cm and the weight from to kg to lb working donkey in the poorest country have a life expectancy of to year in more prosperous country they may have a lifespan of to yearsdonkeys are adapted to marginal desert land unlike wild and feral horse wild donkey in dry area are solitary and do not form harem each adult donkey establishes a home range breeding over a large area may be dominated by one jack the loud call or bray of the donkey which typically last for twenty second and can be heard for over three kilometre may help keep in contact with other donkey over the wide space of the desert donkey have large ear which may pick up more distant sound and may help cool the donkey blood donkey can defend themselves by biting striking with the front hoof or kicking with the hind leg breeding a jenny is normally pregnant for about month though the gestation period varies from to month and usually give birth to a single foal birth of twin are rare though le so than in horse about percent of donkey pregnancy result in twin both foal survive in about percent of those in general jenny have a conception rate that is lower than that of horse ie le than the rate for mare although jenny come into heat within or day of giving birth their fertility remains low and it is likely the reproductive tract ha not returned to normal thus it is usual to wait one or two further oestrous cycle before rebreeding unlike the practice with mare jenny are usually very protective of their foal and some will not come into estrus while they have a foal at side the time lapse involved in rebreeding and the length of a jenny gestation mean that a jenny will have fewer than one foal per year because of this and the longer gestation period donkey breeder do not expect to obtain a foal every year a horse breeder often do but may plan for three foal in four yearsdonkeys can interbreed with other member of the family equidae and are commonly interbred with horse the hybrid between a jack and a mare is a mule valued a a working and riding animal in many country some large donkey breed such a the asino di martina franca the baudet de poitou and the mammoth jack are raised only for mule production the hybrid between a stallion and a jenny is a hinny and is le common like other hybrid mule and hinny are usually sterile donkey can also breed with zebra in which the offspring is called a zonkey among other name behaviour donkey have a notorious reputation for stubbornness but this ha been attributed to a much stronger sense of than exhibited by horse likely based on a stronger prey instinct and a weaker connection with human it is considerably more difficult to force or frighten a donkey into doing something it perceives to be dangerous for whatever reason once a person ha earned their confidence they can be willing and companionable partner and very dependable in workalthough formal study of their behaviour and cognition are rather limited donkey appear to be quite intelligent cautious friendly playful and eager to learn history the genus equus which includes all extant equine is believed to have evolved from dinohippus via the intermediate form plesippus one of the oldest specie is equus simplicidens described a with a head the oldest fossil to date is million year old from idaho usa the genus appears to have spread quickly into the old world with the similarly aged equus livenzovensis documented from western europe and russiamolecular phylogeny indicate the most recent common ancestor of all modern equid member of the genus equus lived mya direct paleogenomic sequencing of a middle pleistocene horse metapodial bone from canada implies a more recent myr before present date for the most recent common ancestor mrca within the range of to myr bp the oldest divergency are the asian hemiones subgenus e asinus including the kulan onager and kiang followed by the african zebra subgenus e dolichohippus and e hippotigris all other modern form including the domesticated horse and many fossil pliocene and pleistocene form belong to the subgenus e equus which diverged million year ago the ancestor of the modern donkey are the nubian and somalian subspecies of african wild as remains of domestic donkey dating to the fourth millennium bc have been found in in lower egypt and it is believed that the domestication of the donkey wa accomplished long after the domestication of cattle sheep and goat in the seventh and eighth millennium bc donkey were probably first domesticated by pastoral people in nubia and they supplanted the ox a the chief pack animal of that culture the domestication of donkey served to increase the mobility of pastoral culture having the advantage over ruminant of not needing time to chew their cud and were vital in the development of trade across egypt in the dynasty iv era of egypt between and bc wealthy member of society were known to own over donkey employed in agriculture a dairy and meat animal and a pack animal in the tomb of either king narmer or king two of the first egyptian pharaoh wa excavated and the skeleton of ten donkey were found buried in a manner usually used with high ranking human these burial show the importance of donkey to the early egyptian state and it ruler by the end of the fourth millennium bc the donkey had spread to southwest asia and the main breeding center had shifted to mesopotamia by bc the breeding of large white riding ass made damascus famous while syrian breeder developed at least three other breed including one preferred by woman for it easy gait the muscat or yemen as wa developed in arabia by the second millennium bc the donkey wa brought to europe possibly at the same time a viticulture wa introduced a the donkey is associated with the syrian god of wine dionysus greek spread both of these to many of their colony including those in what are now italy france and spain roman dispersed them throughout their empirethe first donkey came to the america on ship of the second voyage of christopher columbus and were landed at hispaniola in the first to reach north america may have been two animal taken to mexico by juan de zumarraga the first bishop of mexico who arrived there on december while the first donkey to reach what is now the united state may have crossed the rio grande with juan de onate in april from that time on they spread northward finding use in mission and mine donkey were documented a present in what today is arizona in by the gold rush year of the century the burro wa the beast of burden of choice of early prospector in the western united state with the end of the placer mining boom many of them escaped or were abandoned and a feral population established itself present status about million donkey were reported worldwide in china had the most with million followed by pakistan ethiopia and mexico a of however the chinese population wa reported to have dropped to million with african population under pressure a well due to increasing trade and demand for donkey product in china some researcher believe the actual number may be somewhat higher since many donkey go uncounted the number of breed and percentage of world population for each of the fao world region wa in in the number of donkey in the world wa reported to be continuing to grow a it had steadily done throughout most of history factor cited a contributing to this were increasing human population progress in economic development and social stability in some poorer nation conversion of forest to farm and range land rising price of motor vehicle and fuel and the popularity of donkey a pet since then the world population of donkey is reported to be rapidly shrinking falling from million to million between and and to only million in the fall in population is pronounced in developed country in europe the total number of donkey fell from million in to just over million in domestic animal diversity information system of the fao listed breed of as in june in the number of breed of donkey recorded worldwide wa and in it wa the rapid increase is attributed to attention paid to identification and recognition of donkey breed by the fao animal genetic resource project the rate of recognition of new breed ha been particularly high in some developed country in france for example only one breed the baudet de poitou wa recognised prior to the early by a further six donkey breed had official recognitionin prosperous country the welfare of donkey both at home and abroad ha become a concern and a number of sanctuary for retired and rescued donkey have been set up the largest is the donkey sanctuary near sidmouth england which also support donkey welfare project in egypt ethiopia india kenya and mexico us economic use the donkey ha been used a a working animal for at least year of the more than million donkey in the world about are in underdeveloped country where they are used principally a pack animal or for draught work in transport or agriculture after human labour the donkey is the cheapest form of agricultural power they may also be ridden or used for threshing raising water milling and other work working donkey are often associated with those living at or below subsistence level some culture that prohibit woman from working with ox in agriculture do not extend this taboo to donkey allowing them to be used by both sexesin developed country where their use a beast of burden ha disappeared donkey are used to sire mule to guard sheep for donkey ride for child or tourist and a pet donkey may be pastured or stabled with horse and pony and are thought to have a calming effect on nervous horse if a donkey is introduced to a mare and foal the foal may turn to the donkey for support after it ha been weaned from it mothera few donkey are milked or raised for meat approximately million donkey and mule are slaughtered each year for meat worldwide in italy which ha the highest consumption of equine meat in europe and where donkey meat is the main ingredient of several regional dish about donkey were slaughtered in yielding approximately tonne of meat ass milk may command good price the average price in italy in wa per litre and a price of per ml wa reported from croatia in it is used for soap and cosmetic a well a dietary purpose the niche market for both milk and meat are expanding in the past donkey skin wa used in the production of parchment in the uk based charity the donkey sanctuary estimated that million skin were traded every year but the demand could be a high a millionin china donkey meat is considered a delicacy with some restaurant specializing in such dish and guo li zhuang restaurant offer the genitals of donkey in dish gelatin is produced by soaking and stewing the hide to make a traditional chinese medicine product ejiao the gelatine produced by boiling donkey skin can sell for up to per kilo at october pricesin a drop in the number of chinese donkey combined with the fact that they are slow to reproduce meant that chinese supplier began to look to africa a a result of the increase in demand and the price that could be charged kenya opened three donkey abattoir concern for donkey however have resulted in a number of african country including uganda tanzania botswana niger burkina faso mali and senegal banning china from buying their donkey productsin the donkey sanctuary warned that the global donkey population could be reduced by half over the next half decade a the demand for ejiao increase in china in warfare during world war i john simpson kirkpatrick a british stretcher bearer serving with the australian and new zealand army corp and richard alexander dick henderson of the new zealand medical corp used donkey to rescue wounded soldier from the battlefield at gallipoliaccording to british food writer matthew fort donkey were used in the italian army the mountain fusilier each had a donkey to carry their gear and in extreme circumstance the animal could be eatendonkeys have also been used to carry explosive in conflict that include the war in afghanistan and others care shoeing donkey hoof are more elastic than those of horse and do not naturally wear down a fast regular clipping may be required neglect can lead to permanent damage working donkey may need to be shod donkey shoe are similar to horseshoe but usually smaller and without nutrition in their native arid and climate donkey spend more than half of each day foraging and feeding often on poor quality scrub the donkey ha a tough digestive system in which roughage is efficiently broken down by hind gut fermentation microbial action in the caecum and large intestine while there is no marked structural difference between the tract of a donkey and that of a horse the digestion of the donkey is more efficient it need le food than a horse or pony of comparable height and weight approximately percent of body weight per day in dry matter compared to the percent consumption rate possible for a horse donkey are also le prone to colic the reason for this difference are not fully understood the donkey may have different intestinal flora to the horse or a longer gut retention time donkey obtain most of their energy from structural carbohydrate some suggest that a donkey need to be fed only straw preferably barley straw supplemented with controlled grazing in the summer or hay in the winter to get all the energy protein fat and vitamin it requires others recommend some grain to be fed particularly to working animal and others advise against feeding straw they do best when allowed to consume small amount of food over long period they can meet their nutritional need on to hour of grazing per day on average dryland pasture that is not stressed by drought if they are worked long hour or do not have access to pasture they require hay or a similar dried forage with no more than a ratio of legume to grass they also require salt and mineral supplement and access to clean fresh water in temperate climate the forage available is often too abundant and too rich may cause weight gain and obesity and lead to metabolic disorder such a founder laminitis and hyperlipaemia or to gastric ulcersthroughout the world working donkey are associated with the very poor with those living at or below subsistence level few receive adequate food and in general donkey throughout the third world are and burro in the iberian peninsula and hispanic america a burro is a small donkey burro is the spanish word for donkey the domestic animal diversity information system of the fao list the burro a a specific breed of as in mexico the donkey population is estimated at three million there are also substantial burro population in el salvador guatemala and nicaragua burro is the spanish and portuguese word for donkey in spanish burro may also be called burro mexicano donkey burro criollo donkey or burro criollo mexicano in the united state burro is used a a loan word by english speaker to describe any small donkey used primarily a a pack animal a well a to describe the feral donkey that live in arizona california oregon utah texas and nevadaamong donkey burro tend to be on the small side a study of working burro in central mexico found a weight range of kilogram lb with an average weight of kg lb for male and kg lb for female height at the withers varied from cm in with an average of approximately cm in and girth measurement ranged from cm in with an average of about cm in the average age of the burro in the study wa year evaluated by their teeth they ranged from to year old they are gray in color mexican burro tend to be smaller than their counterpart in the u which are both larger and more robust to strengthen their bloodstock in may the state of jalisco imported male and female donkey from kentucky feral donkey and wild ass in some area domestic donkey have returned to the wild and established feral population such a those of the burro of north america and the asinara donkey of sardinia italy both of which have protected status feral donkey can also cause problem notably in environment that have evolved free of any form of equid such a hawaii in australia where there may be million feral donkey they are regarded a an invasive pest and have a serious impact on the environment they may compete with livestock and native animal for resource spread weed and disease foul or damage watering hole and cause erosion wild ass onager and kiang few specie of as exist in the wild the african wild as equus africanus ha two subspecies the somali wild as equus africanus somaliensis and the nubian wild as equus africanus africanus the principal ancestor of the domestic donkey both are critically endangered extinct specie include the european as equus hydruntinus which became extinct during the neolithic and the north african wild as equus africanus atlanticus which became extinct in roman timesthere are five subspecies of asiatic wild as or onager equus hemionus and three subspecies of the kiang equus kiang of the himalayan upland donkey hybrid a male donkey jack can be crossed with a female horse to produce a mule a male horse can be crossed with a female donkey jenny to produce a hinny hybrid are almost always sterile because horse have chromosome whereas donkey have producing offspring with chromosome mule are much more common than hinny this is believed to be caused by two factor the first being proven in cat hybrid that when the chromosome count of the male is the higher fertility rate drop the lower progesterone production of the jenny may also lead to early embryonic loss in addition there are reason not directly related to reproductive biology due to different mating behavior jack are often more willing to cover mare than stallion are to breed jenny further mare are usually larger than jenny and thus have more room for the ensuing foal to grow in the womb resulting in a larger animal at birth it is commonly believed that mule are more easily handled and also physically stronger than hinny making them more desirable for breeder to producethe offspring of a cross is called a zonkey zebroid zebra or zedonk zebra mule is an older term but still used in some region today the foregoing term generally refer to hybrid produced by breeding a male zebra to a female donkey zebra hinny zebret and zebrinny all refer to the cross of a female zebra with a male donkey zebrinnies are rarer than zedonkies because female zebra in captivity are most valuable when used to produce zebra there are not enough female zebra breeding in captivity to spare them for hybridizing there is no such limitation on the number of female donkey breeding see also bomb attack cultural reference to donkey jennet a type of medieval horse reference external link origin of the donkey in popular
