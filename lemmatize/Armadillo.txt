armadillo meaning little armoured one in spanish are new world placental mammal in the order cingulata the chlamyphoridae and dasypodidae are the only surviving family in the order which is part of the superorder xenarthra along with the anteater and sloth nine extinct genus and extant specie of armadillo have been described some of which are distinguished by the number of band on their armour all specie are native to the america where they inhabit a variety of different environment armadillo are characterized by a leathery armour shell and long sharp claw for digging they have short leg but can move quite quickly the average length of an armadillo is about cm in including tail the giant armadillo grows up to cm in and weighs up to kg lb while the pink fairy armadillo ha a length of only cm in when threatened by a predator tolypeutes specie frequently roll up into a ball these being the only specie of armadillo capable of such etymology the word armadillo mean little armoured one in spanish the aztec called them ayotochtli nahuatl for ayotl turtle and tochtli rabbit the portuguese word for armadillo is tatu which is derived from the tupi language similar name are also found in other especially european language classification family dasypodidae subfamily dasypodinae genus dasypus armadillo or armadillo dasypus novemcinctus armadillo dasypus septemcinctus southern armadillo

tolypeutes matacus brazilian armadillo tolypeutes indicates extinct taxon phylogeny below is a recent simplified phylogeny of the xenarthran family which includes armadillo based on slater et al and delsuc et al the dagger symbol denotes extinct group evolution recent genetic research suggests that an extinct group of giant armoured mammal the glyptodonts should be included within the lineage of armadillo having diverged some million year ago more recently than previously assumed distribution like all of the xenarthra lineage armadillo originated in south america due to the continent former isolation they were confined there for most of the cenozoic the recent formation of the isthmus of panama allowed a few member of the family to migrate northward into southern north america by the early pleistocene a part of the great american interchange some of their much larger cingulate relative the pampatheres and chlamyphorid glyptodonts made the same journey today all extant armadillo specie are still present in south america they are particularly diverse in paraguay where specie exist and surrounding area many specie are endangered some including four specie of dasypus are widely distributed over the america whereas others such a yepes mulita are restricted to small range two specie the northern armadillo and armadillo are found in central america the latter ha also reached the united state primarily in the state notably texas but with a range that extends a far east a north carolina and florida and a far north a southern nebraska and southern indiana their range ha consistently expanded in north america over the last century due to a lack of natural predator characteristic size armadillo are small to mammal the smallest specie the pink fairy armadillo is roughly at g oz and cm in in total length the largest specie the giant armadillo can reach the size of a small pig and weigh up to kg lb and can be cm in long diet and predation they are prolific digger many specie use their sharp claw to dig for food such a grub and to dig den the armadillo prefers to build burrow in moist soil near the creek stream and arroyo around which it life and feed the diet of different armadillo specie vary but consist mainly of insect grub and other invertebrate some specie however feed almost entirely on ant and termite armadillo have very poor eyesight and use their keen sense of smell to hunt for food they use their claw for digging and finding food a well a for making their home in burrow they dig their burrow with their claw making only a single corridor the width of the animal body they have five clawed toe on their hind foot and three to five toe with heavy digging claw on their fore foot armadillo have numerous cheek teeth which are not divided into premolar and molar but usually have no incisor or canine the dentition of the armadillo is p m body temperature in common with other xenarthrans armadillo in general have low body temperature of and low basal metabolic rate of that expected in placental mammal of their mass this is particularly true of type that specialize in using termite a their primary food source for example priodontes and tolypeutes skin the armour is formed by plate of dermal bone covered in relatively small overlapping epidermal scale called scute composed of bone with a covering of horn most specie have rigid shield over the shoulder and hip with a number of band separated by flexible skin covering the back and flank additional armour cover the top of the head the upper part of the limb and the tail the underside of the animal is never armoured and is simply covered with soft skin and furthis skin appears to be the main defense of many armadillo although most escape predator by fleeing often into thorny patch from which their armour protects them or digging to safety only the south american armadillo tolypeutes rely heavily on their armour for protection defensive behavior when threatened by a predator tolypeutes specie frequently roll up into a ball other armadillo specie can not roll up because they have too many plate the north american armadillo tends to jump straight in the air when surprised so consequently often collides with the undercarriage or fender of passing vehicle to it demise movement armadillo have short leg but can move quite quickly the armadillo is noted for it movement through water which is accomplished via two different method it can walk underwater for short distance holding it breath for a long a six minute also to cross larger body of water it is capable of increasing it buoyancy by swallowing air inflating it stomach and intestine reproduction gestation last from to day depending on specie although the armadillo also exhibit delayed implantation so the young are not typically born for eight month after mating most member of the genus dasypus give birth to four monozygotic young that is identical quadruplet but other specie may have typical litter size that range from one to eight the young are born with soft leathery skin which hardens within a few week they reach sexual maturity in three to twelve month depending on the specie armadillo are solitary animal that do not share their burrow with other adult armadillo and human in science disease armadillo are often used in the study of leprosy since they along with mangabey monkey rabbit and mouse on their footpad are among the few known specie that can contract the disease systemically they are particularly susceptible due to their unusually low body temperature which is hospitable to the leprosy bacterium mycobacterium leprae the leprosy bacterium is difficult to culture and armadillo have a body temperature of similar to human skin human can acquire a leprosy infection from armadillo by handling them or consuming armadillo meat armadillo are a presumed vector and natural reservoir for the disease in texas louisiana and florida prior to the arrival of european in the late century leprosy wa unknown in the new world given that armadillo are native to the new world at some point they must have acquired the disease from humansthe armadillo is also a natural reservoir for chaga disease reproduction the armadillo also serf science through it unusual reproductive system in which four genetically identical offspring are born the result of one original egg because they are always genetically identical the group of four young provides a good subject for scientific behavioral or medical test that need consistent biological and genetic makeup in the test subject this is the only reliable manifestation of polyembryony in the class mammalia and exists only within the genus dasypus and not in all armadillo a is commonly believed other specie that display this trait include parasitoid wasp certain flatworm and various aquatic invertebrate education armadillo mainly dasypus are common roadkill due to their habit of jumping ft vertically when startled which put them into collision with the underside of vehicle wildlife enthusiast are using the northward march of the armadillo a an opportunity to educate others about the animal which can be a burrowing nuisance to property owner and manager a musical instrument armadillo shell have traditionally been used to make the back of the charango an andean lute instrument a food in certain part of central and south america armadillo meat is eaten it is a popular ingredient in oaxaca mexico during the great depression american were known to eat armadillo known begrudgingly a hoover hog a nod to the belief that herbert hoover wa responsible for the economic despair facing the nation at that time in literature a whimsical account of the beginning of the armadillo is one of the chapter of rudyard
