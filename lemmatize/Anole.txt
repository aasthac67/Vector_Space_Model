dactyloidae are a family of lizard commonly known a anole u listen and native to warmer part of the america ranging from southeastern united state to paraguay instead of treating it a a family some authority prefer to treat it a a subfamily dactyloinae of the family iguanidae in the past they were included in the family polychrotidae together with polychrus bush anole but the latter genus is not closely related to the true anolesanoles are small to fairly large lizard typically green or brownish but their color varies depending on specie and many can also change it in most specie at least the male ha a dewlap an often brightly colored flap of skin that extends from the and is used in display anole share several characteristic with gecko including detail of the foot structure for climbing and the ability to voluntarily break off the tail to escape predator but they are only very distantly related anole being part of iguaniaanoles are active during the day and feed mostly on small animal such a insect but some will also take fruit flower and nectar they are fiercely territorial after mating the female lay an egg occasionally two in many specie she may do so every few day or week the egg is typically placed on the ground but in some specie it is placed at higher levelsanoles are widely studied in field such a ecology behavior and evolution and some specie are commonly kept in captivity a pet anole can function a a biological pest control by eating insect that may harm human or plant but represent a serious risk to small native animal and ecosystem if introduced to region outside their home range distribution and habitat anole are a very diverse and plentiful group of lizard they are native to tropical and subtropical south america central america mexico the offshore east pacific coco gorgona and malpelo island the west indie and southeastern united statesa particularly high specie richness exists in cuba more than specie hispaniola more than mexico more than central america colombia more than and ecuador at least fewer live in eastern and central south america for example le than specie are known from huge brazil contiguous united state native specie and the lesser antilles about specie in total with specie on each island however the lesser antilles are relatively rich compared to their very small land area and their specie are all highly localized endemic each only found on one or a few diminutive island in south america the diversity is considerably higher west of the andes region than east amazon basin a well illustrated in ecuador where about of the anole specie live in the former region and in the latter the only specie native to the contiguous united state is the carolina or green anole which range a far west a central texas and north to oklahoma tennessee and virginia it northern limit is likely related to cold winter temperature several anole specie have been introduced to the contiguous u mostly florida but also other gulf coast state and california the most prevalent of these introduction is the brown anole in contrast to the contiguous united state puerto rico and the virgin island are home to native specie all endemicanoles inhabit a wide range of habitat from highland up to at least m or ft above sea level to the coast and rainforest to desert scrub a few live in limestone karst habitat and at least two of these the cuban cave anole and mexican cave anole will enter cave sometimes occurring a much a m ft from the entrance some specie live close to human and may use fence or wall of building a perch even inhabiting garden or tree along road in large city like miami most anole are arboreal or but there are also terrestrial and specie they are often especially in the caribbean grouped into six giant trunk crown trunk trunk ground twig and grass inhabit specific niche other le widely used group are ground ground bush twig giant saxicolous and riparian alternatively however the specie within each ecomorph group are not entirely alike and there are variation in the detail of their niche including both widespread generalist and more restricted specialist the niche differentiation allows several anole to inhabit the same locality with up to specie at a single site appearance and behavior anole vary in size male generally reach a larger size than female but in a few specie it is the other way around adult of most anole are between and cm in in length and between and cm in in total length including the tail in the smallest the grass anole the length is about and cm and in in female and male respectively but it is a relatively specie there are several large specie that are more than cm in in length male of the largest the knight anole reach up to about cm in in length cm in in total length and g oz in weight there are both robust and gracile specie and the head shape varies from relatively broad to elongatethe tail of anole varies but mostly it is longer than the length depending on exact specie it can range from slightly shorter to about three time the the caribbean twig ecomorph anole proboscis anole and phenacosaurus anole have a prehensile tail anole tend to have relatively tall vertically flattened tail that aid in swimmingunderneath an anole toe are pad that have several to a dozen flap of skin adhesive lamella going horizontally and covered in microscopic hairlike protrusion seta that allow them to cling to many different surface similar to but not quite a efficient a a gecko despite this similarity they are very distantly related and the adaption are the result of convergent evolution in the two group the extent of these structure and clinging ability varies being more developed in anole specie that live high in the tree canopy than one living at lower level in one extreme are anole that easily can run up window in the opposite end of the spectrum is the bulky anole of arid coastal venezuela and adjacent colombia which is the only specie completely lacking the specialized toe pad structure the relative length of the limb vary mainly between different specie but to some extent also between different population of a single specie this depends on thing like the preferred perch size and whether there are predator in a habitatdespite having relatively small eye their primary sense is sight which is excellent and in color their pupil are round or nearly round the guantanamo anole and cuban cave anole have a transparent window in their lower eyelid allowing them to see even with closed eye but why they have this adaption is unclear anole have a good directional hearing which is able to detect frequency between and hz and relatively low intensity sound like the click of a cameraanoles are during the can also be active during bright moonlit night and may forage near artificial light many specie frequently bask in the sun to increase their temperature but others are and do not color most anole are brownish or green but there are extensive variation depending on the exact specie the majority can change their color depending on thing like emotion for example aggression or stress activity level level of light and a a social signal for example displaying dominance but evidence showing that they do it in response to the color of the background camouflage is lacking whether they do it in response to temperature thermoregulation is le clear with study supporting it and contradicting it the extent and variation of this color changing ability differ widely throughout the individual specie for example the carolina or green anole can change it color from a bright leafy green to a dull brown color while the brown anole can only change it shade ranging from pale to very dark brown even the distinct change in the carolina anole can happen in only a few minute the color are the result of their skin pigment cell the chromatophores of which they have three main type but the change occurs only in the melanophores when triggered by hormone and other hormone the melanosomes of the melanophores partially cover the other skin pigment cell giving the anole a darker or browner color in most case stress result in a color but in the aquatic anole a specie that is dark brown with a barred pattern and light brown stripe on the side of it body and head stress result in paler brown upperparts and the stripe turn pale color during the night when sleeping often differ distinctly from their color during the day where awake among these are some specie that otherwise do not drastically change their color including certain anole that generally are brown during the day changing to greenish or whitish when sleeping at night and certain anole that generally are green during the day changing to brown when sleeping at night disregarding color change minor individual variation in the basic color and pattern mostly related to sex or age are common in some anole specie this variation is more pronounced and not only related to sex and age an example of this is the basic color of the cayman anole which varies geographically roughly matching the main habitat at a location in others it occurs at the same location this includes the extensive individual variation in the guadeloupean anole which however also show some geographic variation but possibly not consistent enough due in part to cline to make the typically recognized subspecies valid in the puerto rican giant anole a specie only able to perform minor color change essentially juvenile are and adult typically green but an uncommon morph maintains a color into adulthood similarly rare morphs of the usually green carolina anole lack certain pigment cell giving them a mainly or yellow color dewlap not specie have dewlap made of erectile cartilage modified from the hyoid and covered in skin that extend from their throat area when not in use and closed it lie inconspicuously along the throat and chest the size shape color and pattern of the dewlap vary extensively depending on specie and often it differs between the sex being smaller in some absent le colorful in female in a few specie including the carolina bark cochran gianthead and slender anole it varies geographically in color depending on subspecies or morph very locally distinct morphs of a single specie that differ in dewlap color not just difference between sex may occur together in addition to color that are visible to human dewlap can have ultraviolet reflectance which is visible to anole the striped anole is the only specie where it is asymmetrically colored being brighter on one side than the other in some specie even juvenile have a dewlap the west cuban and cuban stream anole are the only where both sex lack a dewlap but it is reduced and diminutive in about a dozen other speciesthe dewlap serf a a signal for attracting partner territoriality deterring predator and communicating condition when several anole live together the specie almost always differ in their dewlap indicating that it play a role in specie recognition study however reveal a more complex pattern the bark anole and shortnosed anole specie complex which includes the webster and cochran gianthead anole are closely related and both vary in their dewlap color in place where their range overlap their dewlap often differ and there is little hybridization but in some location their dewlap are alike where alike there can be higher level of hybridization indicating that they are more likely to confuse each other or level can be a low a region where they differ indicating that something else allows them to separate each other another example is the stout and anole which are sister specie that overlap in range and are very similar except for their dewlap color they are highly aggressive to individual of their own specie but not the other when one specie ha it dewlap color modified to resemble the other only a relatively minor or no increase in aggression occurs indicating that they still can separate each otherseveral other iguania genus draco otocryptis polychrus sarada and sitana have evolved relatively large movable dewlap independently of the anole sexual dimorphism in some anole the sex are very similar and difficult to separated under normal viewing condition but most specie exhibit clear sexual dimorphism which allows one to fairly easily discern between adult male and female in a few specie the female is slightly larger than the male but in others the sex are about the same size however in most the male are larger in some more than three time the mass of female this size difference can result in difference in the microhabitat for example male using larger branch than female and feeding male on average eating large prey between the sex of a single specie male of some specie have proportionally far longer head than female but in others it is nearly alike the crest along the nape back tail is larger in the male in specie with tall crest this difference can be obvious but in specie it is often inconspicuous and easily overlooked especially when not raised the dewlap is often larger in male in some specie only the male ha a dewlap in a few there are difference in the shape of the nose but this is only known to be prominent in the proboscis and anole which both have male and more normal looking female it is likely that something similar can be seen in smooth anole but the female of that specie is still unknown a le obvious difference between anole sex is the enlarged scale in malesthe male of many specie are overall more brightly colored while female are duller more cryptic and sometimes their upperparts have striped or lined pattern that serve to break up the outline of the anole in general the juvenile color and pattern resemble those of the adult female the dewlap tends to be more colorful in male with clear difference being common among anole of the mainland of the america and comparatively rarer in the caribbean specie territoriality and breeding anole are highly territorial and will fan their dewlap bob their head perform raise their crest and do a wide range of other behavior to scare away potential competitor if this doe not scare off the intruder a fight proceeds in which the two anole attempt to bite each other during fight some specie of anole are known to vocalize in addition to the behavior indicating dominance anole may move their head up and down in a display not to be confused with the display where entire frontal part of body is moved through which is a submissive sign female maintain a feeding territory male maintain a larger breeding territory which overlap with the feeding territory of one or several female the home range is generally larger in male than in female and larger in large anole specie than in smaller in a very small specie like the bahoruco anole the home range can be a little is about sq ft and sq ft in a female and male compared to a large specie like the knight anole where they average about sq ft and sq ft if removed from it territory an anole will usually be able to find it way back home in a relatively short time but exactly how they do this is unclear being highly solitary animal anole will only infrequently congregate but in colder region individual may rest adjacent to each other in group during the winterin addition to difference in the appearance of the dewlap the frequency of the dewlap and the frequency and amplitude of the head bobbing differ between specie allowing them to separate each other territoriality is typically aimed at other individual of the same specie but in a few case it is also directed towards other anole a can be seen between the crested and cook anole unlike most anole with widely overlapping range these two inhabit very similar niche and directly compete for resource the breeding period varies in specie or population living in highly seasonal region it is generally relatively short typically during the wet season it is prolonged often even in specie or population living in region with le distinct season in some specie where it is the egg production is however higher during the rainy season than the dry season and in many where it is prolonged but not it begin in the spring and end in the fall male attract and court female by performing a range of behavior often mirroring those used to scare away competitor including extending their dewlap and bobbing their head during mating the male insert one of his hemipenes into the female cloaca fertilizing the egg inside the oviduct the female may mate with multiple male but is also able to store sperm inside her body for fertilization of egg several month after mating a female anole produce an egg in each ovary meaning that when one is maturing in one of her follicle the yolk of another is forming in the other the white shell only form when the egg ha been fertilized and female will sometimes lay infertile unshelled yellowish egg known a slug the female lay one occasionally two egg per time which typically is placed casually on the ground among under debris log or rock or in a small hole in some specie it is placed at higher level in a bromeliad tree hole or rock crevice a small number of specie lay their egg together forming a communal nest among these is the unusual cuban cave anole where a many a egg may be glued together in a small cavity on the side of a cave wall a nest that contained egg from the bay anole and the gecko sphaerodactylus armasi and tarentola crombiei represents the only known communal nest for an anole and the only known communal nest involving more than one family of lizard although typically only laying a single egg per time clutch female of many anole specie can lay an egg every five day to four week some only have a single clutch per year while other specie may have a many a on average depending on specie anole egg hatch after about day feeding anole are opportunistic feeder and may attempt to eat any attractive meal that is of the right size they primarily feed on insect like fly grasshopper cricket caterpillar moth butterfly beetle and ant and arachnid like spider several specie will also eat small vertebrate such a mouse small bird including nestling lizard including other anole specie and cannibalism of their own and frog the cuban false chameleon anole chamaeleolis are specialized and a few specie like the cuban stream anole may catch prey in water such a shrimp and fish in some specie the average varies with the individual anole size age and sex with juvenile anole eating the smallest prey adult female taking prey and adult male the largest prey in other specie there are no clear difference in the preferred prey size regardless of an individual size and sexhunting is done by sight and they generally show a strong preference for moving prey over many will chase down or sneak up to a potential prey item while others are predator that pounce on prey when it get close to the anole anole have numerous small sharp and pointed teeth that allow them to efficiently grab their prey they are heterodonts with each tooth in the frontal half of the jaw having a single tip unicuspid and each in the rear half having three tip tricuspid one in the middle and a smaller behind and in front of it unusually the cuban false chameleon anole have enlarged and blunt teeth in the rear part of their jaw allowing them to crush the shell of their snail preyin addition to animal prey many anole specie will take plant material notably fruit flower and nectar and overall they are best described a omnivorous some specie like the knight anole may function a seed dispersers anole have been recorded drinking sweetened water from hummingbird feeder anole are vulnerable to drying out and generally need access to water for drinking like dew or rain on leaf although some specie are le susceptible to water loss than others and are able to live in relatively arid place predator avoidance and deterrence a wide range of animal will eat anole such a large spider centipede predatory katydid snake large frog lizard bird monkey and carnivoran mammal at least in part of their range snake may be the most significant predator of anole for example the caribbean alsophis and borikenophis racer and the mexican central american and south american oxybelis vine snake feed mostly on lizard like anole some snake have a specialized venom that ha little effect on human but it rapidly kill an anole on some caribbean island anole make up a much a of the diet of american kestrel large anole may eat smaller individual of other anole specie and smaller individual of their own also widespread there is a documented case of a small anole being captured and killed by an outside potted venus flytrap plantanoles mainly detect potential enemy by sight but their hearing range also closely match the typical vocal range of bird if hearing a predatory bird like a kestrel or hawk they increase their vigilance when hearing a bird little or no change happens most anole specie will try to escape from a predator by rapidly running or climbing away but some will move to the opposite side of a tree trunk facing away from the attacker jump to the ground from their perch or freeze when disturbed hoping the adversary doe not spot it some anole specie will show their fitness by displaying their dewlap when encountering a predator the greater the endurance of the anole the greater the display conversely when suddenly forced to share their habitat with an efficient anole predator like the northern lizard for example if it is introduced to a place where formerly not present the anole may decrease the amplitude of their head bobbing making them le conspicuous and may become slower to emerge from hiding le willing to take a risk after having been scared by a predator anole like the twig ecomorphs of the caribbean and many dactyloa specie of mainland central and south america are generally cryptically colored and often coordinate their movement with the wind resembling the surrounding vegetation a few specie will attempt to escape from predator by diving into water or running bipedally across it similar to basilisk however the anole lack the specialized toe fringe that help basilisk when doing this anole tail often have the ability to break off at special segment which is known a autotomy the tail continues to wriggle for a period after detaching attracting the attention of the predator and commonly allowing the anole to escape the tail is regenerated but it take more than two month to complete this process about two dozen anole including almost all member of the latifrons specie group all in the chamaeleonides specie group and the la palma anole do not have the ability to autotomize the tailif caught or cornered anole will bite in this can be relatively effective against some predator when fighting back and biting sometimes for a much a minute puerto rican crested anole escape from more than of all attack by puerto rican racer snake some specie of anole will vocalize typically rowls chirp or squeal when caught evolution the evolution of anole ha been widely studied and they have been described a a textbook example of adaptive radiation and convergent evolution especially the widespread convergent evolution seen in anole living in the greater antilles ha attracted the attention of scientist and resulted in comparison with the darwin finch of the galapagos island lemur of madagascar and cichlid fish in the african great lake ecomorphs and origin on each major greater antillean island cuba hispaniola puerto rico and jamaica there are anole specie that have adapted to specific niche and are referred to a ecomorphs crown giant trunk crown trunk trunk ground twig and grass bush a few additional le widely used ecomorphs also exist however even within the greater antilles there are difference depending on island size and the amount of available habitat the largest cuba and hispaniola have all six primary ecomorphs while the smaller puerto rico and jamaica have five and four respectively specie living in a specific niche on each island tend to resemble each other in both appearance and behavior for example the escambray twig anole of cuba closely resembles the puerto rican twig and jamaican twig anole a well a several specie of twig ecomorphs from hispaniola despite this they are not closely related and have adapted to their specific niche independently of each other at least four of the six primary ecomorphs are of ancient origin a they have been documented in amber fossil from hispaniola that are about million year old the two missing ecomorphs are crown giant and grass bush otherwise there are few known fossil but early phylogenetic and immunological study indicate that anole originated million year ago first inhabitant central or south america and then came to the caribbean initially likely cuba or hispaniola a more recent phylogenetic study published in indicated that anole originated in south america and diverged from other reptile far earlier about million year ago while a south american origin ha been generally accepted the very high age ha been controversial and other study published in arrived at a lower age estimating that anole diverged from other reptile or million year ago while a comprehensive study from estimated about million year ago this indicates that early anole arrived on the greater antillean island in the caribbean from the mainland of the america via rafting rather than overland via ancient now submerged land bridge after arriving in the caribbean they diversified into several new group and one of these the norops lineage later made it way back to mainland of the america specie and adaptability specie level evolution in anole can be very slow martinique originally consisted of four tiny island which then merged into a single a a result of uplifting anole lived on each of the tiny ancient island and were isolated six to eight million year ago despite this long separation they did not experience allopatric speciation a mixed couple of the different martinique anole population can successfully reproduce and remain part of a single specie the barbados anole is part of the same group but barbados remains a separate isolated island the genetic divergence between the different martinique anole population is similar to that between other lesser antillean anole consistently recognized a separate specie another lesser antillean specie the guadeloupean anole ha several distinct population that generally are recognized a subspecies however guadeloupean anole exhibit high individual variability and the population widely intergrade something that possibly ha been enhanced by habitat change by human allowing population to easier come into contact with each other and translocation of individual this indicates that the subspecies are invalid today genetic study confirm that strong assortative mating between the different guadeloupean anole population doe not exist despite their distinct difference in appearance and them having separated about year ago confidence interval starting at year hybridization between different anole specie ha rarely been documentedin contrast to this anole can change rapidly in response to change and they are one of the few known example of visible evolution ie where change happen at a speed where they can be observed within a human lifetime together with group like stickleback fish guppy and peromyscus beach mouse in study of brown anole introduced to florida it ha been seen that they can become in a single generation when living with the predatory northern lizard anole are slower and easier to catch for the lizard over a longer period however their leg become shorter which are better suited for perching on smaller branch higher off the ground out of reach for the lizard when brown anole are introduced to small island with low vegetation their leg become shorter better suited for rapidly moving among the shrunken shrubbery to catch insect and avoid predatory bird furthermore in a study where brown anole were introduced to seven small bahaman island anole had disappeared because of hurricane france it wa seen all population became within a few wa proportional to the of the founder in other word the few founder brown anole introduced to one island were than the few introduced to another both population became over time but the first remained than the second this is an example of the founder effect similarly when brown anole were introduced to florida the native carolina or green anole moved to higher perch and gained larger toe pad better suited for those perch this adaptation occurred in just generation anole are also adapting to life with human puerto rican crested anole living in city have developed more adhesive lamella on their toe pad than one living in forest reflecting the need for being able to climb very smooth surface like window in the former habitat in contrast to these fast change anole adaptability to temperature change ha traditionally been considered relatively minor nevertheless when puerto rican crested anole in florida where introduced in the were compared to the original native population in puerto rico it wa discovered that the former had become adapted to colder temperature by about an even faster adaption wa observed in carolina anole from texas during the unusually cold winter of carolina anole living in central texas and further north were already adapted to relatively cold temperature but those of southern texas were not however after the winter of the cold tolerance of the southern texan population had increased by a much a and their genomic profile had changed to more closely resemble the more northerly living carolina anole taxonomy the name for this group of lizard originates from the carib anoli it wa modified and used in french creole and then transferred to english via the genus name anolis coined by french zoologist francois marie daudin in family name have been used for the anole in recent decade initially they were placed in iguanidae this family then comprising several very different group wa split into eight family in with anole being part of polychrotidae together with polychrus bush anole however genetic study have shown that polychrus is closer to hoplocercidae than the true anole the true anole are closer to corytophanidae basilisk and relative the true anole have therefore been transferred to their own family dactyloidae alternatively listed a subfamily dactyloinae of family iguanidae the name anolidae cope ha sometimes been used but it is a junior synonym of dactyloidae fitzinger more than specie of true anole are known new specie are regularly described including in alone most of the recent discovery have been from the mainland of the america with fewer new anole described from the comparatively caribbean island genus traditionally all the true anole were included in the genus anolis and some continue to use this treatment in which case it is the largest genus of reptile an attempt of dividing this huge genus wa already made in when they were placed in two major group the alpha anole comprising most anole subgroup and beta anole equalling today norops in the following decade other change were recommended this included a proposal to recognize four genus anolis chamaeleolis chamaelinorops and phenacosaurus in in it wa proposed that eight should be recognized the four from and ctenonotus dactyloa norops and semiurus the last wa later replaced by it senior synonym xiphosurus these change were adopted by some and rejected by others who continued placing all in anolis in the first comprehensive molecular study of the anole were published confirming the earlier suspicion that the beta anole are a monophyletic group but the alpha anole are not furthermore the genus split proposed in and caused problem a the narrowly defined anolis wa not monophyletic in a major review based on several type of data both molecular and morphological revealed several group and partially confirmed the genetic result from no major change were proposed and all anole were maintained in a broadly defined anolis two recent study primarily genetic and published in and confirmed several of the group found in earlier study but rejected others they found that the anole fall into eight primary clade some of these can be further subdivided for example chamaeleolis from cuba is one of two subclades within xiphosurus and it is sometimes considered a valid genus in which case xiphosurus is restricted to hispaniola puerto rico and nearby smaller island in contrast the earlier proposed genus phenacosaurus from the andes and tepui highland in northwestern south america is now included in dactyloa the phylogenetic position of most specie is clear but in a few the available evidence is conflicting labelled with considerable statistic uncertaintythe relationship of dactyloidae can be described with a cladogram whether the eight group are best recognized a separate genus or only a clade within a single genus anolis is disputed a few family between polychrotidae and are not shown relationship with human anole are model organism often studied in field such a ecology behavior physiology and evolution the carolina or green anole is the anole specie with the earliest dedicated study being more than year old from the late the carolina anole wa the first reptile where the entire genome wa sequencedanoles are harmless to human but if caught or cornered they will bite in a typical of animal the bite force is strongly correlated to the size of the anole it cause little pain in the smaller anole which usually do not break the skin large specie have relatively strong jaw lined with small sharp teeth and their bite can be painful and result in a superficial wound but it is still essentially harmlesssome anole specie are commonly kept in captivity a pet and especially the carolina or green anole is often described a a good beginner reptile but it too requires specialized careanoles can function a a biological pest control by eating pest insect that may harm human or plant anole abundance can be considerably higher in diversified agroecosystems multiple different plant type than agroecosystems typically only one or very few plant type and regular use of agrochemicals making the former particularly suitable for this type of pest control however because of their potential of becoming invasive specie releasing anole outside their native range is strongly discouraged and often illegal even if the specie occurs elsewhere in a country for example it is illegal to release carolina anole in california a it native range is in southeastern united state conservation the willingness of many anole of living close to human in heavily altered habitat have made them common some anole can occur in very high density a illustrated by the saint vincent bush puerto rican bush and spotted anole where it ha been estimated that there locally are almost individual per hectare per acre in the first specie and at least per hectare per acre in the last two however in most specie the density is lower and in rare anole it is can be well below individual per hectare per acre some are restricted to specific habitat such a primary rainforest making them more vulnerable in a review in it wa found that more than anole specie had a known total range that covered sq mi or le around their type locality a of april only anole equalling le than of the total number of recognized specie had been rated by the iucn most of these are either least concern not threatened or data deficient limited available data prevents an assessment but are considered vulnerable endangered and critically endangered typical threat to these are habitat loss from both human and extreme weather or by introduced specie for example the finca cere anole a critically endangered specie only known from a single unprotected location in matanzas province cuba ha suffered habitat loss both due to hurricane and expanding agricultural land a amplisquamosus an endangered specie only known from highland forest in the cusuco national park region of honduras wa common in the early but by it had experienced a drastic decline and wa only infrequently encountered a clear explanation for this is lacking although it may be related to habitat loss due to human development and agriculture similarly a landestoyi which only wa described in and ha not been rated by the iucn is restricted to the loma charco azul reserve in hispaniola but it is seriously threatened by continuing illegal habitat destruction by agriculture livestock grazing and production of wood charcoal another example of a specie that ha not been rated by the iucn is the strikingly colored blue anole from colombia gorgona island it is threatened from deforestation and predation by the introduced western basilisk certain highly localized specie can be threatened by other anole the cook anole found only in southwestern puerto rico and considered endangered by the puerto rico department of natural and environmental resource face habitat loss and fragmentation from human development predation by introduced specie especially cat and rat and direct competition from a more widespread native the puerto rican crested anole the puerto rican crested anole ha also been introduced to dominica where it locally is outcompeting the endemic dominican anole having already largely displaced the south caribbean ecotype traditionally subspecies anolis o oculatus which possibly may require a captive breeding program to ensure it survivalnevertheless anole overall do not appear to have experienced the widespread extinction and extirpation prevalent among larger caribbean reptile the culebra island giant anole is the only anole considered possibly extinct in recent history other extinct anole are prehistoric and only known from fossil remains that are million of year old local reported sighting of the culebra island giant anole a recent a the but this likely involved misidentifications of young green iguana others at least the morne constant anole do not grow a large today a they once didspecies restricted to a specific habitat in relatively remote region infrequently visited by biologist looking for reptile are often virtually unknown and rarely recorded in a review in it wa found that anole specie only were known from their holotype these may truly be rare and seriously threatened a the proboscis anole a specie that only wa known from a single specimen collected in until it wa rediscovered in cloud forest of ecuador in in others with few record like the neblina anole this is not the case it wa initially known from six specimen from the remote neblina highland in venezuela but when the brazilian part of these highland were visited in it wa discovered that the specie wa locally abundant some specie are easily overlooked even if common for example if searching for orces andes anole during the night when asleep they can be fairly easy to find but if visiting the same location during the day it can be very difficult to find any a introduced specie when introduced to region outside their native range by human anole may become invasive and represent a serious threat to small local animal such introduction may happen by mistake for example a stowaway on garden plant or deliberately a predator introduced to combat insect or release of pet anole people no longer want in the contiguous united state the carolina anole ha been introduced to california the brown anole ha been introduced to the gulf coast state and california and the knight jamaican giant bark puerto rican crested cuban green and hispaniolan green anole have been introduced to florida the barbados and morne constant anole have also been recorded in florida but do not appear to have become established there are indication that the invasive brown anole is displacing the native carolina anole in florida and texas by outcompeting it and eating it young in the most disturbed habitat the carolina anole may disappear entirely but in le disturbed habitat where there is more cover allowing young to avoid predation it may remain fairly common although it is forced to occur higher in tree where le visible to human regardless the carolina anole is common and widespread overall and it ha itself been introduced to several region outside it native range including california kansa hawaii guam palau the bahamas cayman island anguilla belize tamaulipas in mexico and japan okinawa and ogasawara bonin island although there are several record from spain both the mainland and the canary island none of these have become established in japan ogasawara island the introduced carolina anole have caused decline in native lizard and diurnal insect including the of the endemic celastrina ogasawaraensis butterfly and five dragonfly specie this may be due to the ecological naivete of the insect before the introduction there were no diurnal highly arboreal lizard and a very high anole density on these japanese island a similar insect decline have not been reported from the bahamas which already had
