the beaver genus castor is a large primarily nocturnal semiaquatic rodent castor includes two extant specie the north american beaver castor canadensis native to north america and eurasian beaver castor fiber eurasia beaver are known for building dam canal and lodge home they are the rodent in the world after the capybara their colony create one or more dam to provide still deep water to protect against predator and to float food and building material the north american beaver population wa once more than million but a of wa million a similar trend occurred in europe with only around individual remaining at the turn of the century this population decline is the result of extensive hunting for fur for gland used a medicine and perfume and because the beaver harvesting of tree and flooding of waterway may interfere with other land us general beaver along with pocket gopher and kangaroo rat are castorimorph rodent a suborder of rodent mostly restricted to north america although just two closely related specie exist today beaver have a long fossil history in the northern hemisphere beginning in the eocene and many specie of giant beaver existed until quite recently such a trogontherium in europe and castoroides in north america beaver are known for their natural trait of building dam on river and stream and building their home known a lodge in the resulting pond beaver also build canal to float building material that are difficult to haul over land they use powerful front teeth to cut tree and other plant that they use both for building and for food in the absence of existing pond beaver must construct dam before building their lodge first they place vertical pole then fill between the pole with a crisscross of horizontally placed branch they fill in the gap between the branch with a combination of weed and mud until the dam impounds sufficient water to surround the lodge they are known for their alarm signal when startled or frightened a swimming beaver will rapidly dive while forcefully slapping the water with it broad tail audible over great distance above and below water this serf a a warning to beaver in the area once a beaver ha sounded the alarm nearby beaver will dive and may not reemerge for some time beaver are slow on land but are good swimmer and can stay under water for a long a minute beaver do not hibernate but store stick and log in a pile in their pond eating the underbark some of the pile is generally above water and accumulates snow in the winter this insulation of snow often keep the water from freezing in and around the food pile providing a location where beaver can breathe when outside their lodge beaver have webbed and a broad scaly tail they have poor eyesight but keen sens of hearing smell and touch a beaver teeth grow continuously so they will not be worn down by chewing on wood their four incisor are composed of hard orange enamel on the front and a softer dentin on the back the end of incisor are maintained by their wear pattern the enamel in a beaver incisor contains iron and is more resistant to acid than enamel in the teeth of other mammalsbeavers continue to grow throughout their life adult specimen weighing over kg lb are not uncommon female are a large a or larger than male of the same age which is uncommon among mammal beaver live up to year of age in the wild etymology the english word beaver come from the old english word beofor or befer recorded earlier a bebr which in turn sprang from the root bebruz cognate in other germanic language include the old saxon bibar the old norse bjorr the middle dutch and dutch bever the low german bever the old high german bibar and the modern german biber the word in turn came from the pie word bhebhrus a reduplication of the pie root meaning brown or bright whose own descendant now include the lithuanian bebras and the czech bobr a well a the germanic form specie the north american and eurasian beaver are the only extant member of the family castoridae contained within the genus castor genetic research ha shown the modern european and north american beaver population to be distinct specie and that hybridization is unlikely although superficially similar to each other there are several important difference between the two specie eurasian beaver tend to be slightly larger with larger le rounded head longer narrower muzzle thinner shorter and lighter underfur narrower le tail and shorter shin bone making them le capable of bipedal locomotion than the north american specie eurasian beaver have longer nasal bone than their north american cousin with the widest point being at the end of the snout for the former and in the middle for the latter the nasal opening for the eurasian specie is triangular unlike that of the north american which is square the foramen magnum is rounded in the eurasian beaver and triangular in the north american the anal gland of the eurasian beaver are larger and with a large internal volume compared to that of the north american specie the guard hair of the eurasian beaver have a longer hollow medulla at their tip fur colour is also different overall of eurasian beaver have pale brown or beige fur have reddish brown nearly are brown and only have blackish coat in north american beaver have pale brown fur are reddish brown are brown and are blackishthe two specie are not genetically compatible north american beaver have chromosome while eurasian beaver have more than attempt were made in russia to hybridize the two specie with one breeding between a male north american beaver and a female european resulting in a single stillborn kit these factor make interspecific breeding unlikely in area where the two specie range overlap eurasian beaver the eurasian beaver castor fiber wa hunted nearly to extinction in europe both for fur and for castoreum a secretion from it scent gland believed to have medicinal property however the beaver is now being throughout europe several thousand live on the elbe and the rhone and in part of scandinavia a thriving community life in northeast poland and the eurasian beaver also returned to the morava river bank in slovakia and the czech republic they have been reintroduced in scotland knapdale bavaria austria netherlands serbia zasavica bog denmark west jutland and bulgaria and are spreading to new location the beaver became extinct in great britain in the sixteenth century giraldus cambrensis reported in itinerarium iiiii that it wa to be found only in the teifi in wale and in one river in scotland though his observation are clearly second hand in kent wildlife trust successfully introduced a family of beaver at ham fen the last remaining ancient fenland in the county close to the town of sandwich these are now established and are breeding in october six eurasian beaver were reintroduced to britain in lower mill estate in gloucestershire in july a colony of four eurasian beaver wa established at martin mere in lancashire and a small population of probably eurasian beaver is being monitored in devon a trial occurred in scotland in may feasibility study for a reintroduction to wale are at an advanced stage and a preliminary study for a reintroduction of beaver to the wild in england ha recently been published north american beaver the north american beaver castor canadensis also called the canadian beaver which is also the name of a subspecies american beaver or simply beaver in north america is native to canada much of the united state and the state of sonora and chihuahua in northern mexico this specie wa introduced to the argentine and chilean tierra del fuego a well a finland france poland and russiathe north american beaver prefer the inner bark of aspen and poplar but will also take birch maple willow alder black cherry red oak beech ash hornbeam and occasionally pine and spruce they will also eat cattail water lily and other aquatic vegetation especially in the early spring and contrary to widespread belief they do not eat fish these animal are often trapped for their fur during the early century trapping eliminated this animal from large portion of it original range beaver fur were used to make clothing and much of the early exploration of north america wa driven by the quest for this animal fur native people and early settler also ate this animal meat the federal lacey act wa passed by the u fish and wildlife service in which forbade any take of wildlife or plant in violation of indian state or foreign law through trap and transfer and habitat conservation beaver made a nearly complete recovery by the current beaver population ha been estimated to be to million one estimate claim there may have been at one time a many a million habitat the primary habitat of the beaver is the riparian zone inclusive of stream bed the action of beaver for hundred of thousand of year in the northern hemisphere have kept these watery system healthy and in good repair however some beaver inhabit the intertidal zone in river estuary building dam to trap high tide in a beaver pond for similar purposesthe beaver work a a keystone specie in an ecosystem by creating wetland that are used by many other specie next to human no other extant animal appears to do more to shape it landscape beaver potentially even affect climate changebeavers fell tree for several reason they fell large mature tree usually in strategic location to form the basis of a dam but european beaver tend to use small diameter cm tree for this purpose beaver fell small tree especially young tree for food broadleaved tree a a coppice providing stem and leaf for food in subsequent year pond created by beaver can also kill some tree specie by drowning but this creates standing dead wood which is very important for a wide range of animal and plant dam beaver dam are created a a protection against predator such a coyote wolf and bear and to provide easy access to food during winter beaver always work at night and are prolific builder carrying mud and stone with their and timber between their teeth because of this destroying a beaver dam without removing the beaver is difficult especially if the dam is downstream of an active lodge beaver can rebuild such primary dam overnight though they may not defend secondary dam a vigorously beaver may create a series of dam along a river lodge the pond created by dam help isolate the beaver home which are called lodge these are created from severed branch and mud the beaver cover their lodge late each autumn with fresh mud which freeze when frost arrive the mud becomes almost a hard a stone thereby preventing wolf and wolverine from penetrating the lodge the lodge ha underwater entrance which make entry nearly impossible for any other animal although muskrat have been seen living inside beaver lodge with the beaver who made them only a small amount of the lodge is actually used a a living area beaver dig out their den with underwater entrance after they finish building the dam and lodge structure there are typically two den within the lodge one for drying off after exiting the water and another drier one in which the family life beaver lodge are constructed with the same material a the dam with little order or regularity of structure they seldom house more than four adult and six to eight juvenile some larger lodge have one or more partition but these are only post of the main building left by the builder to support the roof usually the den have no connection with each other except by water when the ice break up in spring beaver usually leave their lodge and roam until just before autumn when they return to their old lodge and gather their winter stock of wood they seldom begin to repair the lodge until the frost set in and rarely finish the outer coating until the cold becomes severe when they erect a new lodge they fell the wood early in summer but seldom begin building until nearly the end of august water quality and beaver beaver pond and the wetland that succeed them remove sediment and pollutant from waterway including total suspended solid total nitrogen phosphate carbon and silicatesthe term beaver fever is a misnomer coined by the american press in the following finding that the parasite giardia lamblia which cause giardiasis is carried by beaver however further research ha shown that many animal and bird carry this parasite and the major source of water contamination is other human norway ha many beaver but ha not historically had giardia and new zealand ha giardia but no beaver recent concern point to domestic animal a a significant vector of giardia with young calf in dairy herd testing a high a positive for giardia in addition fecal coliform and streptococci bacteria excreted into stream by grazing cattle have been shown to be reduced by beaver pond where the bacteria are trapped in bottom sediment urban beaver in north america beaver population in canadian city have seen a resurgence in number in the decade since the decline of the fur trade in approximately beaver live within the city limit of calgary while an estimated beaver live in winnipeg in the same year it wa estimated that several dozen beaver live within the city limit of vancouver toronto doe not keep count of it local beaver population although an estimate from place it local beaver population at several hundredseveral city in the united state have seen the reintroduction of beaver within their city limit for example beaver were trapped to near extirpation and had not been seen in new york city since the early it wa after year that a beaver returned to new york city making it home along the bronx riverin chicago several beaver have returned and made a home near the lincoln park north pond the lincoln park beaver ha not been a well received by the chicago park district and the lincoln park conservancy which wa concerned over damage to tree in the area in march they hired an exterminator to remove a beaver family using live trap and accidentally killed the mother when it got caught in a snare and drownedoutside san francisco in downtown martinez california a male and female beaver arrived in alhambra creek in the martinez beaver built a dam foot wide and at one time six foot high and chewed through half the willow and other creekside landscaping the city planted a part of it million project when the city council wanted to remove the beaver because of fear of flooding local resident organized to protect them forming an organization called worth a dam a an introduced specie in the beaver were brought from northern manitoba in canada to the island of tierra del fuego in southern chile and argentina for commercial fur production however the project failed and the beaver ten pair were released into the wild having no natural predator in their new environment they quickly spread throughout the island and to other island in the region reaching a number of individual within just year they are now considered a serious invasive specie in the region due to their massive destruction of forest tree and effort are being made for their eradication the drastically different ecosystem ha led to substantial environmental damage a the pond created by the beaver have no ecological purpose wetland do not form there a they do in the beaver native territory and there are no native large predator they have also been found to cross salt water to island northward a possible encroachment on the mainland ha naturalist highly concerned in contrast area with introduced beaver were associated with increased population of native puye fish galaxias maculatus whereas the exotic brook trout salvelinus fontinalis and rainbow trout oncorhynchus mykiss had negative effect on native stream fish in the cape horn biosphere reserve chilebeavers are classed a a prohibited new organism under new zealand hazardous substance and new organism act preventing them from legally being imported into the country social behavior family life the basic unit of beaver social organization are family consisting of an adult male and adult female in a monogamous pair and their kit and yearling beaver family can have a many a ten member in addition to the monogamous pair group this size or close to this size build more lodge to live in while smaller family usually need only one however large family in the northern hemisphere have been recorded living in one lodge beaver pair mate for life however if a beaver mate dy it will partner with another one copulation also occur in addition to being monogamous both the male and female take part in raising offspring they also both mark and defend the territory and build and repair the dam and lodge when young are born they spend their first month in the lodge and their mother is the primary caretaker while their father maintains the territory in the time after they leave the lodge for the first time yearling will help their parent build food cache in the fall and repair dam and lodge still adult do the majority of the work and young beaver help their parent for reason based on natural selection rather than kin selection they are dependent on them for food and for learning life skill young beaver spend most of their time playing but also copy their parent behavior however while copying behavior help imprint life skill in young beaver it is not necessarily immediately beneficial for parent a the young beaver do not perform the task a well a the parent older offspring which are around two year old may also live in family and help their parent in addition to helping build food cache and repairing the dam will also help in feeding grooming and guarding younger offspring beaver also practice alloparental care in which an older sibling may take over the parenting duty if the original parent die or are otherwise separated from them this behavior is common and is seen in many other animal specie such a the elephant and fathead minnow while these helping help increase the chance of survival for younger offspring they are not essential for the family and stay and help their family only if there is a shortage of resource in time of food shortage high population density or drought when beaver leave their natal territory they usually do not settle far beaver can recognize their kin by detecting difference in anal gland secretion composition using their keen sense of smell related beaver share more feature in their anal gland secretion profile than unrelated beaver being able to recognize kin is important for beaver social behavior and it cause more tolerant behavior among neighboring beaver territory and spacing beaver maintain and defend territory which are area for feeding nesting and mating they invest much energy in their territory building their dam and becoming familiar with the area beaver mark their territory by constructing scent mount made of mud debris and castoreum a urine based substance excreted through the beaver castor sac between the pelvis and base of the tail these scent mount are established on the border of the territory once a beaver detects another scent in it territory finding the intruder take priority even over food because they invest so much energy in their territory beaver are intolerant of intruder and the holder of the territory is more likely to escalate an aggressive encounter these encounter are often violent to avoid such situation a beaver mark it territory with a many scent mound a possible signaling to intruder that the territory holder ha enough energy to maintain it territory and is thus able to put up a good defense a such territory with more scent mount are avoided more often than one with fewer mount scent marking increase in august during the dispersal of yearling in an attempt to prevent them from intruding on territory beaver also exhibit a behavior known a the dear enemy effect a beaver will investigate and become familiar with the scent of it neighbor a such they respond le aggressively to intrusion by their territorial neighbour than those made by floater or stranger occurrence of beaver aggression towards human have been reported in april an angler near minkovichi in the brest region of belarus died after being bitten twice on the leg by a wild eurasian beaver environmental hazard beaver use their teeth to gnaw at tree and once they fell the tree and shrub they use the wood to build dam these structure flood valley and form lake which then cause permafrost to thaw and release methane in arctic area a this gas is released to the atmosphere climate change ensues the beaver recent migration and habitation in the alaskan tundra is escalating this danger commercial us both beaver testicle and castoreum a secretion with a slightly fetid odor contained in the castor sac of male or female beaver have been article of trade for use in traditional medicine yupik medicine used dried beaver testicle like willow bark to relieve pain dried beaver testicle were also used a contraception beaver testicle were used a medicine in iraq and iran during the tenth to nineteenth century aesop fable describes beaver chewing off their testicle to preserve themselves from hunter which is not possible because the beaver testicle are inside it body this belief also recorded by pliny the elder persisted in medieval bestiarieseuropean beaver castor fiber were eventually hunted nearly to extinction in part for the production of castoreum which wa used a an analgesic and antipyretic castoreum wa described in the british pharmaceutical codex for use in dysmenorrhea and hysterical condition ie pertaining to the womb for raising blood pressure and increasing cardiac output the activity of castoreum ha been credited to the accumulation of salicin from willow tree in the beaver diet which is transformed to salicylic acid and ha an action very similar to aspirin castoreum continues to be used in perfume productioncastoreum can be used a an enhancer of vanilla strawberry and raspberry flavoring it is sometimes added to frozen dairy gelatin candy and fruit beverage due to the difficulty and expense in obtaining castoreum it is very rarely used in common food productsmuch of the early european exploration and trade of canada wa based on the quest for beaver the most valuable part of a beaver is it inner fur whose many minute barb make it excellent for felting especially for hat in canada a made beaver or castor gras that a native had worn or slept on wa more valuable than a fresh skin since this tended to wear off the outer guard hair trapping beaver have been trapped for millennium and this continues to this day beaver pelt were used for barter by native american in the century to gain european good they were then shipped back to great britain and france where they were made into clothing item widespread hunting and trapping of beaver led to their endangerment eventually the fur trade declined due to decreasing demand in europe and the takeover of trapping ground to support the growing agriculture sector a small resurgence in beaver trapping ha occurred in some area where there is an of beaver trapping is done when the fur is of value and the remainder of the animal may be used a feed in the season beaver pelt were harvested in north america in culture in wider culture the beaver is famed for it industriousness and it building skill the english verb to beaver mean to work hard and constantly beverly or beverley a placename found at various location in the world and also commonly used a a first name derives from old english

directed by jordan rubin follows a group of college student on a camping trip that are attacked by a swarm of zombie beaver a an emblem national the importance of the beaver in the development of canada through the fur trade led to it official designation a the national animal in the animal ha long been associated with canada appearing on the coat of arm of the hudson bay company in it is depicted on the canadian piece and wa on the first pictorial postage stamp issued in the canadian colony in the beaver a a national symbol the beaver wa chosen to be the mascot of the summer olympics held in montreal with the name amik beaver in ojibwe the beaver is also the symbol of many unit and organization within the canadian force such a on the cap badge of the royal regiment the calgary highlander the royal westminster regiment and the canadian military engineer toronto police service london police service canadian pacific railway police service and canadian pacific railway bear the beaver on their crest or coat of arm others the beaver is used a a mascot of several college and university often university with heritage in engineering and forestry others who have used the beaver in their company or organizational symbol or a their mascot include in dietary law in the century based on a question raised by the bishop of quebec the roman catholic church ruled that beaver are fish beaver flesh wa a part of the yuko indigenous people diet prior to the european arrival for purpose of dietary law therefore the general prohibition on the consumption of meat on friday did not apply to beaver meat the legal basis for the decision probably rest with the summa theologica of thomas aquinas which base animal classification a much on habit a anatomy this is similar to the church
