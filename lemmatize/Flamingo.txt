flamingo or flamingo are a type of wading bird in the family phoenicopteridae the only bird family in the order phoenicopteriformes four flamingo specie are distributed throughout the america including the caribbean and two specie are native to africa asia and europe etymology the name flamingo come from portuguese or spanish flamengo in turn coming from provencal flamenc from flama flame and suffix with a possible influence of the spanish ethnonym flamenco fleming or flemish the generic name phoenicopterus from greek phoinikopteros phoinikopteros literally mean blood ha a similar etymology to the common name other genus include phoeniconaias which mean water nymph or naiad and phoenicoparrus which mean bird though an unknown bird of omen taxonomy and systematics traditionally the ciconiiformes probably a paraphyletic assemblage have been considered the flamingo closest relative and the family wa included in the order usually the ibis and spoonbill of the threskiornithidae were considered their closest relative within this order earlier genetic study such a those of charles sibley and colleague also supported this relationship relationship to the waterfowl were considered a well especially a flamingo are parasitized by feather louse of the genus anaticola which are otherwise exclusively found on duck and goose the peculiar presbyornithids were used to argue for a close relationship between flamingo waterfowl and wader a paper concluded they are waterfowl but a comprehensive study of bird order found that flamingo and grebe are not waterfowl but rather are part of columbea along with dove sandgrouse and mesites relationship with grebe recent molecular study have suggested a relation with grebe while morphological evidence also strongly support a relationship between flamingo and grebe they hold at least morphological trait in common which are not found in other bird many of these characteristic have been previously identified on flamingo but not on grebe the fossil palaelodids can be considered evolutionarily and ecologically intermediate between flamingo and grebesfor the clade the taxon mirandornithes miraculous bird due to their extreme divergence and apomorphies ha been proposed alternatively they could be placed in one order with phoenocopteriformes taking priority phylogeny living flamingo specie six extant flamingo specie are recognized by most source and were formerly placed in one genus have common characteristic phoenicopterus a a result of a publication the family wa reclassified into two genus currently the family ha three recognized genus according to hbw prehistoric specie of flamingo phoenicopterus floridanus brodkorb early pliocene of florida phoenicopterus stocki miller middle pliocene of rincon mexico

phoenicopterus novaehollandiae late oligocene of south australia description flamingo usually stand on one leg while the other is tucked beneath their body the reason for this behaviour is not fully understood one theory is that standing on one leg allows the bird to conserve more body heat given that they spend a significant amount of time wading in cold water however the behaviour also take place in warm water and is also observed in bird that do not typically stand in water an alternative theory is that standing on one leg reduces the energy expenditure for producing muscular effort to stand and balance on one leg a study on cadaver showed that the pose could be held without any muscle activity while living flamingo demonstrate substantially le body sway in a posture a well a standing in the water flamingo may stamp their webbed foot in the mud to stir up food from the bottomflamingos are capable flyer and flamingo in captivity often require wing clipping to prevent escape a pair of african flamingo which had not yet had their wing clipped escaped from the wichita kansa zoo in one wa spotted in texas year later it had been seen previously by birder in texas wisconsin and louisiana young flamingo hatch with plumage but adult range from light pink to bright red due to aqueous bacteria and obtained from their food supply a healthy flamingo is more vibrantly colored thus a more desirable mate a white or pale flamingo however is usually unhealthy or malnourished captive flamingo are a notable exception they may turn a pale pink if they are not fed carotene at level comparable to the wildthe greater flamingo is the tallest of the six different specie of flamingo standing at to foot to m with a weight up to pound kg and the shortest flamingo specie the lesser ha a height of foot m and weighs pound kg flamingo can have a wingspan a small a inch cm to a big a inch cm flamingo can open their bill by raising the upper jaw a well a by dropping the lower behavior and ecology feeding flamingo on brine shrimp and algae a well a insect larva small insect mollusk and crustacean making them omnivore their bill are specially adapted to separate mud and silt from the food they eat and are uniquely used the filtering of food item is assisted by hairy structure called lamella which line the mandible and the large tongue the pink or reddish color of flamingo come from carotenoid in their diet of animal and plant plankton american flamingo are a brighter red color because of the beta carotene availability in their food while the lesser flamingo are a paler pink due to ingesting a smaller amount of this pigment these carotenoid are broken down into pigment by liver enzyme the source of this varies by specie and affect the color saturation flamingo whose sole diet is algae are darker than those that get it by eating animal that have digested algae lifecycle flamingo are very social bird they live in colony whose population can number in the thousand these large colony are believed to serve three purpose for the flamingo avoiding predator maximizing food intake and using scarcely suitable nesting site more efficiently before breeding flamingo colony split into breeding group of about to bird both male and female in these group perform synchronized ritual display the member of a group stand together and display to each other by stretching their neck upwards then uttering call while and then flapping their wing the display do not seem directed towards an individual but occur randomly these display stimulate synchronous nesting see below and help pair up those bird that do not already have matesflamingos form strong pair bond although in larger colony flamingo sometimes change mate presumably because more mate are available to choose flamingo pair establish and defend nesting territory they locate a suitable spot on the mudflat to build a nest the female usually selects the place copulation usually occurs during nest building which is sometimes interrupted by another flamingo pair trying to commandeer the nesting site for their use flamingo aggressively defend their nesting site both the male and the female contribute to building the nest and to protecting the nest and egg pair have been reportedafter the chick hatch the only parental expense is feeding both the male and the female feed their chick with a kind of crop milk produced in gland lining the whole of the upper digestive tract not just the crop the hormone prolactin stimulates production the milk contains fat protein and red and white blood cell pigeon and produce crop milk just in the gland lining the crop which contains le fat and more protein than flamingo crop milk for the first six day after the chick hatch the adult and chick stay in the nesting site at around day old the chick begin to move out of their nest and explore their surroundings when they are two week old the chick congregate in group called microcreches and their parent leave them alone after a while the microcreches merge into creche containing thousand of chick chick that do not stay in their creche are vulnerable to predator status and conservation in captivity the first flamingo hatched in a european zoo wa a chilean flamingo at zoo basel in switzerland in since then over flamingo have grown up in basel and been distributed to other zoo around the globegreater an at least greater flamingo believed to be the oldest in the world died at the adelaide zoo in australia in january have used mirror to improve flamingo breeding behaviour the mirror are thought to give the flamingo the impression that they are in a larger flock than they actually are relationship with human ancient roman considered their tongue a delicacy in the america the moche people of ancient peru worshipped nature they placed emphasis on animal and often depicted flamingo in their art flamingo are the national bird of the bahamas andean miner have killed flamingo for their fat believing that it would cure tuberculosis in the united state pink plastic flamingo statue are popular lawn ornament reference external link flamingo resource centre flamingo video and photo on the internet
