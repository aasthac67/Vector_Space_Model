the wildebeest plural wildebeest or wildebeest also called the gnu new or noo is an antelope in the genus connochaetes it belongs to the family bovidae which includes antelope cattle goat sheep and other horned ungulate connochaetes includes two specie both native to africa the black wildebeest or gnu c gnou and the blue wildebeest or brindled gnu c taurinus fossil record suggest these two specie diverged about one million year ago resulting in a northern and a southern specie the blue wildebeest remained in it original range and changed very little from the ancestral specie while the black wildebeest changed more a adaptation to it open grassland habitat in the south the most obvious way of telling the two specie apart are the difference in their colouring and in the way their horn are orientedin east africa the blue wildebeest is the most abundant specie some population perform an annual migration to new grazing ground but the black wildebeest is merely nomadic breeding in both take place over a short period of time at the end of the rainy season and the calf are soon active and are able to move with the herd a fact necessary for their survival nevertheless some fall prey to large carnivore especially the spotted hyena wildebeest often graze in mixed herd with zebra which give heightened awareness of potential predator they are also alert to the warning signal emitted by other animal such a baboon wildebeest are a tourist attraction but compete with domesticated livestock for pasture and are sometimes blamed by farmer for transferring disease and parasite to their cattle some illegal hunting go on but the population trend is fairly stable and some population are in national park or on private land the international union for conservation of nature list both a specie etymology wildebeest is dutch for wild beast or wild cattle in afrikaans bee cattle while connochaetes derives from the greek word konnos konnos beard and khaite khaite flowing hair mane some source claim the name gnu originates from the khoikhoi name for these animal others contend the name and it pronunciation in english go back to the word nu used for the black wildebeest by the san people classification taxonomy and evolution the wildebeest genus connochaetes is placed under the family bovidae and subfamily alcelaphinae where it closest relative are the hartebeest alcelaphus spp the hirola beatragus hunteri and specie in the genus damaliscus such a the topi the tsessebe the blesbok and the bontebok the name connochaetes wa given by german zoologist hinrich lichtenstein in settler first discovered wildebeest in about on their way to the interior of south africa due to their resemblance to wild cattle these people called them wild ox or wildebeest the blue wildebeest wa first known to westerner in the northern part of south africa a century later in the the early century one specie of the wildebeest c albojubatus wa identified in eastern africa in two separate race of the wildebeest were introduced namely gorgon a albojubatus athi wildebeest and g a mearnsi loita wildebeest however in the two were once again merged into a single race connochaetes taurinus albojubatus in the century two separate form were recognised gorgon taurinus hecki and g t albojubatus finally two distinct type of wildebeest the blue and black wildebeest were identified the blue wildebeest wa at first placed under a separate genus gorgon while the black wildebeest belonged to the genus connochaetes today they are united in the single genus connochaetes with the black wildebeest being named c gnou and the blue wildebeest c taurinus according to a mitochondrial dna analysis the black wildebeest are estimated to have diverged from the main lineage during the middle pleistocene and became a distinct specie around a million year ago a divergence rate around ha been calculated the split doe not seem to have been driven by competition for resource but instead because each specie adopted a different ecological niche and occupied a different trophic levelblue wildebeest fossil dating back some million year ago are common and widespread they have been found in the cave at the cradle of humankind north of johannesburg elsewhere in south africa they are plentiful at such site a elandsfontein cornelia and florisbad the earliest fossil of the black wildebeest were found in sedimentary rock in cornelia in the orange free state and dated back about year today five subspecies of the blue wildebeest are recognised while the black wildebeest ha no named subspecies genetics and hybrid the diploid number of chromosome in the wildebeest is chromosome were studied in a male and a female wildebeest in the female all except a pair of very large submetacentric chromosome were found to be acrocentric metaphase were studied in the male chromosome and very large submetacentric chromosome were found there a well similar to those in the female both in size and morphology other chromosome were acrocentric the x chromosome is a large acrocentric and the y chromosome a minute onethe two specie of the wildebeest are known to hybridise male black wildebeest have been reported to mate with female blue wildebeest and vice versa the difference in social behaviour and habitat have historically prevented interspecific hybridisation between the specie but hybridisation may occur when they are both confined within the same area the resulting offspring are usually fertile a study of these hybrid animal at spioenkop dam nature reserve in south africa revealed that many had disadvantageous abnormality relating to their teeth horn and the wormian bone in the skull another study reported an increase in the size of the hybrid a compared to either of it parent in some animal the tympanic part of the temporal bone is highly deformed and in others the radius and ulna are fused characteristic of the specie both specie of wildebeest are horned ungulate resembling cattle male are larger than female and both have heavy forequarter compared to their hindquarter they have broad muzzle roman nose and shaggy mane and tail the most striking morphological difference between the black and blue wildebeest are the orientation and curvature of their horn and the colour of their coat the blue wildebeest is the bigger of the two specie in male blue wildebeest stand cm tall at the shoulder and weigh around kg while the black wildebeest stand to cm tall and weighs about kg in female blue wildebeest have a shoulder height of cm and weigh kg while black wildebeest female stand cm at the shoulder and weigh kg the horn of blue wildebeest protrude to the side then curve downwards before curving up back towards the skull while the horn of the black wildebeest curve forward then downward before curving upwards at the tip blue wildebeest tend to be a dark grey colour with stripe but may have a bluish sheen the black wildebeest ha hair with a mane that range in colour from cream to black and a tail the blue wildebeest life in a wide variety of habitat including woodland and grassland while the black wildebeest tends to reside exclusively in open grassland area in some area the blue wildebeest migrates over long distance in the winter whereas the black wildebeest doe not the milk of the female black wildebeest contains a higher protein lower fat and lower lactose content than the milk of the blue wildebeest wildebeest can live more than year though their average lifespan is around year distribution and habitat wildebeest inhabit the plain and open woodland of part of africa south of the sahara the black wildebeest is native to the southernmost part of the continent it historical range included south africa eswatini and lesotho but in the latter two country it wa hunted to extinction in the century it ha now been reintroduced to them and also introduced to namibia where it ha become well established it inhabits open plain grassland and karoo shrublands in both steep mountainous region and lower undulating hill at altitude varying between and m and ft in the past it inhabited the highveld temperate grassland during the dry winter season and the arid karoo region during the rain however a a result of widespread hunting the black wildebeest no longer occupies it historical range or make migration and is now largely limited to game farm and protected reservesthe blue wildebeest is native to eastern and southern africa it range includes kenya tanzania botswana zambia zimbabwe mozambique south africa swaziland and angola it is no longer found in malawi but ha been successfully reintroduced into namibia blue wildebeest are mainly found in short grass plain bordering acacia savanna thriving in area that are neither too wet nor too dry they can be found in habitat that vary from overgrazed area with dense bush to open woodland floodplain in east africa the blue wildebeest is the most abundant big game specie both in population and biomass it is a notable feature of the serengeti national park in tanzania the maasai mara national reserve in kenya and the liuwa plain national park in zambia migration not all wildebeest are migratory black wildebeest herd are often nomadic or may have a regular home range of sq mi bull may occupy territory usually about to m to ft apart but this spacing varies according to the quality of the habitat in favourable condition they may be a close a m ft or they may be a far apart a m ft in poor habitat female herd have home range of about acre ha sq mi in size herd of nonterritorial bachelor male roam at will and do not seem to have any restriction on where they wanderblue wildebeest have both migratory and sedentary population in the ngorongoro most animal are sedentary and male maintain a network of territory throughout the year though breeding is seasonal in nature female and young form group of about individual or join together in larger aggregation and nonterritorial male form bachelor group in the serengeti and tarangire ecosystem population are mostly migratory with herd consisting of both sex frequently moving but resident subpopulation also exist during the rutting season the male may form temporary territory for a few hour or a day or so and attempt to gather together a few female with which to mate but soon they have to move on often moving ahead to set up another temporary territoryin the maasai mara game reserve a population of blue wildebeest had dwindled from about animal in to about in the reason for the decline is thought to be the increasing competition between cattle and wildebeest for a diminishing area of grazing land a a result of change in agricultural practice and possibly fluctuation in rainfalleach year some east african population of blue wildebeest have a migration seemingly timed to coincide with the annual pattern of rainfall and grass growth the timing of their migration in both the rainy and dry season can vary considerably by month from year to year at the end of the wet season may or june in east africa wildebeest migrate to area in response to a lack of surface drinking water when the rainy season begin again month later animal quickly move back to their range factor suspected to affect migration include food abundance surface water availability predator and phosphorus content in grass phosphorus is a crucial element for all life form particularly for lactating female bovid a a result during the rainy season wildebeest select grazing area that contain particularly high phosphorus level one study found in addition to phosphorus wildebeest select range containing grass with relatively high nitrogen contentaerial photography ha revealed that a level of organisation occurs in the movement of the herd that can not be apparent to each individual animal for example the migratory herd exhibit a wavy front and this suggests that some degree of local is taking place numerous documentary feature wildebeest crossing river with many being eaten by crocodile or drowning in the attempt while having the appearance of a frenzy recent research ha shown a herd of wildebeest posse what is known a a swarm intelligence whereby the animal systematically explore and overcome the obstacle a one ecology predator major predator that feed on wildebeest include the lion hyena african wild dog cheetah leopard and crocodile which seem to favour the wildebeest over other prey wildebeest however are very strong and can inflict considerable injury even to a lion wildebeest have a maximum running speed of around mph the primary defensive tactic is herding where the young animal are protected by the older larger one while the herd run a a group typically the predator attempt to isolate a young or ill animal and attack without having to worry about the herd wildebeest have developed additional sophisticated cooperative behaviour such a animal taking turn sleeping while others stand guard against a night attack by invading predator wildebeest migration are closely followed by vulture a wildebeest carcass are an important source of food for these scavenger the vulture consume about of the wildebeest carcass available decrease in the number of migrating wildebeest have also had a negative effect on the vulture in the serengeti ecosystem tanzania wildebeest may help facilitate the migration of other grazers such a thomson gazelle eudorcas thomsonii which eat the grass stimulated by wildebeest foraging interaction with nonpredators zebra and wildebeest group together in open savannah environment with high chance of predation this grouping strategy reduces predation risk because larger group decrease each individual chance of being hunted and predator are more easily seen in open area the seasonal presence of thousand of migratory wildebeest reduces local lion predation on giraffe calf resulting in greater survival of giraffeswildebeest can also listen in on the alarm call of other specie and by doing so can reduce their risk of predation one study showed along with other ungulate wildebeest responded more strongly to the baboon alarm call compared to the baboon contest call though both type of call had similar pattern amplitude and duration the alarm call were a response of the baboon to lion and the contest call were recorded when a dispute between two male occurred breeding and reproduction wildebeest do not form permanent pair bond and during the mating season or rut the male establish temporary territory and try to attract female into them these small territory are about square metre sq ft acre with up to territory per square kilometre sq mi acre the male defend these territory from other male while competing for female that are coming into oestrus the male use grunt and distinctive behaviour to entice female into their territory wildebeest usually breed at the end of the rainy season when the animal are well fed and at their peak of fitness this usually occurs between may and july and birthing usually take place between january and march at the start of the wet season wildebeest female breed seasonally and ovulate spontaneouslythe estrous cycle is about day and the gestation period last to day the calf weigh about kg lb at birth and scramble to their foot within minute being able to move with the herd soon afterwards a fact on which their survival relies the main predator of the calf is the spotted hyena the calving peak period last for week and in small subpopulation and isolated group mortality of calf may be a high a however in larger aggregation or small group living near large herd survival rate may be over group of wildebeest female and young live in the small area established by the male when group of wildebeest join together the female to male ratio is higher because the female choose to move to the area held by a smaller number of male this sex ratio may be due to illegal hunting and human disturbance with higher male mortality having been attributed to hunting threat and conservation today many wildebeest population are experiencing rapid decline overland migration a a biological process requires large connected landscape which are increasingly difficult to maintain particularly over the long term when human demand on the landscape compete the most acute threat come from migration barrier such a fence and road in one of the more striking example of the consequence of on terrestrial migration botswanan authority placed thousand of kilometre of fence across the kalahari that prevented wildebeest from reaching watering hole and grazing ground resulting in the death of ten of thousand of individual reducing the wildebeest population to le than of it previous size illegal hunting is a major conservation concern in many area along with natural threat posed by main predator which include lion leopard african hunting dog cheetah and hyena where the black and blue wildebeest share a common range the two can hybridise and this is regarded a a potential threat to the black wildebeestthe black wildebeest ha been classified a a specie by the international union for conservation of nature in the iucn red list the population of this specie are on an increase now more than individual are believed to remain of which are in namibia outside their natural range and where it is farmed around of the wildebeest occurs in private area while the other is confined in protected area it introduction into namibia ha been a success and number have increased substantially there from in to in the blue wildebeest ha also been rated a of least concern the population trend is stable and their number are estimated to be around mainly due to the increase of the population in serengeti national park tanzania to however the number of one of the subspecies the eastern wildebeest c t albojubatus have seen a steep decline population density range from in hwange and etosha national park to in ngorongoro conservation area and serengeti national park us and interaction with human wildebeest provide several useful animal product the hide make leather and the flesh is coarse dry and rather hard wildebeest are killed for food especially to make biltong in southern africa this dried game meat is a delicacy and an important food item in africa the meat of female is more tender than that of male and is the most tender during the autumn season wildebeest are a regular target for illegal meat hunter because their number make them easy to find cook preparing the wildebeest carcass usually cut it into piece the estimated price for wildebeest meat wa about u per kilogram lb around the silky flowing tail of the black wildebeest is used to make or chowrieswildebeest benefit the ecosystem by increasing soil fertility with their excreta they are economically important for human being a they are a major tourist attraction they also provide important product such a leather to human wildebeest however can also have a negative impact on human wild individual can be competitor of commercial livestock and can transmit disease and cause epidemic among animal particularly domestic cattle they can also spread tick lungworms tapeworm fly and paramphistome fluke cultural depiction the wildebeest is depicted on the coat of arm of the province of natal and later in south africa over the year the south african authority have issued several stamp displaying the animal and the south african mint ha struck a two cent piece with a prancing black wildebeestmovies and television show also feature wildebeest including khumba mama v the wild kazar and his minion all hail king julien vigman wildebeest phineas and ferb newton the gnu the great space coaster newscaster gary gnu and the lion king the wildebeest stampede that resulted in mufasa death michael flanders wrote a humorous song called the gnu which wa very popular when he performed it with donald swann in a revue called at the drop of a hat which opened in london on december in the british tea brand typhoo ran a series of television advertisement featuring an animated
