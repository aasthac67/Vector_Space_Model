the cheetah acinonyx jubatus is a large cat native to africa and central iran it is the fastest land animal capable of running at to to mph and a such ha several adaptation for speed including a light build long thin leg and a long tail cheetah typically reach cm in at the shoulder and the length is between and m and ft adult typically weigh between and kg and lb it head is small rounded and ha a short snout and black facial streak the coat is typically tawny to creamy white or pale buff and is mostly covered with evenly spaced solid black spot four subspecies are recognised more gregarious than many other cat the cheetah ha three main social and their cub male coalition and solitary male while female lead a nomadic life searching for prey in large home range male are more sedentary and may instead establish much smaller territory in area with plentiful prey and access to female the cheetah is active mainly during the day and hunting is it major preoccupation with peak during dawn and dusk it feed on to prey mostly weighing under kg lb and prefers ungulate such a impala springbok and thomson gazelle the cheetah will typically stalk it prey to within m ft charge towards it trip it during the chase and bite it throat to suffocate it to death breeding occurs throughout the year after a gestation of nearly three month a litter of typically three to five cub is born cheetah cub are highly vulnerable to predation by other large carnivore such a hyena and lion weaning happens at around four month and cub are independent by around month of age the cheetah occurs in a variety of habitat such a savannah in the serengeti arid mountain range in the sahara and hilly desert terrain in iran the cheetah is threatened by several factor such a habitat loss conflict with human poaching and high susceptibility to disease earlier ranging throughout most of africa and extending eastward into the middle east up to the indian subcontinent the cheetah is now distributed mainly in small fragmented population in central iran and southern eastern and northwestern africa in the global cheetah population wa estimated at around individual in the wild it is listed a vulnerable on the iucn red list in the past cheetah used to be tamed and trained for hunting ungulate they have been widely depicted in art literature advertising and animation etymology the vernacular name cheetah is derived from hindustani which today is split into hindi cita and urdu chita which in turn come from sanskrit citra meaning variegated adorned or painted in the past cheetah were often called hunting leopard because they could be tamed and used a hunting companion the generic name acinonyx probably derives from the combination of two greek word akinetos akinitos meaning unmoved or motionless and onux onyx meaning nail or hoof a rough translation would be immobile nail a reference to the cheetah limited ability to retract it claw a similar meaning can be obtained by the combination of the greek prefix implying a lack of and kineo kineo meaning to move or set in motion a few old generic name such a cynailurus and cynofelis allude to the similarity between the cheetah and canid the specific name jubatus is latin for crested in reference to the long hair on the nape taxonomy in johann christian daniel von schreber described the cheetah based on a skin from the cape of good hope and gave it the scientific name felis jubatus joshua brooke proposed the generic name acinonyx in in reginald innes pocock placed the cheetah in a subfamily of it own acinonychinae given it striking morphological resemblance to the greyhound a well a significant deviation from typical felid feature the cheetah wa classified in felinae in later taxonomic revisionsin the and century several cheetah specimen were described some were proposed a subspecies an example is the south african specimen known a the woolly cheetah named for it notably dense wa described a a new specie felis lanea by philip sclater in but the classification wa mostly disputed there ha been considerable confusion in the nomenclature of cheetah and leopard panthera pardus a author often confused the two some considered hunting leopard an independent specie or equal to the leopard subspecies in five subspecies were considered valid taxon a j hecki a j jubatus a j raineyi a j soemmeringii and a j venaticus in a phylogeographic study found minimal genetic variation between a j jubatus and a j raineyi only four subspecies were identified in the cat classification task force of the iucn cat specialist group revised felid taxonomy and recognised these four subspecies a valid their detail are tabulated below phylogeny and evolution the cheetah closest relative are the cougar puma concolor and the jaguarundi herpailurus yagouaroundi together these three specie form the puma lineage one of the eight lineage of the extant felid the puma lineage diverged from the rest mya the sister group of the puma lineage is a clade of smaller old world cat that includes the genus felis otocolobus and prionailurusthe oldest cheetah fossil excavated in eastern and southern africa date to mya the earliest known specimen from south africa is from the lowermost deposit of the silderberg grotto sterkfontein though incomplete these fossil indicate form larger but le cursorial than the modern cheetah fossil remains from europe are limited to a few middle pleistocene specimen from hundsheim austria and mosbach sand germany cat are known from a late a year ago from the old world the giant cheetah a pardinensis significantly larger and slower compared to the modern cheetah occurred in eurasia and eastern and southern africa in the villafranchian period roughly mya in the middle pleistocene a smaller cheetah a intermedius ranged from europe to china the modern cheetah appeared in africa around mya it fossil record is restricted to africaextinct north american cat had historically been classified in felis puma or acinonyx two such specie f studeri and f trumani were considered to be closer to the puma than the cheetah despite their close similarity to the latter noting this palaeontologist daniel adam proposed miracinonyx a new subgenus under acinonyx in for the north american cat this wa later elevated to genus rank adam pointed out that north american and old world cat may have had a common ancestor and acinonyx might have originated in north america instead of eurasia however subsequent research ha shown that miracinonyx is phylogenetically closer to the cougar than the cheetah the similarity to cheetah have been attributed to convergent evolutionthe three specie of the puma lineage may have had a common ancestor during the miocene roughly mya some suggest that north american cheetah possibly migrated to asia via the bering strait then dispersed southward to africa through eurasia at least year ago some author have expressed doubt over the occurrence of cat in north america and instead suppose the modern cheetah to have evolved from asian population that eventually spread to africa the cheetah is thought to have experienced two population bottleneck that greatly decreased the genetic variability in population one occurred about year ago that ha been correlated to migration from north america to asia and the second year ago in africa possibly a part of the late pleistocene extinction event genetics the diploid number of chromosome in the cheetah is the same a in most other felid the cheetah wa the first felid observed to have unusually low genetic variability among individual which ha led to poor breeding in captivity increased spermatozoal defect high juvenile mortality and increased susceptibility to disease and infection a prominent instance wa the deadly feline coronavirus outbreak in a cheetah breeding facility of oregon in which had a mortality rate of than that recorded for previous epizootics of feline infectious peritonitis in any felid the remarkable homogeneity in cheetah gene ha been demonstrated by experiment involving the major histocompatibility complex mhc unless the mhc gene are highly homogeneous in a population skin graft exchanged between a pair of unrelated individual would be rejected skin graft exchanged between unrelated cheetah are accepted well and heal a if their genetic makeup were the same king cheetah the king cheetah is a variety of cheetah with a rare mutation for fur marked with large blotchy spot and three dark wide stripe extending from the neck to the tail native knew the animal a nsuifisi believing it to be a cross between a leopard and a hyena in major a cooper wrote about a animal he had shot near harare with fur a thick a that of a snow leopard and spot that merged to form stripe he suggested it could be a cross between a leopard and a cheetah a more such individual were observed it wa seen that they had claw like the cheetahin pocock described these individual a a new specie by the name of acinonyx rex king cheetah however in the absence of proof to support his claim he withdrew his proposal in abel chapman considered it a colour morph of the normally spotted cheetah since the king cheetah ha been reported five more time in the wild in zimbabwe botswana and northern transvaal one wa photographed in two female cheetah that had mated with a wild male from transvaal at the de wildt cheetah and wildlife centre south africa gave birth to one king cheetah each subsequently more king cheetah were born at the centre in the cause of this coat pattern wa found to be a mutation in the gene for transmembrane aminopeptidase taqpep the same gene responsible for the striped mackerel versus blotchy classic pattern seen in tabby cat the appearance is caused by reinforcement of a recessive allele hence if two mating cheetah carry the mutated allele a quarter of their offspring can be expected to be king cheetah characteristic the cheetah is a lightly built spotted cat characterised by a small rounded head a short snout black facial streak a deep chest long thin leg and a long tail it slender form is highly adapted for speed and contrast sharply with the robust build of the big cat genus panthera cheetah typically reach cm in at the shoulder and the length is between and m and ft the weight can vary with age health location sex and subspecies adult typically range between and kg and lb cub born in the wild weigh g oz at birth while those born in captivity tend to be larger and weigh around g oz cheetah are sexually dimorphic with male larger and heavier than female but not to the extent seen in other large cat study differ significantly on morphological variation among the subspeciesthe coat is typically tawny to creamy white or pale buff darker in the portion the chin throat and underpart of the leg and the belly are white and devoid of marking the rest of the body is covered with around evenly spaced oval or round solid black spot each measuring roughly cm in each cheetah ha a distinct pattern of spot which can be used to identify unique individual besides the clearly visible spot there are other faint irregular black mark on the coat newly born cub are covered in fur with an unclear pattern of spot that give them a dark white above and nearly black on the underside the hair is mostly short and often coarse but the chest and the belly are covered in soft fur the fur of king cheetah ha been reported to be silky there is a short rough mane covering at least cm in along the neck and the shoulder this feature is more prominent in male the mane start out a a cape of long loose blue to grey hair in juvenile melanistic cheetah are rare and have been seen in zambia and zimbabwe in sclater described two partially albino specimen from south africa the head is small and more rounded compared to the big cat saharan cheetah have slim face the ear are small short and rounded they are tawny at the base and on the edge and marked with black patch on the back the eye are set high and have round pupil the whisker shorter and fewer than those of other felid are fine and inconspicuous the pronounced tear streak or malar stripe unique to the cheetah originate from the corner of the eye and run down the nose to the mouth the role of these streak is not well may protect the eye from the sun glare a helpful feature a the cheetah hunt mainly during the day or they could be used to define facial expression the exceptionally long and muscular tail with a bushy white tuft at the end measure cm in while the first of the tail are covered in spot the final third is marked with four to six dark ring or stripesthe cheetah is superficially similar to the leopard but the leopard ha rosette instead of spot and lack tear streak moreover the cheetah is slightly taller than the leopard the serval resembles the cheetah in physical build but is significantly smaller ha a shorter tail and it spot fuse to form stripe on the back the cheetah appears to have evolved convergently with canid in morphology a well a behaviour it ha feature such a a relatively long snout long leg a deep chest tough paw pad and blunt claw the cheetah ha often been likened to the greyhound a both have similar morphology and the ability to reach tremendous speed in a shorter time than other mammal but the cheetah can attain higher maximum speed internal anatomy sharply contrasting with the big cat in it morphology the cheetah show several adaptation for prolonged chase to catch prey at some of the fastest recorded speed it light streamlined body make it to short explosive burst of speed rapid acceleration and an ability to execute extreme change in direction while moving at high speed the large nasal passage accommodated well due to the smaller size of the canine teeth ensure fast flow of sufficient air and the enlarged heart and lung allow the enrichment of blood with oxygen in a short time this allows cheetah to rapidly regain their stamen after a chase during a typical chase their respiratory rate increase from to breath per minute moreover the reduced viscosity of the blood at higher temperature common in frequently moving muscle could ease blood flow and increase oxygen transport while running in addition to having good traction due to their claw cheetah use their tail a a mean of steering that enables them to make sharp turn necessary to outflank antelope which often change direction to escape during a chase the protracted claw increase grip over the ground while paw pad make the sprint more convenient over tough ground the limb of the cheetah are longer than what is typical for other cat it size the thigh muscle are large and the tibia and fibula are held close together making the lower leg le likely to rotate this reduces the risk of losing balance during run but compromise the ability to climb the highly reduced clavicle is connected through ligament to the scapula whose motion increase the stride length and assist in shock absorption the extension of the vertebral column can add a much a cm in to the stride length the cheetah resembles the smaller cat in cranial feature and in having a long and flexible spine a opposed to the stiff and short one in other large felid the roughly triangular skull ha light narrow bone and the sagittal crest is poorly developed possibly to reduce weight and enhance speed the mouth can not be opened a widely a in other cat given the shorter length of muscle between the jaw and the skull a study suggested that the limited retraction of the cheetah claw may result from the earlier truncation of the development of the middle phalanx bone in cheetahsthe cheetah ha a total of teeth the dental formula is the sharp narrow carnassials are larger than those of leopard and lion suggesting the cheetah can consume larger amount of food in a given time period the small flat canine are used to bite the throat and suffocate the prey a study gave the bite force quotient bfq of the cheetah a close to that for the lion suggesting that adaptation for a lighter skull may not have reduced the power of the cheetah bite unlike other cat the cheetah canine have no gap behind them when the jaw close a the top and bottom cheek teeth show extensive overlap this equips the upper and lower teeth to effectively tear through the meat the slightly curved claw shorter a well a straighter than those of other cat lack a protective sheath and are partly retractable the claw are blunt due to lack of protection but the large and strongly curved dewclaw is remarkably sharp cheetah have a high concentration of nerve cell arranged in a band in the centre of the eye a visual streak the most efficient among felid this significantly sharpens the vision and enables the cheetah to swiftly locate prey against the horizon the cheetah is unable to roar due to the presence of a vocal fold within the larynx speed and acceleration the cheetah is the fastest land animal estimate of the maximum speed attained range from to to mph a commonly quoted value is mph recorded in but this measurement is disputed in an cheetah named sarah from the cincinnati zoo set a world record by running m ft in second over a set run recording a maximum speed of mph contrary to the common belief that cheetah hunt by simply chasing it prey at high speed the finding of two study in observing hunting cheetah using gps collar show that cheetah hunt at speed much lower than the highest recorded for them during most of the chase interspersed with a few short burst lasting only second when they attain peak speed in one of the study the average speed recorded during the high speed phase wa mph or within the range mph including error the highest recorded value wa mph the researcher suggested that a hunt consists of two initial fast acceleration phase when the cheetah try to catch up with the prey followed by slowing down a it close in on it the deceleration varying by the prey in question the peak acceleration observed wa m ft per square second while the peak deceleration value wa m ft per square second speed and acceleration value for a hunting cheetah may be different from those for a because while engaged in the chase the cheetah is more likely to be twisting and turning and may be running through vegetation the speed attained by the cheetah may be only slightly greater than those achieved by the pronghorn at mph and the springbok at mph but the cheetah additionally ha an exceptional accelerationone stride of a galloping cheetah measure to m to ft the stride length and the number of jump increase with speed during more than half the duration of the sprint the cheetah ha all four limb in the air increasing the stride length running cheetah can retain up to of the heat generated during the chase a study suggested the length of the sprint is limited by excessive of body heat when the body temperature reach however a study recorded the average temperature of cheetah after hunt to be suggesting high temperature need not cause hunt to be abandoned ecology and behaviour cheetah are active mainly during the day whereas other carnivore such a leopard and lion are active mainly at night these larger carnivore can kill cheetah and steal their kill hence the diurnal tendency of cheetah help them avoid larger predator in area where they are sympatric such a the okavango delta in area where the cheetah is the major predator such a farmland in botswana and namibia activity tends to increase at night this may also happen in highly arid region such a the sahara where daytime temperature can reach the lunar cycle can also influence the cheetah might increase on moonlit night a prey can be sighted easily though this come with the danger of encountering larger predator hunting is the major activity throughout the day with peak during dawn and dusk group rest in grassy clearing after dusk cheetah often inspect their vicinity at observation point such a elevation to check for prey or larger carnivore even while resting they take turn at keeping a lookout social organisation cheetah have a flexible and complex social structure and tend to be more gregarious than several other cat except the lion individual typically avoid one another but are generally amicable male may fight over territory or access to female in oestrus and on rare occasion such fight can result in severe injury and death female are not social and have minimal interaction with other individual barring the interaction with male when they enter their territory or during the mating season some female generally mother and offspring or sibling may rest beside one another during the day female tend to lead a solitary life or live with offspring in undefended home range young female often stay close to their mother for life but young male leave their mother range to live elsewheresome male are territorial and group together for life forming coalition that collectively defend a territory which ensures maximum access to is unlike the behaviour of the male lion who mate with a particular group pride of female in most case a coalition will consist of brother born in the same litter who stayed together after weaning but biologically unrelated male are often allowed into the group in the serengeti member in coalition are unrelated male male in a coalition are affectionate toward each other grooming mutually and calling out if any member is lost unrelated male may face some aversion in their initial day in the group all male in the coalition typically have equal access to kill when the group hunt together and possibly also to female who may enter their territory if a cub is the only male in a litter he will typically join an existing group or form a small group of solitary male with two or three other lone male who may or may not be territorial in the kalahari desert around of the male live in solitude a coalition generally ha a greater chance of encountering and acquiring female for mating however it large membership demand greater resource than do solitary male a study showed that solitary and grouped male have a nearly equal chance of coming across female but the male in coalition are notably healthier and have better chance of survival than their solitary counterpart home range and territory unlike many other felid among cheetah female tend to occupy larger area compared to male female typically disperse over large area in pursuit of prey but they are le nomadic and roam in a smaller area if prey availability in the area is high a such the size of their home range depends on the distribution of prey in a region in central namibia where most prey specie are sparsely distributed home range average sq mi whereas in the woodland of the phinda game reserve south africa which have plentiful prey home range are sq mi in size cheetah can travel long stretch overland in search of food a study in the kalahari desert recorded an average displacement of nearly km mi every day and walking speed ranged between and and mph male are generally le nomadic than female often male in coalition and sometimes solitary male staying far from coalition establish territory whether male settle in territory or disperse over large area forming home range depends primarily on the movement of female territoriality is preferred only if female tend to be more sedentary which is more feasible in area with plenty of prey some male called floater switch between territoriality and nomadism depending on the availability of female a study showed territoriality depended on the size and age of male and the membership of the coalition the range of floater averaged sq mi in the serengeti to sq mi in central namibia in the kruger national park south africa territory were much smaller a coalition of three male occupied a territory measuring sq mi and the territory of a solitary male measured sq mi when a female enters a territory the male will surround her if she try to escape the male will bite or snap at her generally the female can not escape on her own the male themselves leave after they lose interest in her they may smell the spot she wa sitting or lying on to determine if she wa in oestrus communication the cheetah is a vocal felid with a broad repertoire of call and sound the acoustic feature and the use of many of these have been studied in detail the vocal characteristic such a the way they are produced are often different from those of other cat for instance a study showed that exhalation is louder than inhalation in cheetah while no such distinction wa observed in the domestic cat listed below are some commonly recorded vocalisation observed in cheetah chirping a chirp or a is an intense call and last le than a second cheetah chirp when they are excited for instance when gathered around a kill other us include summoning concealed or lost cub by the mother or a a greeting or courtship between adult the cheetah chirp is similar to the soft roar of the lion and it churr a the latter loud roar a similar but louder call can be heard from up to km mi away this call is typically used by mother to locate lost cub or by cub to find their mother and sibling churring or churtling a churr is a shrill staccato call that can last up to two second churring and chirping have been noted for their similarity to the soft and loud roar of the lion it is produced in similar context a chirping but a study of feeding cheetah found chirping to be much more common purring similar to purring in domestic cat but much louder it is produced when the cheetah is content and a a form of greeting or when licking one another it involves continuous sound production alternating between egressive and ingressive airstream agonistic sound these include bleating coughing growling hissing meowing and moaning or yowling a bleat indicates distress for instance when a cheetah confronts a predator that ha stolen it kill growl hiss and moan are accompanied by multiple strong hit on the ground with the front paw during which the cheetah may retreat by a few metre a meow though a versatile call is typically associated with discomfort or irritation other vocalisation individual can make a gurgling noise a part of a close amicable interaction a nyam nyam sound may be produced while eating apart from chirping mother can use a repeated ihn ihn is to gather cub and a prr prr is to guide them on a journey a alarm call is used to warn the cub to stand still bickering cub can let out a whirr pitch rise with the intensity of the quarrel and end on a harsh noteanother major mean of communication is by male will often investigate place territory or common landmark for a long time by crouching on his foreleg and carefully smelling the place then he will stand close to an elevated spot such a tree trunk stump or rock with the tail raised and the penis pointed at the area to be marked other observing individual might repeat the ritual female may also show marking behaviour but le prominently than male do among female those in oestrus will show maximum and their excrement can attract male from far off in botswana cheetah are frequently captured by rancher to protect livestock by setting up trap in traditional marking spot the call of the trapped cheetah can attract more cheetah to the placetouch and visual cue are other way of signalling in cheetah social meeting involve mutual sniffing of the mouth anus and genitals individual will groom one another lick each other face and rub cheek however they seldom lean on or rub their flank against each other the tear streak on the face can sharply define expression at close range mother probably use the alternate light and dark ring on the tail to signal their cub to follow them diet and hunting the cheetah is a carnivore that hunt small to prey weighing to kg to lb but mostly le than kg lb it primary prey are ungulate they are the major component of the diet in certain area such a dama and dorcas gazelle in the sahara impala in the eastern and southern african woodland springbok in the arid savanna to the south and thomson gazelle in the serengeti smaller antelope like the common duiker are a frequent prey in the southern kalahari larger ungulate are typically avoided though nyala whose male weigh around kg lb were found to be the major prey in a study in the phinda game reserve in namibia cheetah are the major predator of livestock the diet of the asiatic cheetah consists of livestock a well a chinkara desert hare goitered gazelle urial and wild goat in india cheetah used to prey mostly on blackbuck there are no record of cheetah killing human cheetah in the kalahari have been reported feeding on citron melon for their water content prey preference and hunting success vary with the age sex and number of cheetah involved in the hunt and on the vigilance of the prey generally only group of cheetah coalition or mother and cub will try to kill larger prey mother with cub especially look out for larger prey and tend to be more successful than female without cub individual on the periphery of the prey herd are common target vigilant prey which would react quickly on seeing the cheetah are not preferredcheetahs hunt primarily throughout the day sometimes with peak at dawn and dusk they tend to avoid larger predator like the primarily nocturnal lion cheetah in the sahara and maasai mara kenya hunt after sunset to escape the high temperature of the day cheetah use their vision to hunt instead of their sense of smell they keep a lookout for prey from resting site or low branch the cheetah will stalk it prey trying to conceal itself in cover and approach a close a possible often within to m to ft of the prey or even farther for le alert prey alternatively the cheetah can lie hidden in cover and wait for the prey to come nearer a stalking cheetah assumes a partially crouched posture with the head lower than the shoulder it will move slowly and be still at time in area of minimal cover the cheetah will approach within m ft of the prey and start the chase the chase typically last a minute in a study the length of chase averaged m ft and the longest run measured m ft the cheetah can give up the chase if it is detected by the prey early or if it can not make a kill quickly cheetah catch their prey by tripping it during the chase by hitting it rump with the forepaw or using the strong dewclaw to knock the prey off it balance bringing it down with much force and sometimes even breaking some of it limb cheetah can decelerate dramatically towards the end of the hunt slowing down from mph to mph in just three stride and can easily follow any twist and turn the prey make a it try to flee to kill to prey the cheetah bite the prey throat to suffocate it maintaining the bite for around five minute within which the prey stop struggling a bite on the nape of the neck or the snout and sometimes on the skull suffices to kill smaller prey cheetah have an average hunting success rate of higher for smaller and more vulnerable preyonce the hunt is over the prey is taken near a bush or under a tree the cheetah highly exhausted after the chase rest beside the kill and pant heavily for five to minute meanwhile cheetah nearby who did not take part in the hunt might feed on the kill immediately group of cheetah devour the kill peacefully though minor noise and snapping may be observed cheetah can consume large quantity of food a cheetah at the etosha national park namibia wa found to consume a much a kilogram lb within two hour however on a daily basis a cheetah feed on around kg lb meat cheetah especially mother with cub remain cautious even a they eat pausing to look around for fresh prey or for predator who may steal the kill cheetah move their head from side to side so the sharp carnassial teeth tear the flesh which can then be swallowed without chewing they typically begin with the hindquarter and then progress toward the abdomen and the spine rib are chewed on at the end and the limb are not generally torn apart while eating unless the prey is very small the skeleton is left almost intact after feeding on the meat cheetah might lose of their kill to large carnivore such a hyena and lion and grey wolf in iran to defend itself or it prey a cheetah will hold it body low to the ground and snarl with it mouth wide open the eye staring threateningly ahead and the ear folded backward this may be accompanied by moan hiss and growl and hitting the ground with the forepaw cheetah have rarely been observed scavenging kill this may be due to vulture and spotted hyena adroitly capturing and consuming heavy carcass within a short time reproduction and life cycle cheetah are induced ovulators and can breed throughout the year female can have their first litter at two to three year of age polyestrous female have an oestrus heat cycle is day long on average but it can vary from three day to a month a female can conceive again after to month from giving birth or even sooner if a whole litter is lost male can breed at le than two year of age in captivity but this may be delayed in the wild until the male acquires a territory a study showed that female who gave birth to more litter early in their life often died younger indicating a between longevity and yearly reproductive in male can become more pronounced when a female in their vicinity come into oestrus male sometimes even those in coalition fight among one another to secure access to the female often one male will eventually win dominance over the others and mate with the female though a female can mate with different male mating begin with the male approaching the female who lie down on the ground individual often chirp purr or yelp at this time no courtship behaviour is observed the male immediately secures hold of the female nape and copulation take place the pair then ignore each other but meet and copulate a few more time three to five time a day for the next two to three day before finally parting waysafter a gestation of nearly three month a litter of one to eight cub is born though those of three to four cub are more common birth take place at minute interval in a sheltered place such a thick vegetation the eye are shut at birth and open in four to day newborn cub might spit a lot and make soft churring noise they start walking by two week their nape shoulder and back are thickly covered with long bluish grey hair called a mantle which give them a appearance this fur is shed a the cheetah grows older a study suggested that this mane give a cheetah cub the appearance of a honey badger and could act a camouflage from attack by these badger or predator that tend to avoid them compared to other felid cheetah cub are highly vulnerable to several predator during the first few week of their life mother keep their cub hidden in dense vegetation for the first two month and nurse in the early morning the mother is extremely vigilant at this stage she stay within km mi of the lair frequently visit her cub move them every five to six day and remains with them after dark though she try to make minimal noise she usually can not defend her litter from these predator predation is the leading cause of mortality in cheetah cub a study showed that in area with a low density of predator such a namibian farmland around of the cub make it beyond the age of month whereas in area like the serengeti national park where several large carnivore exist the survival rate wa just death also occur from starvation if their mother abandon them fire or pneumonia because of exposure to bad weather generation length of the cheetah is six yearscubs start coming out of the lair at two month of age trailing after their mother wherever she go at this point the mother nurse le and brings solid food to the cub they retreat away from the carcass in fear initially but gradually start eating it the cub might purr a the mother lick them clean after the meal weaning occurs at four to six month to train her cub in hunting the mother will catch and let go of live prey in front of her cub cub play behaviour includes chasing crouching pouncing and wrestling there is plenty of agility and attack are seldom lethal playing can improve catching skill in cub though the ability to crouch and hide may not develop remarkably cub a young a six month try to capture small prey like hare and young gazelle however they may have to wait until a long a month of age to make a successful kill on their own at around month offspring become independent mother might have conceived again by then sibling may remain together for a few more month before parting way while female stay close to their mother male move farther off the lifespan of wild cheetah is to year for female and their reproductive cycle typically end by year of age male generally live a long a ten year habitat and distribution cheetah appear to be le selective in habitat choice than other felid and inhabit a variety of ecosystem area with greater availability of prey good visibility and minimal chance of encountering larger predator are preferred they seldom occur in tropical forest cheetah have been reported at elevation a high a m ft an open area with some cover such a diffused bush is probably ideal for the cheetah because it need to stalk and pursue it prey over a distance this also minimises the risk of encountering larger carnivore unlike the big cat the cheetah tends to occur in low density typically between and adult per sq mi value are of those reported for leopard and lionscheetahs in eastern and southern africa occur mostly in savanna like the kalahari and serengeti in central northern and western africa cheetah inhabit arid mountain range and valley in the harsh climate of the sahara cheetah prefer high mountain which receive more rainfall than the surrounding desert the vegetation and water resource in these mountain support antelope iranian cheetah occur in hilly terrain of desert at elevation up to m ft where annual precipitation is generally below mm in the primary vegetation in these area is thinly distributed shrub le than m ft tall historical range in prehistoric time the cheetah wa distributed throughout africa asia and europe it gradually fell to extinction in europe possibly because of competition with the lion today the cheetah ha been extirpated in most of it historical range the number of the asiatic cheetah had begun plummeting since the late long before the other subspecies started their decline a of cheetah occur in just nine per cent of their erstwhile range in africa mostly in unprotected areasin the past until the century the cheetah ranged across vast stretch in asia from the arabian peninsula in the west to the indian subcontinent in the east and a far north a the aral and caspian sea a few century ago the cheetah wa abundant in india and it range coincided with the distribution of major prey like the blackbuck however it number in india plummeted from the century onward divyabhanusinh of the bombay natural history society note that the last three individual in the wild were killed by maharaja ramanuj pratap singh of surguja a man also noted for holding a record for shooting tiger in the last confirmed sighting in india wa of a cheetah that drowned in a well near hyderabad in in iran there were around cheetah before world war ii distributed across desert and steppe to the east and the borderland with iraq to the west the number were falling because of a decline in prey in iraq cheetah were reported from basra in the conservation effort in the stabilised the population but prey specie declined again in the wake of the iranian revolution and the war leading to a significant contraction of the cheetah historical range in the regionthe first survey of cheetah population in africa by norman myers in estimated a population of individual throughout africa the range covered most of eastern and southern africa except for the desert region on the western coast of angola and namibia in the following year a their natural habitat ha been modified dramatically cheetah population across the region have become smaller and more fragmented present distribution the cheetah occurs mostly in eastern and southern africa it presence in asia is limited to the central desert of iran though there have been unconfirmed report of sighting in afghanistan iraq and pakistan in the last few decade the global population of cheetah wa estimated at nearly individual in the iranian population appears to have decreased from to individual in to in distributed in three subpopulation over le than sq mi in iran central plateau the largest population nearly individual is sparsely distributed over angola botswana mozambique namibia south africa and zambia another population spread in kenya and tanzania comprises individual all other cheetah occur in small fragmented group mostly le than individual in each throughout the range population are feared to be declining especially those of adult the cheetah wa reintroduced in malawi in threat the cheetah is threatened by several factor like habitat loss and fragmentation of population habitat loss is caused mainly by the introduction of commercial land use such a agriculture and industry it is further aggravated by ecological degradation like bush encroachment common in southern africa moreover the specie apparently requires a sizeable area to live in a indicated by it low population density shortage of prey and conflict with other specie such a human and large carnivore are other major threat the cheetah appears to be le capable of coexisting with human than the leopard with of it range consisting of unprotected land the cheetah is often targeted by farmer and pastoralists who attempt to protect their livestock especially in namibia illegal wildlife trade and trafficking is another problem in some place like ethiopia some tribe like the maasai people in tanzania have been reported to use cheetah skin in ceremony roadkill is another threat especially in area where road have been constructed near natural habitat or protected area case of roadkill involving cheetah have been reported from kalmand touran national park and bafq in iran the reduced genetic variability make cheetah more vulnerable to disease however the threat posed by infectious disease may be minor given the low population density and hence a reduced chance of infection conservation measure the cheetah ha been classified a vulnerable by the iucn it is listed under appendix i of the cm and appendix i of cite the endangered specie act enlists the cheetah a endangered in africa until the cheetah and other carnivore were frequently killed to protect livestock in africa gradually the understanding of cheetah ecology increased and their falling number became a matter of concern the de wildt cheetah and wildlife centre wa set up in in south africa to provide care for wild cheetah regularly trapped or injured by namibian farmer by the first major research project to outline cheetah conservation strategy wa underway the cheetah conservation fund founded in in namibia put effort into field research and education about cheetah on the global platform the ccf run a cheetah genetics laboratory the only one of it kind in otjiwarongo namibia bushblok is an initiative to restore habitat systematically through targeted bush thinning and biomass utilisation several more conservation programme have since been established like cheetah outreach in south africathe global cheetah action plan workshop in laid emphasis on the need for a rangewide survey of wild cheetah to demarcate area for conservation effort and on creating awareness through training program the range wide conservation program for cheetah and african wild dog rwcp began in a a joint initiative of the iucn cat and canid specialist group the wildlife conservation society and the zoological society of london national conservation plan have been developed successfully for several african country in the cite standing committee recognised the cheetah a a specie of priority in their strategy in northeastern africa to counter wildlife trafficking in december the result of an extensive survey detailing the distribution and demography of cheetah throughout the range were published the researcher recommended listing the cheetah a endangered on the iucn red list in asia in the iranian government collaborated with the ccf the iucn panthera corporation undp and the wildlife conservation society on the conservation of asiatic cheetah project cacp to protect the natural habitat of the asiatic cheetah and it prey in the iranian centre for sustainable development cenesta conducted an international workshop to discus conservation plan with local stakeholder iran declared august a national cheetah day in the iranian cheetah strategic planning meet in formulated a conservation plan for asiatic cheetah the cacp phase ii wa implemented in and the third phase wa drafted in the early scientist from the centre for cellular and molecular biology hyderabad proposed a plan to clone asiatic cheetah from iran for reintroduction in india but iran denied the proposal in september the then minister of environment and forest jairam ramesh assigned the wildlife trust of india and the wildlife institute of india with examining the potential of importing african cheetah to india the report submitted in suggested that the kuno wildlife sanctuary and nauradehi wildlife sanctuary in madhya pradesh and shahgarh landscape in rajasthan had a high potential to support reintroduced cheetah population due to their broad area and high prey density however plan for reintroduction were stalled in may by the supreme court of india because of a political dispute and concern over introducing a specie to the country opponent stated the plan wa not a case of intentional movement of an organism into a part of it native range on january the supreme court allowed the central government to introduce cheetah to a suitable habitat in india on an experimental basis to see if they can adapt to it interaction with human taming the cheetah show little aggression toward human and can be tamed easily a it ha been since antiquity the earliest known depiction of the cheetah are from the chauvet cave in france dating back to bc according to historian such a heinz friederichs and burchard brentjes the cheetah wa first tamed in sumer and this gradually spread out to central and northern africa from where it reached india the evidence for this is mainly pictorial for instance a sumerian seal dating back to c bc featuring a leashed animal ha fuelled speculation that the cheetah might have been first tamed in sumer however thomas allsen argues that the depicted animal might be a large dog other historian such a frederick zeuner have opined that ancient egyptian were the first to tame the cheetah from where it gradually spread into central asia iran and indiain comparison theory of the cheetah taming in egypt are stronger and include timeline proposed on this basis mafdet one of the ancient egyptian deity worshiped during the first dynasty bc wa sometimes depicted a a cheetah ancient egyptian believed the spirit of deceased pharaoh were taken away by cheetah relief in the deir temple complex tell of an expedition by egyptian to the land of punt during the reign of hatshepsut bc that fetched among other thing animal called panther during the new kingdom to century bc cheetah were common pet for royalty who adorned them with ornate collar and leash the egyptian would use their dog to bring the concealed prey out in the open after which a cheetah would be set upon it to kill it rock carving depicting cheetah dating back to year ago have been found in twyfelfontein little else ha been discovered in connection to the taming of cheetah or other cat in southern africa hunting cheetah are known in arabic art from yemen hunting with cheetah became more prevalent toward the seventh century ad in the middle east the cheetah would accompany the nobility to hunt in a special seat on the back of the saddle taming wa an elaborate process and could take a year to complete the roman may have referred to the cheetah a the leopardos leopardos or leontopardos leontopardos believing it to be a hybrid between a leopard and a lion because of the mantle seen in cheetah cub and the difficulty of breeding them in captivity a roman hunting cheetah is depicted in a century mosaic from lod israel cheetah continued to be used into the byzantine period of the roman empire with hunting leopard being mentioned in the cynegetica ad in eastern asia record are confusing a regional name for the leopard and the cheetah may be used interchangeably the earliest depiction of cheetah from eastern asia date back to the tang dynasty to century ad painting depict tethered cheetah and cheetah mounted on horse chinese emperor would use cheetah a well a caracal a gift in the and the century the yuan ruler bought numerous cheetah from the western part of the empire and from muslim merchant according to the ming shilu the subsequent ming dynasty to century continued this practice tomb figurine from the mongol empire dating back to the reign of kublai khan bc represent cheetah on horseback the mughal ruler akbar the great ad is said to have kept a many a khasa imperial cheetah his son jahangir wrote in his memoir that only one of them gave birth mughal ruler trained cheetah a well a caracal in a similar way a the western asian and used them to hunt game especially blackbuck the rampant hunting severely affected the population of wild animal in india by cheetah had to be imported from africa in captivity the first cheetah to be brought into captivity in a zoo wa at the zoological society of london in early captive cheetah showed a high mortality rate with an average lifespan of year after trade of wild cheetah wa delimited by the enforcement of cite in more effort were put into breeding in captivity in the number of captive cheetah worldwide wa estimated at around individual with born in captivitymortality under captivity is generally high in of the captive cheetah worldwide died under one year of age mostly within a month of birth death result from several birth defect cannibalism hypothermia neglect of cub by mother and infectious disease compared to other felid cheetah need specialised care because of their higher vulnerability to disease this ha been attributed to their low genetic variability and factor of captive life common disease of cheetah include feline herpesvirus feline infectious peritonitis gastroenteritis glomerulosclerosis leukoencephalopathy myelopathy nephrosclerosis and disease high density of cheetah in a place closeness to other large carnivore in enclosure improper handling exposure to public and frequent movement between zoo can be source of stress for cheetah recommended management practice for cheetah include spacious and ample access to outdoors stress minimisation by exercise and limited handling and following proper protocol especially for pregnant female cheetah are poor breeder in captivity while wild individual are far more successful this ha also been linked to increased stress level in captive individual in a study in serengeti female were found to have a success rate in breeding compared to recorded for north american captive cheetah in another study on november a female cheetah named bingwa gave birth to eight cub in the st louis zoo setting a record for the most birth recorded by the association of zoo and aquarium a study suggested that replication of social group observed in the wild like coalition could improve chance of successful mating in captive male in culture the cheetah ha been widely portrayed in a variety of artistic work in bacchus and ariadne an oil painting by the italian painter titian the chariot of the greek god dionysus bacchus is depicted a being drawn by two cheetah the cheetah in the painting were previously considered to be leopard in english painter george stubbs commemorated the gifting of a cheetah to george iii by the english governor of madras sir george pigot in his painting cheetah with two indian attendant and a stag the painting depicts a cheetah hooded and collared by two indian servant along with a stag it wa supposed to prey upon the painting the caress by the belgian symbolist painter fernand khnopff is a representation of the myth of oedipus and the sphinx it portrays a creature with a woman head and a cheetah body often misidentified a a leopard the bill thomas cheetah american car a coupe first designed and driven in wa an attempt to challenge carroll shelby shelby cobra in american sport car competition of the era because only two dozen or fewer chassis were built with only a dozen complete car the cheetah wa never homologated for competition beyond prototype status it production ended in variety of literature mention the
