the cougar puma concolor is a large cat of the subfamily felinae it is native to the america it range span from the canadian yukon to the southern andes in south america and is the widest of any large wild terrestrial mammal in the western hemisphere it is an adaptable generalist specie occurring in most american habitat type due to it wide range it ha many name including puma mountain lion panther painter and catamount it is the cat in the new world after the jaguar secretive and largely solitary by nature the cougar is properly considered both nocturnal and crepuscular although daytime sighting do occur the cougar is more closely related to smaller feline including the domestic cat than to any specie of subfamily pantherinae of which only the jaguar is extant in the america the cougar is an ambush predator that pursues a wide variety of prey primary food source are ungulate particularly deer it also hunt specie a small a insect and rodent this cat prefers habitat with dense underbrush and rocky area for stalking but can also live in open area the cougar is territorial and survives at low population density individual territory size depend on terrain vegetation and abundance of prey while large it is not always the apex predator in it range yielding prey it ha killed to jaguar american black bear grizzly bear american alligator florida panther predation mainly and to group of gray wolf or coyote it is reclusive and mostly avoids people fatal attack on human are rare but have recently been increasing in north america a more people enter cougar territory and build development such a farm in their established territory intensive hunting following european colonization of the america and the ongoing human development into cougar habitat ha caused population to drop in most part of it historical range in particular the north american cougar is considered to have been mostly extirpated in eastern north america the population referred to a the eastern cougar in the beginning of the century except for the isolated florida panther subpopulation naming and etymology the word is borrowed from the portuguese cucuarana via french it wa originally derived from the tupi language a current form in brazil is sucuarana in the century georg marcgrave named it cuguacu ara marcgrave rendering wa reproduced in by his associate willem piso cuguacu ara wa then adopted by john ray in in leclerc comte de buffon converted cuguacu ara to cuguar which wa later modified to cougar in englishpuma is the common name used in latin america and most part of europe the term puma is also used in the united state the first use of in english date to introduced from spanish and prior from the peruvian quechua language in the century where it mean powerful in the united state and canada it is also called mountain lion a name first used in writing in other name include panther painter and catamount early spanish explorer of the america called it monte meaning cat of the mountain and meaning lionthe cougar hold the guinness record for the animal with the greatest number of name with over in english alone taxonomy and evolution felis concolor wa the scientific name proposed by carl linnaeus in for a cat with a long tail from brasilia it wa placed in the genus puma by william jardine in this genus is part of the felinae the cougar is most closely related to the jaguarundi a well a the modern cheetah of africa and western asia subspecies following linnaeus first scientific description of the cougar cougar zoological specimen were described and proposed a subspecies until the late genetic analysis of cougar mitochondrial dna indicate that many of these are too similar to be recognized a distinct at a molecular level but that only six phylogeographic group exist the florida panther sample showed a low microsatellite variation possibly due to inbreeding following this research the author of mammal specie of the world recognized the following six subspecies in p c concolor linnaeus includes the synonym bangsi incarum osgoodi soasoaranna sussuarana soderstromii sucuacuara and wavula p c puma molina includes the synonym araucanus concolor patagonica pearsoni and puma trouessart p c couguar kerr includes arundivaga aztecus browni californica floridana hippolestes improcera kaibabensis mayensis missoulensis olympus oregonensis schorgeri stanleyana vancouverensis and youngi p c costaricensis merriam p c anthonyi nelson and goldman includes acrocodia borbensis capricornensis concolor greeni and nigra p c cabrerae pocock includes hudsonii and puma proposed by marcelli in the florida panther wa still referred to a a distinct subspecies p c coryi in research worksas of the cat classification taskforce of the cat specialist group recognizes only two subspecies a valid p c concolor in south america possibly excluding the region northwest of the andes and p c couguar in north and central america and possibly northwestern south america evolution the family felidae is believed to have originated in asia about million year ago taxonomic research on felid remains partial and much of what is known about their evolutionary history is based on mitochondrial dna analysis significant confidence interval exist with suggested date in the latest genomic study of the felidae the common ancestor of today leopardus lynx puma prionailurus and felis lineage migrated across the bering land bridge into the america to million year ago mya the lineage subsequently diverged in that order north american felid then invaded south america mya a part of the great american interchange following formation of the isthmus of panama but the relationship is unresolved the cheetah lineage is suggested by some study to have diverged from the puma lineage in the america see american cheetah and migrated back to asia and africa while other research suggests the cheetah diverged in the old world itself a high level of genetic similarity ha been found among north american cougar population suggesting they are all fairly recent descendant of a small ancestral group culver et al propose the original north american cougar population wa extirpated during the pleistocene extinction some year ago when other large mammal such a smilodon also disappeared north america wa then repopulated by south american cougarsa coprolite identified a from a cougar wa excavated in argentina catamarca province and dated to year old it contained toxascaris leonina egg this finding indicates that cougar and the parasite existed in south america since at least the late pleistocene characteristic the head of the cat is round and the ear are erect it powerful forequarter neck and jaw serve to grasp and hold large prey it ha five retractable claw on it forepaw one a dewclaw and four on it hind paw the larger front foot and claw are adaptation to clutching preycougars are slender and agile member of the felidae they are the cat specie worldwide adult stand about to cm to in tall at the shoulder adult male are around m ft long from nose to tail tip and female average m ft with overall range between to m to ft nose to tail suggested for the specie in general of this length the tail typically account for to cm to in male generally weigh to kg to lb averaging kg lb female typically weigh between and kg and lb averaging kg lb cougar size is smallest close to the equator and larger towards the pole the largest recorded cougar shot in weighed kg lb claim of kg lb and kg lb have been reported though they were most likely exaggerated on average adult male cougar in british columbia weigh kg lb and adult female kg lb though several male cougar in british columbia weighed between and kg and lb depending on the locality cougar can be smaller or bigger than jaguar but are le muscular and not a powerfully built so their weight is on average le whereas cougar tend to be larger a distance increase from the equator which cross the northern portion of south america jaguar are simply generally smaller north of the amazon river in south america and larger south of that river for example while south american jaguar are comparatively large and may exceed kg lb those in mexico biosphere reserve weigh about the same a female cougar approximately kg lb the cougar is on average larger than all felid specie apart from the lion tiger and jaguar despite it size it is not typically classified among the big cat because it can not roar lacking the specialized larynx and hyoid apparatus of panthera compared to big cat cougar are often silent with minimal communication through vocalization outside of the relationship cougar sometimes voice hiss growl and purr a well a chirp and whistle many of which are comparable to those of domestic cat they are well known for their scream a referenced in some of their common name although these scream are often misinterpreted to be the call of other animal or humanscougar coloring is plain hence the latin concolor but can vary greatly across individual and even sibling the coat is typically tawny like that of the lion which is why it wa initially called the mountain lion but it otherwise range from or reddish with lighter patch on the underbody including the jaw chin and throat infant are spotted and born with blue eye and ring on their tail juvenile are pale and dark spot remain on their flank despite anecdote to the contrary coloring melanism ha never been documented in cougar the term black panther is used colloquially to refer to melanistic individual of other specie particularly jaguar and leopard a leucistic individual wa seen in serra do orgaos national park in rio de janeiro in when it wa recorded by way of a camera trap indicating that extremely rare pure white individual cougar do exist in the speciesthe cougar ha large paw and proportionally the largest hind leg in felidae allowing for it great leaping and ability it is capable of leaping from the ground up to m high into a tree distribution and habitat the cougar ha the largest range of any wild land animal in the america it range span degree of latitude from northern yukon in canada to the southern andes it wide distribution stem from it adaptability to virtually every habitat type it life in all forest type a well a in lowland and mountainous desert but also in open area with little vegetation in the santa ana mountain it prefers steep canyon escarpment rim rock and dense brushthe cougar wa extirpated across most of it eastern north american range with a notable exception of florida in the two century after european colonization and faced grave threat elsewhere it currently range across most western american state including occasional sighting from alaska the canadian province of alberta saskatchewan and british columbia and the canadian territory of yukon there have been widely debated report of possible recolonization of eastern north america dna evidence ha suggested it presence in eastern north america while a consolidated map of cougar sighting show numerous report from the great plain through to eastern canada the quebec wildlife service also considers cougar to be present in the province a a threatened specie after multiple dna test confirmed cougar hair in lynx mating site the only unequivocally known eastern population is the critically endangered florida panther there have been unconfirmed sighting in elliotsville plantation maine north of monson and a early a in new hampshire in the michigan department of natural resource confirmed a cougar sighting in michigan upper peninsula typically sighting of cougar involve young male which can travel great distance to establish range away from established male all four confirmed cougar kill in iowa since involved maleson april police fatally shot a cougar on the north side of chicago illinois dna test were consistent with cougar from the black hill of south dakota le than a year later on march a cougar wa photographed and unsuccessfully tranquilized by state wildlife biologist in a tree near spooner wisconsin in the northwestern part of the state other eastern sighting since have occurred in location such a greene county indiana greenwich and milford connecticut morgan county pike county and whiteside county illinois and bourbon county kentuckyin tennessee no confirmed sighting had been made since the early the first confirmed sighting in a century wa made on september in obion county in the corner of west tennessee six day later and about km mi to the southeast a hair sample wa found in carroll county dna analysis revealed that it wa from a female genetically similar to south dakota cougar since then there have been at least eight additional confirmed sighting in the state all were immediately east of the tennessee river in middle tennessee initially in humphreys county and on september further south in wayne countysouth of the rio grande the international union for conservation of nature iucn list the cat in every central and south american country while specific state and provincial statistic are often available in north america much le is known about the cat in it southern rangethe cougar total breeding population is estimated at le than by the iucn with a declining trend u statistic are often more optimistic suggesting cougar population have rebounded in oregon a healthy population of wa reported in exceeding a target of california ha actively sought to protect the cat and ha an estimated population of to study using camera in rio los cipreses national reserve counted a population of two male and two female one of them with at least two cub in an area of cougar per the bay area puma project aim to obtain information on cougar population in the san francisco bay area and the animal interaction with habitat prey human and residential communitiesit is speculated and believed by many that the western cougar is recolonizing the eastern cougar former range in the northeastern united state and there is growing evidence that support this claim indicating a small but growing population of western cougar in the northeastern state mostly cougar migrating from the midwestern united state though possibly also from canada in april an experienced tracker named john mccarter found the mauled carcass of a beaver with scat nearby in the quabbin reservoir in massachusetts the scat wa tested positive a being from a mountain lion in march steve ward a dcr forester in the state of massachusetts photographed track in the quabbin reservoir the track are believed to have been made by the same mountain lion that wa seen in minnesota michigan upstate new york and connecticut before later being struck by an suv and killed in connecticut on a highway that same year the animal is believed to have originated from the black hill of south dakota mountain lion are well documented in the state of wisconsin with several confirmed sighting with photo and video evidence being a recent a august with many other sighting earlier that year and during the previous year of habitat fragmentation with the increase of human development and infrastructure growth in california the north american cougar population are becoming more isolated from one another behavior and ecology aside from human no specie prey upon mature cougar in the wild although conflict with other predator or scavenger occur of the large predator in yellowstone national park the grizzly bear the black bear the gray wolf and the cougar the massive grizzly bear appears dominant often but not always able to drive a gray wolf pack a black bear and a cougar off their kill one study found that grizzly and american black bear visited of cougar kill in yellowstone and glacier national park usurping of carcass bear gained up to and cougar lost up to of their respective daily energy requirement from these encounter in colorado and california black bear were found to visit and of kill respectively in general cougar are subordinate to black bear when it come to kill and when bear are most active the cat take prey more frequently and spend le time feeding on each kill unlike several subordinate predator from other ecosystem cougar do not appear to take advantage of spatial or temporal refuge to avoid their competitorsthe gray wolf and the cougar compete more directly for prey mostly in winter pack of wolf can steal cougar kill and there are some documented case of cougar being killed by them one report describes a large pack of to wolf killing a female cougar and her kitten while in nearby sun valley idaho a male cougar wa found dead apparently killed by wolf pack conversely confrontation tend to be dominated by the cat and there are various documented account where wolf have been ambushed and killed including adult male specimen wolf more broadly affect cougar population dynamic and distribution by dominating territory and prey opportunity and disrupting the feline behavior preliminary research in yellowstone for instance ha shown displacement of the cougar by wolf one researcher in oregon noted when there is a pack around cougar are not comfortable around their kill or raising kitten a lot of time a big cougar will kill a wolf but the pack phenomenon change the table both specie are capable of killing predator such a bobcat canada lynx wolverine and coyote and tend to suppress their number although cougar can kill coyote the latter have been documented attempting to prey on cougar cubsalthough it is le specialized than other big cat in predation of crocodilian a case in florida wa documented in where a cougar hunted a specimen of american alligator meter long the largest registered crocodilian taken by a cougar which suggests the ability of large cougar to prey on similar sized specimen of the remaining big crocodilian specie with which they share habitat in different part of the america american crocodile black caiman and orinoco crocodile however adult specimen of the reptile are big enough to prey on cougar in return if they have the chance which occurs only on rare occasion a the cougar tend to avoid body of water where crocodilian are present however there are documented case of adult american alligator preying on cougar in florida in the southern portion of it range the cougar and jaguar share overlapping territory the jaguar tends to take the larger prey where range overlap reducing both the cougar potential size and the likelihood of direct competition between the two cat cougar appear better than jaguar at exploiting a broader prey niche and smaller preyas with any predator at or near the top of it food chain the cougar impact the population of prey specie predation by cougar ha been linked to change in the specie mix of deer in a region for example a study in british columbia observed that the population of mule deer a favored cougar prey wa declining while the population of the le frequently deer wa increasing the vancouver island marmot an endangered specie endemic to one region of dense cougar population ha seen decreased number due to cougar and gray wolf predation nevertheless there is a measurable effect on the quality of deer population by puma predationin the southern part of south america the cougar is a top level predator that ha controlled the population of guanaco and other specie since prehistoric time cougar also prey on bear cub hunting and diet a successful generalist predator the cougar will eat any animal it can catch from insect to large ungulate over kg lb like other cat it is an obligate carnivore meaning it must feed on meat to survive the mean weight of vertebrate prey mwvp that puma attack increase with the puma body weight in general mwvp is lower in area closer to the equator it most important prey specie are various deer specie particularly in north america mule deer deer elk and even bull moose are taken other specie such a the bighorn and dall sheep horse fallow deer caribou mountain goat coyote american badger and pronghorn a survey of north america research found of prey item were ungulate especially deer only the florida panther showed variation often preferring feral hog and armadillo investigation at yellowstone national park showed that elk followed by mule deer were the cougar primary target the prey base is shared with the park gray wolf with which the cougar competes for resource another study on winter kill in alberta showed that ungulate accounted for greater than of the cougar diet learned individual prey recognition wa observed a some cougar rarely killed bighorn sheep while others relied heavily on the speciesin pacific rim national park reserve scat sample showed raccoon to make up of the cougar diet harbor seal and blacktail deer each north american river otter california sea lion and american mink the remaining were unidentifiedin the central and south american cougar range the ratio of deer in the diet decline small to mammal are preferred including large rodent such a the capybara ungulate accounted for only of prey item in one survey about half that of north america competition with the larger jaguar in south america ha been suggested for the decline in the size of prey item however a study by and showed that the cougar and jaguar in central or north america may share the same prey depending on it abundance other listed prey specie of the cougar include mouse porcupine beaver raccoon hare guanaco peccary vicuna rhea and wild turkey bird and small reptile are sometimes preyed upon in the south but this is rarely recorded in north americain patagonia monte leon national park the local cougar population ha specialized on hunting penguinsalthough capable of sprinting the cougar is typically an ambush predator it stalk through brush and tree across ledge or other covered spot before delivering a powerful leap onto the back of it prey and a suffocating neck bite the cougar is capable of breaking the neck of some of it smaller prey with a strong bite and momentum bearing the animal to the ground kill are generally estimated around one large ungulate every two week the period shrink for female raising young and may be a short a one kill every three day when cub are nearly mature around month the cat drag a kill to a preferred spot cover it with brush and return to feed over a period of day the cougar is generally reported to not be a scavenger but deer carcass left exposed for study were scavenged by cougar in california suggesting more opportunistic behavior reproduction and life cycle female reach sexual maturity between to three year of age they typically average one litter every two to three year throughout their reproductive life though the period can be a short a one year female are in estrus for about day of a cycle the gestation period is approximately day female are sometimes reported a monogamous but this is uncertain and polygyny may be more common copulation is brief but frequent chronic stress can result in low reproductive rate when in captivity a well a in the fieldonly female are involved in parenting litter size is between one and six cub typically two cave and other alcove that offer protection are used a litter den born blind cub are completely dependent on their mother at first and begin to be weaned at around three month of age a they grow they begin to go out on foray with their mother first visiting kill site and after six month beginning to hunt small prey on their own kitten survival rate are just over one per litter newborn cougar have spot that fade and eventually disappear by the age of year juvenile remain with their mother at least for two yearsyoung adult leave their mother to attempt to establish their own territory at around two year of age and sometimes earlier male tend to leave sooner one study ha shown high mortality amongst cougar that travel farthest from the maternal range often due to conflict with other cougar intraspecific competition research in new mexico ha shown that male dispersed significantly farther than female were more likely to traverse large expanse of habitat and were probably most responsible for nuclear gene flow between habitat patch life expectancy in the wild is reported at eight to year and probably average eight to a female of at least year wa reported killed by hunter on vancouver island cougar may live a long a year in captivity cause of death in the wild include disability and disease competition with other cougar starvation accident and where allowed human hunting feline immunodeficiency virus an endemic virus in cat is to the cougar social structure and home range like almost all cat the cougar is a mostly solitary animal only mother and kitten live in group with adult meeting rarely while generally loner cougar will reciprocally share kill with one another and seem to organize themselves into small community defined by the territory of dominant male cat within these area socialize more frequently with each other than with outsider estimate of territory size for cougar vary greatly canadian geographic report large male territory of to to sq mi with female range half that size other research suggests a much smaller lower limit of sq mi but an even greater upper limit of sq mi for male in the united state very large range have been reported in texas and the black hill of the northern great plain in excess of sq mi male range may include or overlap with those of female but at least where studied not with those of other male which reduces conflict between cougar range of female may overlap slightly with each other scrape mark urine and feces are used to mark territory and attract mate male may scrape together a small pile of leaf and grass and then urinate on it a a way of marking territoryhome range size and overall cougar abundance depend on terrain vegetation and prey abundance one female adjacent to the san andres mountain wa found with a large range of sq mi necessitated by poor prey abundance research ha shown cougar abundance from animal to a much a in one study in south america per sq mi because male disperse farther than female and compete more directly for mate and territory they are more likely to be involved in conflict where a juvenile fails to leave his maternal range for example he may be killed by his father when male encounter each other they hiss spit and may engage in violent conflict if neither back down hunting or relocation of the cougar may increase aggressive encounter by disrupting territory and bringing young transient animal into conflict with established individual threat the cougar is threatened by habitat loss habitat fragmentation and depletion of it prey base due to poaching in florida it is threatened by heavy traffic which cause frequent fatal accident involving cougar highway are a major barrier for dispersal of cougar conservation status the cougar is listed a least concern on the iucn red list since it is also listed on cite appendix ii hunting it is prohibited in california costa rica honduras nicaragua guatemala panama venezuela colombia french guiana suriname bolivia brazil chile paraguay uruguay and most of argentina establishing wildlife corridor and protecting sufficient range area are critical for the sustainability of cougar population research simulation showed that it face a low extinction risk in area which are larger than sq mi between one and four new individual entering a population per decade markedly increase persistence thus highlighting the importance of habitat corridorsin the united state east of the mississippi river the only unequivocally known cougar population is the florida panther until the united state fish and wildlife service usfws recognized both an eastern cougar claimed to be a subspecies by some denied by others and the florida panther affording protection under the endangered specie act in the documented count for the florida wa individual in march the usfws declared the eastern cougar extinct with the taxonomic uncertainty about it existence a a subspecies a well a the possibility of eastward migration of cougar from the western range the subject remains openthis uncertainty ha been recognized by canadian authority the canadian federal agency called committee on the status of endangered wildlife in canada rate it current data a insufficient to draw conclusion regarding the eastern cougar survival and it website say that despite many sighting in the past two decade from eastern canada there are insufficient data to evaluate the taxonomy or assign a status to this cougar notwithstanding numerous reported sighting in ontario quebec new brunswick and nova scotia it ha been said that the evidence is inconclusive a there may not be a distinct subspecies and some sighting may be of escaped pet regulated cougar hunting is still common in the united state and canada although cougar are protected from all hunting in the yukon hunting is permitted in every u state except california from the rocky mountain to the pacific ocean the cougar can not be legally killed without a permit in california except under very specific circumstance such a when a cougar is in act of pursuing livestock or domestic animal or is declared a threat to public safetytexas is the only u state with a viable cougar population that is not protected in texas the cougar is considered a nuisance wildlife and any person holding a hunting or a trapping permit can kill a cougar regardless of the season number killed sex or age of the animal the organization balanced ecology inc launched the texas mountain lion conservation project in the project aim at raising awareness of local people about the status and ecological role of the cougar and mitigating conflict between landowner and cougar relationship with human attack on human in north america the pertinent north american subspecies is p concolor couguar due to the expanding human population cougar range increasingly overlap with area inhabited by human attack on human are very rare a cougar prey recognition is a learned behavior and they do not generally recognize human a prey in a study in new mexico of wild cougar who were not habituated to human the animal did not exhibit threatening behavior to researcher who approached closely median m foot except in of case of those were female with cub attack on people livestock and pet may occur when a puma habituates to human or is in a condition of severe starvation attack are most frequent during late spring and summer when juvenile cougar leave their mother and search for new territorybetween and in north america there were reported confirmed attack on human resulting in nonfatal injury and death of human the total is greater than because some attack had more than one victim by the count had climbed to attack and deathswithin north america the distribution of attack is not uniform the heavily populated state of california saw a dozen attack to after just three from to including three fatality washington state wa the site of a fatal attack in it first since lightly populated new mexico reported an attack in the first there since with many predator a cougar may attack if cornered if a fleeing human stimulates their instinct to chase or if a person play dead standing still may cause the cougar to consider a person easy prey exaggerating the threat to the animal through intense eye contact loud shouting and any other action to appear larger and more menacing may make the animal retreat fighting back with stick and rock or even bare hand is often effective in persuading an attacking cougar to disengagewhen cougar do attack they usually employ their characteristic neck bite attempting to position their teeth between the vertebra and into the spinal cord neck head and spinal injury are common and sometimes fatal child are at greatest risk of attack and least likely to survive an encounter detailed research into attack prior to showed that of all victim and almost all fatality were child the same study showed the highest proportion of attack to have occurred in british columbia particularly on vancouver island where cougar population are especially dense preceding attack on human cougar display aberrant behavior such a activity during daylight hour a lack of fear of human and stalking human there have sometimes been incident of pet cougar mauling peopleresearch on new wildlife collar may be able to reduce conflict by predicting when and where predatory animal hunt this may save the life of human pet and livestock a well a the life of these large predatory mammal that are important to the balance of ecosystem in south america puma in the southern cone of america often called argentine cougar by north american are reputed to be extremely reluctant to attack man in legend they defended people against jaguar the nineteenth century naturalist felix de azara and william henry hudson thought that attack on people even child or sleeping adult did not happen hudson citing anecdotal evidence from hunter claimed that puma were positively inhibited from attacking people even in in fact attack on human although exceedingly rare have occurredan early authenticated case occurred near lake viedma patagonia in when a female mauled the argentine scientist francisco p moreno moreno afterwards showed the scar to theodore roosevelt in this instance however moreno had been wearing a poncho round his neck and head a protection against the cold in patagonia the guanaco is the puma chief prey animal another authenticated case occurred in in iguazu national park northeast argentina when the son of a ranger wa killed by a female puma forensic analysis found specimen of the child hair and clothing fiber in the animal stomach in this area the coati is the puma chief prey despite prohibitory sign coati are by tourist in the park causing unnatural approximation between cougar and human this particular puma had been raised in captivity and released into the wild in a woman wa found dead in a mountainous area in salta province in northwest argentina claw incision which severed a jugular vein indicated that the attacker wa a felid differential diagnosis ruled out other possible perpetrator there were no bite mark on the victim who had been herding goatsfatal attack by other carnivore such a feral dog can be misattributed to puma without appropriate forensic knowledge livestock predation during the early year of ranching cougar were considered on par with wolf in destructiveness according to figure in texas in calf of texas million cattle and calf mohair goat mohair kid sheep of texas million sheep and lamb and lamb of texas million lamb were confirmed to have been killed by cougar that year in nevada in cougar were confirmed to have killed nine calf one horse four foal five goat sheep and lamb in both report sheep were the most frequently attacked some instance of surplus killing have resulted in the death of sheep in one attack a cougar killing bite is applied to the back of the neck head or throat and the cat inflicts puncture mark with it claw usually seen on the side and underside of the prey sometimes also shredding the prey a it hold on coyote also typically bite the throat but the work of a cougar is generally clean while bite inflicted by coyote and dog leave ragged edge the size of the tooth puncture mark also help distinguish kill made by cougar from those made by smaller predatorsremedial hunting appears to have the paradoxical effect of increased livestock predation and complaint of conflict in a study the most important predictor of puma problem were remedial hunting of puma the previous year each additional puma on the landscape increased predation and complaint by but each additional animal killed on the landscape during the previous year increased complaint by the effect had a relationship with very heavy removal of adult puma remedial hunting leading to a increase in livestock and human conflict this effect is attributed to the removal of older puma that have learned to avoid people and their replacement by younger male that react differently to human remedial hunting enables younger male to enter the former territory of the older animal predation on dog predation by cougar on dog is widespread but occurs at low frequency in mythology the grace and power of the cougar have been widely admired in the culture of the indigenous people of the america the inca city of cusco is reported to have been designed in the shape of a cougar and the animal also gave it name to both inca region and people the moche people represented the puma often in their ceramic the sky and thunder god of the inca viracocha ha been associated with the animalin north america mythological description of the cougar have appeared in the story of the hocak language or winnebago of wisconsin and illinois and the cheyenne amongst others to the apache and walapai of arizona the wail of the cougar wa a harbinger of death the algonquin and ojibwe believe that the cougar lived in the underworld and wa wicked whereas it wa a sacred animal among the cherokee in sport several sport team currently or in the past have used the cougar a the mascot for their team although the name actually used ha depended on the most popular regional name for the specie in college sport team brigham young university in utah and washington state university in the northwestern united state and the university of houston on the great plain of the united state use the cougar a their mascot on canada prairie mount royal university in calgary and the university of regina in saskatchewan use the cougar a their mascot in professional hockey the cougar wa used by two team and one northwestern team the chicago cougar of the world hockey association operated from while the red wing of the national hockey league were called the cougar from their
