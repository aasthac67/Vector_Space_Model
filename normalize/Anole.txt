dactyloidae are a family of lizards commonly known as anoles us listen and native to warmer parts of the americas ranging from southeastern united states to paraguay instead of treating it as a family some authorities prefer to treat it as a subfamily dactyloinae of the family iguanidae in the past they were included in the family polychrotidae together with polychrus bush anoles but the latter genus is not closely related to the true anolesanoles are small to fairly large lizards typically green or brownish but their color varies depending on species and many can also change it in most species at least the male has a dewlap an often brightly colored flap of skin that extends from the and is used in displays anoles share several characteristics with geckos including details of the foot structure for climbing and the ability to voluntarily break off the tail to escape predators but they are only very distantly related anoles being part of iguaniaanoles are active during the day and feed mostly on small animals such as insects but some will also take fruits flowers and nectar they are fiercely territorial after mating the female lays an egg occasionally two in many species she may do so every few days or weeks the egg is typically placed on the ground but in some species it is placed at higher levelsanoles are widely studied in fields such as ecology behavior and evolution and some species are commonly kept in captivity as pets anoles can function as a biological pest control by eating insects that may harm humans or plants but represent a serious risk to small native animals and ecosystems if introduced to regions outside their home range distribution and habitat anoles are a very diverse and plentiful group of lizards they are native to tropical and subtropical south america central america mexico the offshore east pacific cocos gorgona and malpelo islands the west indies and southeastern united statesa particularly high species richness exists in cuba more than species hispaniola more than mexico more than central america colombia more than and ecuador at least fewer live in eastern and central south america for example less than species are known from huge brazil contiguous united states native species and the lesser antilles about species in total with species on each island however the lesser antilles are relatively rich compared to their very small land area and their species are all highly localized endemics each only found on one or a few diminutive islands in south america the diversity is considerably higher west of the andes region than east amazon basin as well illustrated in ecuador where about of the anole species live in the former region and in the latter the only species native to the contiguous united states is the carolina or green anole which ranges as far west as central texas and north to oklahoma tennessee and virginia its northern limit is likely related to cold winter temperatures several anole species have been introduced to the contiguous us mostly florida but also other gulf coast states and california the most prevalent of these introductions is the brown anole in contrast to the contiguous united states puerto rico and the virgin islands are home to native species all endemicanoles inhabit a wide range of habitats from highlands up to at least m or ft above sea level to the coast and rainforest to desert scrub a few live in limestone karst habitats and at least two of these the cuban cave anole and mexican cave anole will enter caves sometimes occurring as much as m ft from the entrance some species live close to humans and may use fences or walls of building as perches even inhabiting gardens or trees along roads in large cities like miami most anoles are arboreal or but there are also terrestrial and species they are often especially in the caribbean grouped into six giant trunk crown trunk trunk ground twig and grass inhabit specific niches other less widely used groups are ground ground bush twig giant saxicolous and riparian alternatively however the species within each ecomorph group are not entirely alike and there are variations in the details of their niches including both widespread generalists and more restricted specialists the niche differentiation allows several anoles to inhabit the same locality with up to species at a single site appearance and behavior anoles vary in size males generally reach a larger size than females but in a few species it is the other way around adults of most anoles are between and cm in in length and between and cm in in total length including the tail in the smallest the grass anole the length is about and cm and in in females and males respectively but it is a relatively species there are several large species that are more than cm in in length males of the largest the knight anole reach up to about cm in in length cm in in total length and g oz in weight there are both robust and gracile species and the head shape varies from relatively broad to elongatethe tail of anoles varies but mostly it is longer than the length depending on exact species it can range from slightly shorter to about three times the the caribbean twig ecomorph anoles proboscis anole and phenacosaurus anoles have a prehensile tail anoles tend to have relatively tall vertically flattened tails that aid in swimmingunderneath an anole toes are pads that have several to a dozen flaps of skin adhesive lamellae going horizontally and covered in microscopic hairlike protrusions setae that allow them to cling to many different surfaces similar to but not quite as efficient as a gecko despite this similarity they are very distantly related and the adaptions are the result of convergent evolution in the two groups the extent of these structures and clinging ability varies being more developed in anole species that live high in the tree canopy than ones living at lower levels in one extreme are anoles that easily can run up windows in the opposite end of the spectrum is the bulky anole of arid coastal venezuela and adjacent colombia which is the only species completely lacking the specialized toe pad structures the relative length of the limbs vary mainly between different species but to some extent also between different populations of a single species this depends on things like the preferred perch size and whether there are predators in a habitatdespite having relatively small eyes their primary sense is sight which is excellent and in color their pupils are round or nearly round the guantanamo anole and cuban cave anole have a transparent window in their lower eyelid allowing them to see even with closed eyes but why they have this adaption is unclear anoles have a good directional hearing which is able to detect frequencies between and hz and relatively low intensity sounds like the click of a cameraanoles are during the can also be active during bright moonlit nights and may forage near artificial lights many species frequently bask in the sun to increase their temperature but others are and do not colors most anoles are brownish or green but there are extensive variations depending on the exact species the majority can change their color depending on things like emotions for example aggression or stress activity level levels of light and as a social signal for example displaying dominance but evidence showing that they do it in response to the color of the background camouflage is lacking whether they do it in response to temperature thermoregulation is less clear with studies supporting it and contradicting it the extent and variations of this color changing ability differ widely throughout the individual species for example the carolina or green anole can change its color from a bright leafy green to a dull brown color while the brown anole can only change its shade ranging from pale to very dark brown even the distinct change in the carolina anole can happen in only a few minutes the colors are the result of their skin pigment cells the chromatophores of which they have three main types but the change occurs only in the melanophores when triggered by hormone and other hormones the melanosomes of the melanophores partially cover the other skin pigment cells giving the anole a darker or browner color in most cases stress results in a color but in the aquatic anole a species that is dark brown with a barred pattern and light brown stripes on the sides of its body and head stress results in paler brown upperparts and the stripes turn pale colors during the night when sleeping often differ distinctly from their colors during the day where awake among these are some species that otherwise do not drastically change their colors including certain anoles that generally are brown during the day changing to greenish or whitish when sleeping at night and certain anoles that generally are green during the day changing to brown when sleeping at night disregarding color change minor individual variations in the basic color and pattern mostly related to sex or age are common in some anole species this variation is more pronounced and not only related to sex and age an example of this is the basic color of the cayman anole which varies geographically roughly matching the main habitat at a location in others it occurs at the same location this includes the extensive individual variations in the guadeloupean anole which however also shows some geographic variations but possibly not consistent enough due in part to clines to make the typically recognized subspecies valid in the puerto rican giant anole a species only able to perform minor color changes essentially juveniles are and adults typically green but an uncommon morph maintains a color into adulthood similarly rare morphs of the usually green carolina anole lack certain pigment cells giving them a mainly or yellow color dewlap not species have dewlaps made of erectile cartilage modified from the hyoid and covered in skin that extend from their throat areas when not in use and closed it lies inconspicuously along the throat and chest the size shape color and pattern of the dewlap vary extensively depending on species and often it differs between the sexes being smaller in some absent less colorful in females in a few species including the carolina bark cochran gianthead and slender anoles it varies geographically in color depending on subspecies or morph very locally distinct morphs of a single species that differ in dewlap colors not just differences between sexes may occur together in addition to colors that are visible to humans dewlaps can have ultraviolet reflectance which is visible to anoles the striped anole is the only species where it is asymmetrically colored being brighter on one side than the other in some species even juveniles have a dewlap the west cuban and cuban stream anoles are the only where both sexes lack a dewlap but it is reduced and diminutive in about a dozen other speciesthe dewlap serves as a signal for attracting partners territoriality deterring predators and communicating condition when several anoles live together the species almost always differ in their dewlap indicating that it plays a role in species recognition studies however reveal a more complex pattern the bark anole and shortnosed anole species complex which includes the webster and cochran gianthead anoles are closely related and both vary in their dewlap color in places where their ranges overlap their dewlaps often differ and there is little hybridization but in some location their dewlaps are alike where alike there can be higher levels of hybridization indicating that they are more likely to confuse each other or levels can be as low as regions where they differ indicating that something else allows them to separate each other another example is the stout and anoles which are sister species that overlap in range and are very similar except for their dewlap color they are highly aggressive to individuals of their own species but not the other when one species has its dewlap color modified to resemble the other only a relatively minor or no increase in aggression occurs indicating that they still can separate each otherseveral other iguania genera draco otocryptis polychrus sarada and sitana have evolved relatively large movable dewlaps independently of the anoles sexual dimorphism in some anoles the sexes are very similar and difficult to separated under normal viewing conditions but most species exhibit clear sexual dimorphism which allows one to fairly easily discern between adult males and females in a few species the female is slightly larger than the male but in others the sexes are about the same size however in most the males are larger in some more than three times the mass of females this size difference can result in differences in the microhabitat for example males using larger branches than females and feeding males on average eating large prey between the sexes of a single species males of some species have proportionally far longer heads than females but in others it is nearly alike the crest along the nape back tail is larger in the males in species with tall crests this difference can be obvious but in species it is often inconspicuous and easily overlooked especially when not raised the dewlap is often larger in males in some species only the male has a dewlap in a few there are differences in the shape of the nose but this is only known to be prominent in the proboscis and anoles which both have males and more normal looking females it is likely that something similar can be seen in smooth anole but the female of that species is still unknown a less obvious difference between anole sexes is the enlarged scales in malesthe males of many species are overall more brightly colored while females are duller more cryptic and sometimes their upperparts have striped or lined patterns that serve to break up the outline of the anole in general the juvenile colors and pattern resemble those of the adult female the dewlap tends to be more colorful in males with clear differences being common among anoles of the mainland of the americas and comparatively rarer in the caribbean species territoriality and breeding anoles are highly territorial and will fan their dewlap bob their head perform raise their crest and do a wide range of other behaviors to scare away potential competitors if this does not scare off the intruder a fight proceeds in which the two anoles attempt to bite each other during fights some species of anoles are known to vocalize in addition to the behaviors indicating dominance anoles may move their head up and down in a display not to be confused with the display where entire frontal part of body is moved through which is a submissive sign females maintain a feeding territory males maintain a larger breeding territory which overlaps with the feeding territory of one or several females the home range is generally larger in males than in females and larger in large anole species than in smaller in a very small species like the bahoruco anole the home range can be as little is about sq ft and sq ft in a female and male compared to a large species like the knight anole where they average about sq ft and sq ft if removed from its territory an anole will usually be able to find its way back home in a relatively short time but exactly how they do this is unclear being highly solitary animals anoles will only infrequently congregate but in colder regions individuals may rest adjacent to each other in groups during the winterin addition to differences in the appearance of the dewlap the frequency of the dewlap and the frequency and amplitude of the head bobbing differ between species allowing them to separate each other territoriality is typically aimed at other individuals of the same species but in a few cases it is also directed towards other anoles as can be seen between the crested and cook anoles unlike most anoles with widely overlapping ranges these two inhabit very similar niches and directly compete for resources the breeding period varies in species or populations living in highly seasonal regions it is generally relatively short typically during the wet season it is prolonged often even in species or populations living in regions with less distinct seasons in some species where it is the egg production is however higher during the rainy season than the dry season and in many where it is prolonged but not it begins in the spring and ends in the fall males attract and court females by performing a range of behaviors often mirroring those used to scare away competitors including extending their dewlap and bobbing their heads during mating the male inserts one of his hemipenes into the female cloaca fertilizing the egg inside the oviduct the female may mate with multiple males but is also able to store sperm inside her body for fertilization of eggs several months after mating a female anole produces an egg in each ovary meaning that when one is maturing in one of her follicles the yolk of another is forming in the other the white shell only forms when the egg has been fertilized and females will sometimes lay infertile unshelled yellowish eggs known as slugs the female lays one occasionally two eggs per time which typically is placed casually on the ground among under debris logs or rocks or in a small hole in some species it is placed at higher levels in a bromeliad tree hole or rock crevice a small number of species lay their eggs together forming a communal nest among these is the unusual cuban cave anole where as many as eggs may be glued together in a small cavity on the side of a cave wall a nest that contained eggs from the bay anole and the geckos sphaerodactylus armasi and tarentola crombiei represents the only known communal nest for an anole and the only known communal nest involving more than one family of lizard although typically only laying a single egg per time clutch females of many anole species can lay an egg every five days to four weeks some only have a single clutch per year while other species may have as many as on average depending on species anole eggs hatch after about days feeding anoles are opportunistic feeders and may attempt to eat any attractive meal that is of the right size they primarily feed on insects like flies grasshoppers crickets caterpillars moths butterflies beetles and ants and arachnids like spiders several species will also eat small vertebrates such as mice small birds including nestlings lizards including other anole species and cannibalism of their own and frogs the cuban false chameleon anoles chamaeleolis are specialized and a few species like the cuban stream anole may catch prey in water such as shrimp and fish in some species the average varies with the individual anole size age and sex with juvenile anoles eating the smallest prey adult females taking prey and adult males the largest prey in other species there are no clear differences in the preferred prey size regardless of an individual size and sexhunting is done by sight and they generally show a strong preference for moving prey over many will chase down or sneak up to a potential prey item while others are predators that pounce on prey when it gets close to the anole anoles have numerous small sharp and pointed teeth that allow them to efficiently grab their prey they are heterodonts with each tooth in the frontal half of the jaw having a single tip unicuspid and each in the rear half having three tips tricuspid one in the middle and a smaller behind and in front of it unusually the cuban false chameleon anoles have enlarged and blunt teeth in the rear part of their jaw allowing them to crush the shells of their snail preyin addition to animal prey many anole species will take plant material notably fruits flowers and nectar and overall they are best described as omnivorous some species like the knight anole may function as seed dispersers anoles have been recorded drinking sweetened water from hummingbird feeders anoles are vulnerable to drying out and generally need access to water for drinking like dew or rain on leaves although some species are less susceptible to water loss than others and are able to live in relatively arid places predator avoidance and deterrence a wide range of animals will eat anoles such as large spiders centipedes predatory katydids snakes large frogs lizards birds monkeys and carnivoran mammals at least in part of their range snakes may be the most significant predator of anoles for example the caribbean alsophis and borikenophis racers and the mexican central american and south american oxybelis vine snakes feed mostly on lizards like anoles some snakes have a specialized venom that has little effect on humans but it rapidly kills an anole on some caribbean islands anoles make up as much as of the diet of american kestrels large anoles may eat smaller individuals of other anole species and smaller individuals of their own also widespread there is a documented case of a small anole being captured and killed by an outside potted venus flytrap plantanoles mainly detect potential enemies by sight but their hearing range also closely matches the typical vocal range of birds if hearing a predatory bird like a kestrel or hawk they increase their vigilance when hearing a bird little or no change happens most anole species will try to escape from a predator by rapidly running or climbing away but some will move to the opposite side of a tree trunk facing away from the attacker jump to the ground from their perch or freeze when disturbed hoping the adversary does not spot it some anole species will show their fitness by displaying their dewlap when encountering a predator the greater the endurance of the anole the greater the display conversely when suddenly forced to share their habitat with an efficient anole predator like the northern lizard for example if it is introduced to a place where formerly not present the anoles may decrease the amplitude of their head bobbing making them less conspicuous and may become slower to emerge from hiding less willing to take a risk after having been scared by a predator anoles like the twig ecomorphs of the caribbean and many dactyloa species of mainland central and south america are generally cryptically colored and often coordinate their movements with the wind resembling the surrounding vegetation a few species will attempt to escape from predators by diving into water or running bipedally across it similar to basilisks however the anoles lack the specialized toe fringes that helps basilisks when doing this anole tails often have the ability to break off at special segments which is known as autotomy the tail continues to wriggle for a period after detaching attracting the attention of the predator and commonly allowing the anole to escape the tail is regenerated but it takes more than two months to complete this process about two dozen anoles including almost all members of the latifrons species group all in the chamaeleonides species group and the la palma anole do not have the ability to autotomize the tailif caught or cornered anoles will bite in this can be relatively effective against some predators when fighting back and biting sometimes for as much as minutes puerto rican crested anoles escape from more than of all attacks by puerto rican racer snakes some species of anoles will vocalize typically rowls chirps or squeals when caught evolution the evolution of anoles has been widely studied and they have been described as a textbook example of adaptive radiation and convergent evolution especially the widespread convergent evolution seen in anoles living in the greater antilles has attracted the attention of scientists and resulted in comparisons with the darwin finches of the galapagos islands lemurs of madagascar and cichlid fish in the african great lakes ecomorphs and origin on each major greater antillean island cuba hispaniola puerto rico and jamaica there are anole species that have adapted to specific niches and are referred to as ecomorphs crown giant trunk crown trunk trunk ground twig and grass bush a few additional less widely used ecomorphs also exist however even within the greater antilles there are differences depending on island size and the amount of available habitats the largest cuba and hispaniola have all six primary ecomorphs while the smaller puerto rico and jamaica have five and four respectively species living in a specific niche on each island tend to resemble each other in both appearance and behavior for example the escambray twig anole of cuba closely resembles the puerto rican twig and jamaican twig anoles as well as several species of twig ecomorphs from hispaniola despite this they are not closely related and have adapted to their specific niche independently of each other at least four of the six primary ecomorphs are of ancient origin as they have been documented in amber fossils from hispaniola that are about million years old the two missing ecomorphs are crown giant and grass bush otherwise there are few known fossils but early phylogenetic and immunological studies indicate that anoles originated million years ago first inhabitant central or south america and then came to the caribbean initially likely cuba or hispaniola a more recent phylogenetic study published in indicated that anoles originated in south america and diverged from other reptiles far earlier about million years ago while a south american origin has been generally accepted the very high age has been controversial and other studies published in arrived at a lower age estimating that anoles diverged from other reptiles or million years ago while a comprehensive study from estimated about million years ago this indicates that early anoles arrived on the greater antillean islands in the caribbean from the mainland of the americas via rafting rather than overland via ancient now submerged land bridges after arriving in the caribbean they diversified into several new groups and one of these the norops lineage later made its way back to mainland of the americas species and adaptability species level evolution in anoles can be very slow martinique originally consisted of four tiny islands which then merged into a single as a result of uplifting anoles lived on each of the tiny ancient islands and were isolated six to eight million years ago despite this long separation they did not experience allopatric speciation as mixed couples of the different martinique anole populations can successfully reproduce and remain part of a single species the barbados anole is part of the same group but barbados remains a separate isolated island the genetic divergence between the different martinique anole populations is similar to that between other lesser antillean anoles consistently recognized as separate species another lesser antillean species the guadeloupean anole has several distinct populations that generally are recognized as subspecies however guadeloupean anoles exhibit high individual variability and the populations widely intergrade something that possibly has been enhanced by habitat changes by humans allowing populations to easier come into contact with each other and translocations of individuals this indicates that the subspecies are invalid today genetic studies confirm that strong assortative mating between the different guadeloupean anole populations does not exist despite their distinct differences in appearance and them having separated about years ago confidence interval starting at years hybridization between different anole species has rarely been documentedin contrast to this anoles can change rapidly in response to changes and they are one of the few known examples of visible evolution ie where changes happen at a speed where they can be observed within a human lifetime together with groups like stickleback fish guppies and peromyscus beach mice in studies of brown anoles introduced to florida it has been seen that they can become in a single generation when living with the predatory northern lizard anoles are slower and easier to catch for the lizard over a longer period however their legs become shorter which are better suited for perching on smaller branches higher off the ground out of reach for the lizard when brown anoles are introduced to small islands with low vegetation their legs become shorter better suited for rapidly moving among the shrunken shrubbery to catch insects and avoid predatory birds furthermore in a study where brown anoles were introduced to seven small bahaman islands anoles had disappeared because of hurricane frances it was seen all populations became within a few was proportional to the of the founders in other words the few founder brown anoles introduced to one island were than the few introduced to another both populations became over time but the first remained than the second this is an example of the founder effect similarly when brown anoles were introduced to florida the native carolina or green anoles moved to higher perches and gained larger toe pads better suited for those perches this adaptation occurred in just generations anoles are also adapting to life with humans puerto rican crested anoles living in cities have developed more adhesive lamellae on their toe pads than ones living in forests reflecting the need for being able to climb very smooth surfaces like windows in the former habitat in contrast to these fast changes anole adaptability to temperature changes has traditionally been considered relatively minor nevertheless when puerto rican crested anoles in florida where introduced in the were compared to the original native population in puerto rico it was discovered that the former had become adapted to colder temperatures by about an even faster adaption was observed in carolina anoles from texas during the unusually cold winter of carolina anoles living in central texas and further north were already adapted to relatively cold temperatures but those of southern texas were not however after the winter of the cold tolerance of the southern texan populations had increased by as much as and their genomic profiles had changed to more closely resemble the more northerly living carolina anoles taxonomy the name for this group of lizards originates from the carib anoli it was modified and used in french creole and then transferred to english via the genus name anolis coined by french zoologist francois marie daudin in family names have been used for the anoles in recent decades initially they were placed in iguanidae this family then comprising several very different groups was split into eight families in with anoles being part of polychrotidae together with polychrus bush anoles however genetic studies have shown that polychrus is closer to hoplocercidae than the true anoles the true anoles are closer to corytophanidae basilisks and relatives the true anoles have therefore been transferred to their own family dactyloidae alternatively listed as subfamily dactyloinae of family iguanidae the name anolidae cope has sometimes been used but it is a junior synonym of dactyloidae fitzinger more than species of true anoles are known new species are regularly described including in alone most of the recent discoveries have been from the mainland of the americas with fewer new anoles described from the comparatively caribbean islands genera traditionally all the true anoles were included in the genus anolis and some continue to use this treatment in which case it is the largest genus of reptile an attempt of dividing this huge genus was already made in when they were placed in two major groups the alpha anoles comprising most anole subgroups and beta anoles equalling today norops in the following decades other changes were recommended this included a proposal to recognize four genera anolis chamaeleolis chamaelinorops and phenacosaurus in in it was proposed that eight should be recognized the four from and ctenonotus dactyloa norops and semiurus the last was later replaced by its senior synonym xiphosurus these changes were adopted by some and rejected by others who continued placing all in anolis in the first comprehensive molecular studies of the anoles were published confirming the earlier suspicion that the beta anoles are a monophyletic group but the alpha anoles are not furthermore the genus splits proposed in and caused problems as the narrowly defined anolis was not monophyletic in a major review based on several types of data both molecular and morphological revealed several groups and partially confirmed the genetic results from no major changes were proposed and all anoles were maintained in a broadly defined anolis two recent studies primarily genetic and published in and confirmed several of the groups found in earlier studies but rejected others they found that the anoles fall into eight primary clades some of these can be further subdivided for example chamaeleolis from cuba is one of two subclades within xiphosurus and it is sometimes considered a valid genus in which case xiphosurus is restricted to hispaniola puerto rico and nearby smaller islands in contrast the earlier proposed genus phenacosaurus from the andes and tepui highlands in northwestern south america is now included in dactyloa the phylogenetic position of most species is clear but in a few the available evidence is conflicting labelled with considerable statistic uncertaintythe relationship of dactyloidae can be described with a cladogram whether the eight groups are best recognized as separate genera or only as clades within a single genus anolis is disputed a few families between polychrotidae and are not shown relationship with humans anoles are model organisms often studied in fields such as ecology behavior physiology and evolution the carolina or green anole is the anole species with the earliest dedicated studies being more than years old from the late the carolina anole was the first reptile where the entire genome was sequencedanoles are harmless to humans but if caught or cornered they will bite in as typical of animals the bite force is strongly correlated to the size of the anole it causes little pain in the smaller anoles which usually do not break the skin large species have relatively strong jaws lined with small sharp teeth and their bite can be painful and result in a superficial wound but it is still essentially harmlesssome anole species are commonly kept in captivity as pets and especially the carolina or green anole is often described as a good beginner reptile but it too requires specialized careanoles can function as a biological pest control by eating pest insects that may harm humans or plants anole abundances can be considerably higher in diversified agroecosystems multiple different plant types than agroecosystems typically only one or very few plant types and regular use of agrochemicals making the former particularly suitable for this type of pest control however because of their potential of becoming invasive species releasing anoles outside their native range is strongly discouraged and often illegal even if the species occurs elsewhere in a country for example it is illegal to release carolina anoles in california as its native range is in southeastern united states conservation the willingness of many anoles of living close to humans in heavily altered habitats have made them common some anoles can occur in very high densities as illustrated by the saint vincent bush puerto rican bush and spotted anoles where it has been estimated that there locally are almost individuals per hectare per acre in the first species and at least per hectare per acre in the last two however in most species the density is lower and in rare anoles it is can be well below individuals per hectare per acre some are restricted to specific habitats such as primary rainforest making them more vulnerable in a review in it was found that more than anole species had a known total range that covered sq mi or less around their type locality as of april only anoles equalling less than of the total number of recognized species had been rated by the iucn most of these are either least concern not threatened or data deficient limited available data prevents an assessment but are considered vulnerable endangered and critically endangered typical threats to these are habitat loss from both humans and extreme weather or by introduced species for example the finca ceres anole a critically endangered species only known from a single unprotected location in matanzas province cuba has suffered habitat loss both due to hurricanes and expanding agricultural land a amplisquamosus an endangered species only known from highland forest in the cusuco national park region of honduras was common in the early but by it had experienced a drastic decline and was only infrequently encountered a clear explanation for this is lacking although it may be related to habitat loss due to human development and agriculture similarly a landestoyi which only was described in and has not been rated by the iucn is restricted to the loma charco azul reserve in hispaniola but it is seriously threatened by continuing illegal habitat destruction by agriculture livestock grazing and production of wood charcoal another example of a species that has not been rated by the iucn is the strikingly colored blue anole from colombia gorgona island it is threatened from deforestation and predation by the introduced western basilisks certain highly localized species can be threatened by other anoles the cook anole found only in southwestern puerto rico and considered endangered by the puerto rico department of natural and environmental resources faces habitat loss and fragmentation from human development predation by introduced species especially cats and rats and direct competition from a more widespread native the puerto rican crested anole the puerto rican crested anole has also been introduced to dominica where it locally is outcompeting the endemic dominican anole having already largely displaced the south caribbean ecotype traditionally subspecies anolis o oculatus which possibly may require a captive breeding program to ensure its survivalnevertheless anoles overall do not appear to have experienced the widespread extinctions and extirpations prevalent among larger caribbean reptiles the culebra island giant anole is the only anole considered possibly extinct in recent history other extinct anoles are prehistoric and only known from fossil remains that are millions of years old locals reported sighting of the culebra island giant anole as recent as the but this likely involved misidentifications of young green iguanas others at least the morne constant anole do not grow as large today as they once didspecies restricted to a specific habitat in relatively remote regions infrequently visited by biologists looking for reptiles are often virtually unknown and rarely recorded in a review in it was found that anole species only were known from their holotype these may truly be rare and seriously threatened as the proboscis anole a species that only was known from a single specimen collected in until it was rediscovered in cloud forests of ecuador in in others with few records like the neblina anole this is not the case it was initially known from six specimens from the remote neblina highlands in venezuela but when the brazilian part of these highlands were visited in it was discovered that the species was locally abundant some species are easily overlooked even if common for example if searching for orces andes anole during the night when asleep they can be fairly easy to find but if visiting the same location during the day it can be very difficult to find any as introduced species when introduced to regions outside their native range by humans anoles may become invasive and represent a serious threat to small local animals such introductions may happen by mistake for example as stowaways on garden plants or deliberately as predators introduced to combat insects or release of pet anoles people no longer want in the contiguous united states the carolina anole has been introduced to california the brown anole has been introduced to the gulf coast states and california and the knight jamaican giant bark puerto rican crested cuban green and hispaniolan green anoles have been introduced to florida the barbados and morne constant anoles have also been recorded in florida but do not appear to have become established there are indications that the invasive brown anole is displacing the native carolina anole in florida and texas by outcompeting it and eating its young in the most disturbed habitats the carolina anole may disappear entirely but in less disturbed habitats where there is more cover allowing young to avoid predation it may remain fairly common although it is forced to occur higher in trees where less visible to humans regardless the carolina anole is common and widespread overall and it has itself been introduced to several regions outside its native range including california kansas hawaii guam palau the bahamas cayman islands anguilla belize tamaulipas in mexico and japan okinawa and ogasawara bonin islands although there are several records from spain both the mainland and the canary islands none of these have become established in japan ogasawara islands the introduced carolina anoles have caused declines in native lizards and diurnal insects including the of the endemic celastrina ogasawaraensis butterfly and five dragonfly species this may be due to the ecological naivete of the insects before the introduction there were no diurnal highly arboreal lizards
