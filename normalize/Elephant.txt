elephants are mammals of the family elephantidae and the largest existing land animals three species are currently recognised the african bush elephant the african forest elephant and the asian elephant elephantidae is the only surviving family of the order proboscidea extinct members include the mastodons the family elephantidae also contains several groups including the mammoths and elephants african elephants have larger ears and concave backs whereas asian elephants have smaller ears and convex or level backs distinctive features of all elephants include a long trunk tusks large ear flaps massive legs and tough but sensitive skin the trunk also called a proboscis is used for breathing bringing food and water to the mouth and grasping objects tusks which are derived from the incisor teeth serve both as weapons and as tools for moving objects and digging the large ear flaps assist in maintaining a constant body temperature as well as in communication the legs carry their great weight elephants are scattered throughout africa south asia and southeast asia and are found in different habitats including savannahs forests deserts and marshes they are herbivorous and they stay near water when it is accessible they are considered to be keystone species due to their impact on their environments other animals tend to keep their distance from elephants the exception is their predators such as lions tigers hyenas and wild dogs which usually target only young elephants calves elephants have a society in which multiple family groups come together to socialise females cows tend to live in family groups which can consist of one female with her calves or several related females with offspring the groups which do not include bulls are led by the usually oldest cow known as the matriarch males bulls leave their family groups when they reach puberty and may live alone or with other males adult bulls mostly interact with family groups when looking for a mate they enter a state of increased testosterone and aggression known as musth which helps them gain dominance over other males as well as reproductive success calves are the centre of attention in their family groups and rely on their mothers for as long as three years elephants can live up to years in the wild they communicate by touch sight smell and sound elephants use infrasound and seismic communication over long distances elephant intelligence has been compared with that of primates and cetaceans they appear to have as well as appearing to show empathy for dying and dead family members african elephants are listed as vulnerable and asian elephants as endangered by the international union for conservation of nature iucn one of the biggest threats to elephant populations is the ivory trade as the animals are poached for their ivory tusks other threats to wild elephants include habitat destruction and conflicts with local people elephants are used as working animals in asia in the past they were used in war today they are often controversially put on display in zoos or exploited for entertainment in circuses elephants are highly recognisable and have been featured in art folklore religion literature and popular culture etymology the word elephant is based on the latin elephas genitive elephantis elephant which is the latinised form of the greek elephas elephas genitive elephantos elephantos probably from a language likely phoenician it is attested in mycenaean greek as genitive in linear b syllabic script as in mycenaean greek homer used the greek word to mean ivory but after the time of herodotus it also referred to the animal the word elephant appears in middle english as olyfaunt and was borrowed from old french oliphant century taxonomy and phylogeny elephants belong to the family elephantidae the sole remaining family within the order proboscidea which belongs to the superorder afrotheria their closest extant relatives are the sirenians dugongs and manatees and the hyraxes with which they share the clade paenungulata within the superorder afrotheria elephants and sirenians are further grouped in the clade tethytheriathree species of elephants are recognised the african bush elephant loxodonta africana and forest elephant loxodonta cyclotis of africa and the asian elephant elephas maximus of south and southeast asia african elephants have larger ears a concave back more wrinkled skin a sloping abdomen and two extensions at the tip of the trunk asian elephants have smaller ears a convex or level back smoother skin a horizontal abdomen that occasionally sags in the middle and one extension at the tip of the trunk the looped ridges on the molars are narrower in the asian elephant while those of the african are more the asian elephant also has dorsal bumps on its head and some patches of depigmentation on its skinamong african elephants forest elephants have smaller and more rounded ears and thinner and straighter tusks than bush elephants and are limited in range to the forested areas of western and central africa both kinds of elephant were traditionally considered to be the same species loxodonta africana but molecular studies have affirmed their status as separate species in dna sequence analysis showed that l cyclotis is more closely related to the extinct palaeoloxodon antiquus than it is to l africana possibly undermining the genus loxodonta as a whole evolution and extinct relatives over extinct members and three major evolutionary radiations of the order proboscidea have been recorded the earliest proboscids the african eritherium and phosphatherium of the late paleocene heralded the first radiation the eocene included numidotherium moeritherium and barytherium from africa these animals were relatively small and aquatic later on genera such as phiomia and palaeomastodon arose the latter likely inhabited forests and open woodlands proboscidean diversity declined during the oligocene one notable species of this epoch was eritreum melakeghebrekristosi of the horn of africa which may have been an ancestor to several later species the beginning of the miocene saw the second diversification with the appearance of the deinotheres and the mammutids the former were related to barytherium and lived in africa and eurasia while the latter may have descended from eritreum and spread to north americathe second radiation was represented by the emergence of the gomphotheres in the miocene which likely evolved from eritreum and originated in africa spreading to every continent except australia and antarctica members of this group included gomphotherium and platybelodon the third radiation started in the late miocene and led to the arrival of the elephantids which descended from and slowly replaced the gomphotheres the african primelephas gomphotheroides gave rise to loxodonta mammuthus and elephas loxodonta branched off earliest around the miocene and pliocene boundary while mammuthus and elephas diverged later during the early pliocene loxodonta remained in africa while mammuthus and elephas spread to eurasia and the former reached north america at the same time the stegodontids another proboscidean group descended from gomphotheres spread throughout asia including the indian subcontinent china southeast asia and japan mammutids continued to evolve into new species such as the american mastodonat the beginning of the pleistocene elephantids experienced a high rate of speciation the pleistocene also saw the arrival of palaeoloxodon namadicus the largest terrestrial mammal of all time loxodonta atlantica became the most common species in northern and southern africa but was replaced by elephas iolensis later in the pleistocene only when elephas disappeared from africa did loxodonta become dominant once again this time in the form of the modern species elephas diversified into new species in asia such as e hysudricus and e platycephus the latter the likely ancestor of the modern asian elephant mammuthus evolved into several species including the woolly mammoth interbreeding appears to have been common among elephantid species which in some cases led to species with three ancestral genetic components such as the palaeoloxodon antiquus in the late pleistocene most proboscidean species vanished during the quaternary glaciation which killed off of genera weighing over kg lb worldwideproboscideans experienced several evolutionary trends such as an increase in size which led to many giant species that stood up to cm ft in tall as with other megaherbivores including the extinct sauropod dinosaurs the large size of elephants likely developed to allow them to survive on vegetation with low nutritional value their limbs grew longer and the feet shorter and broader the feet were originally plantigrade and developed into a digitigrade stance with cushion pads and the sesamoid bone providing support early proboscideans developed longer mandibles and smaller craniums while more derived ones developed shorter mandibles which shifted the head centre of gravity the skull grew larger especially the cranium while the neck shortened to provide better support for the skull the increase in size led to the development and elongation of the mobile trunk to provide reach the number of premolars incisors and canines decreased the cheek teeth molars and premolars became larger and more specialized especially after elephants started to switch from to which caused their teeth to undergo a increase in teeth height as well as substantial multiplication of lamellae after about five million years ago only in the last million years or so did they return to a diet mainly consisting of trees and shrubs the upper second incisors grew into tusks which varied in shape from straight to curved either upward or downward to spiralled depending on the species some proboscideans developed tusks from their lower incisors elephants retain certain features from their aquatic ancestry such as their middle ear anatomy dwarf species several species of proboscideans lived on islands and experienced insular dwarfism this occurred primarily during the pleistocene when some elephant populations became isolated by fluctuating sea levels although dwarf elephants did exist earlier in the pliocene these elephants likely grew smaller on islands due to a lack of large or viable predator populations and limited resources by contrast small mammals such as rodents develop gigantism in these conditions dwarf proboscideans are known to have lived in indonesia the channel islands of california and several islands of the mediterraneanelephas celebensis of sulawesi is believed to have descended from elephas planifrons palaeoloxodon falconeri of malta and sicily was only cm ft in and had probably evolved from the elephant other descendants of the elephant existed in cyprus dwarf elephants of uncertain descent lived in crete cyclades and dodecanese while dwarf mammoths are known to have lived in sardinia the columbian mammoth colonised the channel islands and evolved into the pygmy mammoth this species reached a height of cm ft ft in and weighed kg lb a population of small woolly mammoths survived on wrangel island now km mi north of the siberian coast as recently as years ago after their discovery in they were considered dwarf mammoths this classification has been and since the second international mammoth conference in these animals are no longer considered to be true dwarf mammoths characteristics size elephants are the largest living terrestrial animals african bush elephants are the largest species with males being cm ft ft in tall at the shoulder with a body mass of t short tons and females standing cm ft ft in tall at the shoulder with a body mass of t short tons male asian elephants are usually about cm ft ft in tall at the shoulder and t short tons whereas females are cm ft ft in tall at the shoulder and t short tons african forest elephants are the smallest species with males usually being around cm ft ft in tall at the shoulder and t short tons male african bush elephants are typically taller than females whereas male asian elephants are only around taller than females bones the skeleton of the elephant is made up of bones the vertebrae are connected by tight joints which limit the backbone flexibility african elephants have pairs of ribs while asian elephants have or pairs head an elephant skull is resilient enough to withstand the forces generated by the leverage of the tusks and collisions the back of the skull is flattened and spread out creating arches that protect the brain in every direction the skull contains air cavities sinuses that reduce the weight of the skull while maintaining overall strength these cavities give the inside of the skull a appearance the cranium is particularly large and provides enough room for the attachment of muscles to support the entire head the lower jaw is solid and heavy because of the size of the head the neck is relatively short to provide better support lacking a lacrimal apparatus the eye relies on the harderian gland to keep it moist a durable nictitating membrane protects the eye globe the animal field of vision is compromised by the location and limited mobility of the eyes elephants are considered dichromats and they can see well in dim light but not in bright light the core body temperature averages similar to that of a human like all mammals an elephant can raise or lower its temperature a few degrees from the average in response to extreme environmental conditions ears elephant ears have thick bases with thin tips the ear flaps or pinnae contain numerous blood vessels called capillaries warm blood flows into the capillaries helping to release excess body heat into the environment this occurs when the pinnae are still and the animal can enhance the effect by flapping them larger ear surfaces contain more capillaries and more heat can be released of all the elephants african bush elephants live in the hottest climates and have the largest ear flaps elephants are capable of hearing at low frequencies and are most sensitive at khz in close proximity to the soprano c trunk the trunk or proboscis is a fusion of the nose and upper lip although in early fetal life the upper lip and trunk are separated the trunk is elongated and specialised to become the elephant most important and versatile appendage it contains up to separate muscle fascicles with no bone and little fat these paired muscles consist of two major types superficial surface and internal the former are divided into dorsals ventrals and laterals while the latter are divided into transverse and radiating muscles the muscles of the trunk connect to a bony opening in the skull the nasal septum is composed of tiny muscle units that stretch horizontally between the nostrils cartilage divides the nostrils at the base as a muscular hydrostat the trunk moves by precisely coordinated muscle contractions the muscles work both with and against each other a unique proboscis nerve formed by the maxillary and facial nerves runs along both sides of the trunkelephant trunks have multiple functions including breathing olfaction touching grasping and sound production the animal sense of smell may be four times as sensitive as that of a bloodhound the trunk ability to make powerful twisting and coiling movements allows it to collect food wrestle with other elephants and lift up to kg lb it can be used for delicate tasks such as wiping an eye and checking an orifice and is capable of cracking a peanut shell without breaking the seed with its trunk an elephant can reach items at heights of up to m ft and dig for water under mud or sand individuals may show lateral preference when grasping with their trunks some prefer to twist them to the left others to the right elephants can suck up water both to drink and to spray on their bodies an adult asian elephant is capable of holding l us gal of water in its trunk they will also spray dust or grass on themselves when underwater the elephant uses its trunk as a snorkelthe african elephant has two extensions at the tip of the trunk that allow it to grasp and bring food to its mouth the asian elephant has only one and relies more on wrapping around a food item and squeezing it into its mouth asian elephants have more muscle coordination and can perform more complex tasks losing the trunk would be detrimental to an elephant survival although in rare cases individuals have survived with shortened ones one elephant has been observed to graze by kneeling on its front legs raising on its hind legs and taking in grass with its lips floppy trunk syndrome is a condition of trunk paralysis in african bush elephants caused by the degradation of the peripheral nerves and muscles beginning at the tip teeth elephants usually have teeth the incisors known as the tusks deciduous premolars and molars unlike most mammals which grow baby teeth and then replace them with a single permanent set of adult teeth elephants are polyphyodonts that have cycles of tooth rotation throughout their lives the chewing teeth are replaced six times in a typical elephant lifetime teeth are not replaced by new ones emerging from the jaws vertically as in most mammals instead new teeth grow in at the back of the mouth and move forward to push out the old ones the first chewing tooth on each side of the jaw falls out when the elephant is two to three years old the second set of chewing teeth falls out at four to six years old the third set falls out at years of age and set four lasts until years of age the fifth set of teeth falls out at the early the sixth and usually final set must last the elephant the rest of its life elephant teeth have dental ridges which are thicker and more in african elephants tusks the tusks of an elephant are modified second incisors in the upper jaw they replace deciduous milk teeth at months of age and grow continuously at about cm in a year a newly developed tusk has a smooth enamel cap that eventually wears off the dentine is known as ivory and its consists of crisscrossing line patterns known as engine turning which create areas as a piece of living tissue a tusk is relatively soft it is as hard as the mineral calcite much of the tusk can be seen outside the rest is in a socket in the skull at least of the tusk contains the pulp and some have nerves stretching to the tip thus it would be difficult to remove it without harming the animal when removed ivory begins to dry up and crack if not kept cool and moist tusks serve multiple purposes they are used for digging for water salt and roots debarking or marking trees and for moving trees and branches when clearing a path when fighting they are used to attack and defend and to protect the trunklike humans who are typically or elephants are usually or the dominant tusk called the master tusk is generally more worn down as it is shorter with a rounder tip for the african elephants tusks are present in both males and females and are around the same length in both sexes reaching up to cm ft in but those of males tend to be thicker in earlier times elephant tusks weighing over pounds more than kg were not uncommon though it is rare today to see any over pounds kg in the asian species only the males have large tusks female asians have very small tusks or none at all tuskless males exist and are particularly common among sri lankan elephants asian males can have tusks as long as africans but they are usually slimmer and lighter the largest recorded was cm ft in long and weighed kg lb hunting for elephant ivory in africa and asia has led to natural selection for shorter tusks and tusklessness skin an elephant skin is generally very tough at cm in thick on the back and parts of the head the skin around the mouth anus and inside of the ear is considerably thinner elephants typically have grey skin but african elephants look brown or reddish after wallowing in coloured mud asian elephants have some patches of depigmentation particularly on the forehead and ears and the areas around them calves have brownish or reddish hair especially on the head and back as elephants mature their hair darkens and becomes sparser but dense concentrations of hair and bristles remain on the end of the tail as well as the chin genitals and the areas around the eyes and ear openings normally the skin of an asian elephant is covered with more hair than its african counterpartan elephant uses mud as a sunscreen protecting its skin from ultraviolet light although tough an elephant skin is very sensitive without regular mud baths to protect it from burning insect bites and moisture loss an elephant skin suffers serious damage after bathing the elephant will usually use its trunk to blow dust onto its body and this dries into a protective crust elephants have difficulty releasing heat through the skin because of their low ratio which is many times smaller than that of a human they have even been observed lifting up their legs presumably in an effort to expose their soles to the air legs locomotion and posture to support the animal weight an elephant limbs are positioned more vertically under the body than in most other mammals the long bones of the limbs have cancellous bone in place of medullary cavities this strengthens the bones while still allowing haematopoiesis both the front and hind limbs can support an elephant weight although is borne by the front since the limb bones are placed on top of each other and under the body an elephant can stand still for long periods of time without using much energy elephants are incapable of rotating their front legs as the ulna and radius are fixed in pronation the palm of the manus faces backward the pronator quadratus and the pronator teres are either reduced or absent the circular feet of an elephant have soft tissues or cushion pads beneath the manus or pes which distribute the weight of the animal they appear to have a sesamoid an extra toe similar in placement to a giant panda extra thumb that also helps in weight distribution as many as five toenails can be found on both the front and hind feetelephants can move both forwards and backwards but can not trot jump or gallop they use only two gaits when moving on land the walk and a faster gait similar to running in walking the legs act as pendulums with the hips and shoulders rising and falling while the foot is planted on the ground with no aerial phase the fast gait does not meet all the criteria of running although the elephant uses its legs much like other running animals with the hips and shoulders falling and then rising while the feet are on the ground elephants appear to with their front legs but with their hind legs and can reach a top speed of mph at this speed most other quadrupeds are well into a gallop even accounting for leg length kinetics could explain the difference between the motion of elephants and other animals during locomotion the cushion pads expand and contract and reduce both the pain and noise that would come from a very heavy animal moving elephants are capable swimmers they have been recorded swimming for up to six hours without touching the bottom and have travelled as far as km mi at a stretch and at speeds of up to mph organs the brain of an elephant weighs kg lb compared to kg lb for a human brain while the elephant brain is larger overall it is proportionally smaller at birth an elephant brain already weighs of its adult weight the cerebrum and cerebellum are well developed and the temporal lobes are so large that they bulge out laterally the throat of an elephant appears to contain a pouch where it can store water for later use the larynx of the elephant is the largest known among mammals the vocal folds are long and are attached close to the epiglottis base when comparing an elephant vocal folds to those of a human an elephant are longer thicker and have a larger area in addition they are tilted at degrees and positioned more anteriorly than a human vocal foldsthe heart of an elephant weighs kg lb it has a apex an unusual trait among mammals in addition the ventricles separate near the top of the heart a trait they share with sirenians when standing the elephant heart beats approximately times per minute unlike many other animals the heart rate speeds up by to beats per minute when the elephant is lying down the blood vessels in most of the body are wide and thick and can withstand high blood pressures the lungs are attached to the diaphragm and breathing relies mainly on the diaphragm rather than the expansion of the ribcage connective tissue exists in place of the pleural cavity this may allow the animal to deal with the pressure differences when its body is underwater and its trunk is breaking the surface for air although this explanation has been questioned another possible function for this adaptation is that it helps the animal suck up water through the trunk elephants inhale mostly through the trunk although some air goes through the mouth they have a hindgut fermentation system and their large and small intestines together reach m ft in length the majority of an elephant food intake goes undigested despite the process lasting up to a daya male elephant testes are located internally near the kidneys the elephant penis can reach a length of cm in and a diameter of cm in at the base it is when fully erect and has a orifice the female has a clitoris at up to cm in the vulva is located between the hind legs instead of near the tail as in most mammals determining pregnancy status can be difficult due to the animal large abdominal cavity the female mammary glands occupy the space between the front legs which puts the suckling calf within reach of the female trunk elephants have a unique organ the temporal gland located in both sides of the head this organ is associated with sexual behaviour and males secrete a fluid from it when in musth females have also been observed with secretions from the temporal glands core body temperature the core body temperature averages similar to that of a human like all mammals an elephant can raise or lower its temperature a few degrees from the average in response to extreme environmental conditions behaviour and life history ecology and activities the african bush elephant can be found in habitats as diverse as dry savannahs deserts marshes and lake shores and in elevations from sea level to mountain areas above the snow line forest elephants mainly live in equatorial forests but will enter gallery forests and ecotones between forests and savannahs asian elephants prefer areas with a mix of grasses low woody plants and trees primarily inhabiting dry forests in southern india and sri lanka and evergreen forests in malaya elephants are herbivorous and will eat leaves twigs fruit bark grass and roots they are born with sterile intestines and require bacteria obtained from their mother feces to digest vegetation african elephants are mostly browsers while asian elephants are mainly grazers they can consume as much as kg lb of food and l us gal of water in a day elephants tend to stay near water sources major feeding bouts take place in the morning afternoon and night at midday elephants rest under trees and may doze off while standing sleeping occurs at night while the animal is lying down elephants average hours of sleep per day both males and family groups typically move km mi a day but distances as far as km mi have been recorded in the etosha region of namibia elephants go on seasonal migrations in search of food water minerals and mates at chobe national park botswana herds travel km mi to visit the river when the local waterholes dry upbecause of their large size elephants have a huge impact on their environments and are considered keystone species their habit of uprooting trees and undergrowth can transform savannah into grasslands when they dig for water during drought they create waterholes that can be used by other animals they can enlarge waterholes when they bathe and wallow in them at mount elgon elephants excavate caves that are used by ungulates hyraxes bats birds and insects elephants are important seed dispersers african forest elephants ingest and defecate seeds with either no effect or a positive effect on germination the seeds are typically dispersed in large amounts over great distances in asian forests large seeds require giant herbivores like elephants and rhinoceros for transport and dispersal this ecological niche can not be filled by the next largest herbivore the tapir because most of the food elephants eat goes undigested their dung can provide food for other animals such as dung beetles and monkeys elephants can have a negative impact on ecosystems at murchison falls national park in uganda the overabundance of elephants has threatened several species of small birds that depend on woodlands their weight can compact the soil which causes the rain to run off leading to erosion elephants typically coexist peacefully with other herbivores which will usually stay out of their way some aggressive interactions between elephants and rhinoceros have been recorded at aberdare national park kenya a rhino attacked an elephant calf and was killed by the other elephants in the group at game reserve south africa introduced young orphan elephants went on a killing spree that claimed the lives of rhinos during the but ended with the introduction of older males the size of adult elephants makes them nearly invulnerable to predators though there are rare reports of adult elephants falling prey to tigers calves may be preyed on by lions spotted hyenas and wild dogs in africa and tigers in asia the lions of savuti botswana have adapted to hunting elephants mostly juveniles or during the dry season and a pride of lions has been recorded killing juvenile individuals between the ages of four and eleven years elephants appear to distinguish between the growls of larger predators like tigers and smaller predators like leopards which have not been recorded killing calves they react to leopards less fearfully and more aggressively elephants tend to have high numbers of parasites particularly nematodes compared to other herbivores this is due to lower predation pressures that would otherwise kill off many of the individuals with significant parasite loads social organisation female elephants spend their entire lives in matrilineal family groups some of which are made up of more than ten members including three mothers and their dependent offspring and are led by the matriarch which is often the eldest female she remains leader of the group until death or if she no longer has the energy for the role a study on zoo elephants showed that when the matriarch died the levels of faecal corticosterone hormone dramatically increased in the surviving elephants when her tenure is over the matriarch eldest daughter takes her place this occurs even if her sister is present one study found that younger matriarchs are more likely than older ones to to severe danger family groups may split after becoming too large for the available resourcesthe social circle of the female elephant does not necessarily end with the small family unit in the case of elephants in amboseli national park kenya a female life involves interaction with other families clans and subpopulations families may associate and bond with each other forming what are known as bond groups which typically made of two family groups during the dry season elephant families may cluster together and form another level of social organisation known as the clan groups within these clans do not form strong bonds but they defend their ranges against other clans there are typically nine groups in a clan the amboseli elephant population is further divided into the central and peripheral subpopulationssome elephant populations in india and sri lanka have similar basic social organisations there appear to be cohesive family units and loose aggregations they have been observed to have nursing units and units in southern india elephant populations may contain family groups bond groups and possibly clans family groups tend to be small consisting of one or two adult females and their offspring a group containing more than two adult females plus offspring is known as a joint family malay elephant populations have even smaller family units and do not have any social organisation higher than a family or bond group groups of african forest elephants typically consist of one adult female with one to three offspring these groups appear to interact with each other especially at forest clearingsthe social life of the adult male is very different as he matures a male spends more time at the edge of his group and associates with outside males or even other families at amboseli young males spend over of their time away from their families when they are when males permanently leave they either live alone or with other males the former is typical of bulls in dense forests asian males are usually solitary but occasionally form groups of two or more individuals the largest consisted of seven bulls larger bull groups consisting of over members occur only among african bush elephants the largest of which numbered up to individualsmale elephants can be quite sociable when not competing for dominance or mates and will form relationships a dominance hierarchy exists among males whether they range socially or solitarily dominance depends on the age size and sexual condition and when in groups males follow the lead of the dominant bull young bulls may seek out the company and leadership of older more experienced males whose presence appears to control their aggression and prevent them from exhibiting deviant behaviour adult males and females come together for reproduction bulls associate with family groups if an oestrous cow is present sexual behaviour musth adult males enter a state of increased testosterone known as musth in a population in southern india males first enter musth at the age of but it is not very intense until they are older than at amboseli bulls under do not go into musth while half of those aged and all those over do young bulls appear to enter musth during the dry season while older bulls go through it during the wet season the main characteristic of a bull musth is a fluid secreted from the temporal gland that runs down the side of his face he may urinate with his penis still in his sheath which causes the urine to spray on his hind legs behaviours associated with musth include walking with the head held high and swinging picking at the ground with the tusks marking rumbling and waving only one ear at a time this can last from a day to four monthsmales become extremely aggressive during musth size is the determining factor in agonistic encounters when the individuals have the same condition in contests between musth and individuals musth bulls win the majority of the time even when the bull is larger a male may stop showing signs of musth when he encounters a musth male of higher rank those of equal rank tend to avoid each other agonistic encounters typically consist of threat displays chases and minor sparring with the tusks serious fights are rare mating elephants are polygynous breeders and copulations are most frequent during the peak of the wet season a cow in oestrus releases chemical signals pheromones in her urine and vaginal secretions to signal her readiness to mate a bull will follow a potential mate and assess her condition with the flehmen response which requires the male to collect a chemical sample with his trunk and bring it to the vomeronasal organ the oestrous cycle of a cow lasts weeks with a follicular phase and an to luteal phase while most mammals have one surge of luteinizing hormone during the follicular phase elephants have two the first or anovulatory surge could signal to males that the female is in oestrus by changing her scent but ovulation does not occur until the second or ovulatory surge fertility rates in cows decline around years of agebulls engage in a behaviour known as where they follow oestrous females and defend them from other males most is done by musth males and females actively seek to be guarded by them particularly older ones thus these bulls have more reproductive success musth appears to signal to females the condition of the male as weak or injured males do not have normal musths for young females the approach of an older bull can be intimidating so her relatives stay nearby to provide support and reassurance during copulation the male lays his trunk over the female back the penis is very mobile being able to move independently of the pelvis prior to mounting it curves forward and upward copulation lasts about seconds and does not involve pelvic thrusting or ejaculatory pause elephant sperm must swim close to m ft to reach the egg by comparison human sperm has to swim around only mm in homosexual behaviour is frequent in both sexes as in heterosexual interactions this involves mounting male elephants sometimes stimulate each other by playfighting and championships may form between old bulls and younger males female behaviours have been documented only in captivity where they are known to masturbate one another with their trunks birth and development gestation in elephants typically lasts around two years with interbirth intervals usually lasting four to five years births tend to take place during the wet season calves are born cm in tall and weigh around kg lb typically only a single young is born but twins sometimes occur the relatively long pregnancy is maintained by five corpus luteums as opposed to one in most mammals and gives the foetus more time to develop particularly the brain and trunk as such newborn elephants are precocial and quickly stand and walk to follow their mother and family herd a new calf is usually the centre of attention for herd members adults and most of the other young will gather around the newborn touching and caressing it with their trunks for the first few days the mother is intolerant of other herd members near her young alloparenting where a calf is cared for by someone other than its mother takes place in some family groups allomothers are typically two to twelve years old when a predator is near the family group gathers together with the calves in the centrefor the first few days the newborn is unsteady on its feet and needs the support of its mother it relies on touch smell and hearing as its eyesight is poor it has little precise control over its trunk which wiggles around and may cause it to trip by its second week of life the calf can walk more firmly and has more control over its trunk after its first month a calf can pick up hold and put objects in its mouth but can not suck water through the trunk and must drink directly through the mouth it is still dependent on its mother and keeps close to herfor its first three months a calf relies entirely on milk from its mother for nutrition after which it begins to forage for vegetation and can use its trunk to collect water at the same time improvements in lip and leg coordination occur calves continue to suckle at the same rate as before until their sixth month after which they become more independent when feeding by nine months mouth trunk and foot coordination is perfected after a year a calf abilities to groom drink and feed itself are fully developed it still needs its mother for nutrition and protection from predators for at least another year suckling bouts tend to last for a calf younger than a year and it continues to suckle until it reaches three years of age or older suckling after two years may serve to maintain growth rate body condition and reproductive abilityplay behaviour in calves differs between the sexes females run or chase each other while males the former are sexually mature by the age of nine years while the latter become mature around years adulthood starts at about years of age in both sexes elephants have long lifespans reaching years of age lin wang a captive male asian elephant lived for years communication touching is an important form of communication among elephants individuals greet each other by stroking or wrapping their trunks the latter also occurs during mild competition older elephants use kicks and shoves to discipline younger ones individuals of any age and sex will touch each other mouths temporal glands and genitals particularly during meetings or when excited this allows individuals to pick up chemical cues touching is especially important for communication when moving elephant mothers will touch their calves with their trunks or feet when or with their tails if the calf is behind them if a calf wants to rest it will press against its mother front legs and when it wants to suckle it will touch her breast or legvisual displays mostly occur in agonistic situations elephants will try to appear more threatening by raising their heads and spreading their ears they may add to the display by shaking their heads and snapping their ears as well as throwing dust and vegetation they are usually bluffing when performing these actions excited elephants may raise their trunks submissive ones will lower their heads and trunks as well as flatten their ears against their necks while those that accept a challenge will position their ears in a v shapeelephants produce several sounds usually through the larynx though some may be modified by the trunk perhaps the most well known call is the trumpet which is made by blowing through the trunk trumpeting is made during excitement distress or aggression fighting elephants may roar or squeal and wounded ones may bellow rumbles are produced during mild arousal and some appear to be infrasonic these calls occur at frequencies less than hz infrasonic calls are important particularly for communication in both asian and african elephants for asian elephants these calls have a frequency of hz with sound pressure levels of db and last seconds for african elephants calls range from hz with sound pressure levels as high as db allowing communication for many kilometres with a possible maximum range of around km mi from various experiments the elephant larynx is shown to produce various and complex vibratory phenomena during in vivo situations these phenomena could be triggered when the vocal folds and vocal tract interact to raise or lower the fundamental frequency one of the vibratory phenomena that occurred inside the larynx is alternating and traveling waves which happened due to the unusual larynx layout this can be characterized by its unique glottal pattern when the trachea is at pressure of approximately kpa phonation begins in the larynx and the laryngeal tissue starts to vibrate at approximately kpa vocal production mechanisms at certain frequencies are similar to that of humans and other mammals and the laryngeal tissues are subjected to oscillations two biomechanical features can trigger these traveling wave patterns which are a low fundamental frequency and in the vocal folds increasing longitudinal tensionat amboseli several different infrasonic calls have been identified a greeting rumble is emitted by members of a family group after having been separated for several hours contact calls are soft unmodulated sounds made by individuals that have been separated from their group and may be responded to with a contact answer call that starts out loud but becomes softer a let go soft rumble is emitted by the matriarch to signal to the other herd members that it is time to move to another spot bulls in musth emit a distinctive pulsated rumble nicknamed the motorcycle musth rumbles may be answered by the female chorus a modulated chorus produced by several cows a loud postcopulatory call may be made by an oestrous cow after mating when a cow has mated her family may produce calls of excitement known as the mating pandemonium elephants are known to communicate with seismics vibrations produced by impacts on the earth surface or acoustical waves that travel through it they appear to rely on their leg and shoulder bones to transmit the signals to the middle ear when detecting seismic signals the animals lean forward and put more weight on their larger front feet this is known as the freezing behaviour elephants possess several adaptations suited for seismic communication the cushion pads of the feet contain cartilaginous nodes and have similarities to the acoustic fat found in marine mammals like toothed whales and sirenians a unique muscle around the ear canal constricts the passageway thereby dampening acoustic signals and allowing the animal to hear more seismic signals elephants appear to use seismics for a number of purposes an individual running or mock charging can create seismic signals that can be heard at great distances when detecting the seismics of an alarm call signalling danger from predators elephants enter a defensive posture and family groups will pack together seismic waveforms produced by locomotion appear to travel distances of up to km mi while those from vocalisations travel km mi intelligence and cognition elephants exhibit mirror an indication of and cognition that has also been demonstrated in some apes and dolphins one study of a captive female asian elephant suggested the animal was capable of learning and distinguishing between several visual and some acoustic discrimination pairs this individual was even able to score a high accuracy rating when with the same visual pairs a year later elephants are among the species known to use tools an asian elephant has been observed modifying branches and using them as flyswatters tool modification by these animals is not as advanced as that of chimpanzees elephants are popularly thought of as having an excellent memory this could have a factual basis they possibly have cognitive maps to allow them to remember spaces over long periods of time individuals appear to be able to keep track of the current location of their family membersscientists debate the extent to which elephants feel emotion they appear to show interest in the bones of their own kind regardless of whether they are related as with chimps and dolphins a dying or dead elephant may elicit attention and aid from others including those from other groups this has been interpreted as expressing concern however others would dispute such an interpretation as being anthropomorphic the oxford companion to animal behaviour advised that one is well advised to study the behaviour rather than attempting to get at any underlying emotion conservation status african elephants were listed as vulnerable by the international union for conservation of nature iucn in with no independent assessment of the conservation status of the two forms in africa had an estimated minimum population of million elephants with a possible upper limit of million by the population was estimated to be with in central africa in eastern africa in southern africa and in western africa about elephants were estimated to live in the rainforests fewer than had previously been thought from to elephant populations declined by in east africa after losses in elephant numbers accelerated and savannah populations from cameroon to somalia experienced a decline of african forest elephants had a total loss of population trends in southern africa were mixed with anecdotal reports of losses in zambia mozambique and angola while populations grew in botswana and zimbabwe and were stable in south africa conversely studies in and found populations in eastern and southern africa were increasing by an average annual rate of due to the vast areas involved assessing the total african elephant population remains difficult and involves an element of guesswork the iucn estimates a total of around individuals for while traffic estimates as many as are poached dailyafrican elephants receive at least some legal protection in every country where they are found but of their range exists outside protected areas successful conservation efforts in certain areas have led to high population densities as of local numbers were controlled by contraception or translocation cullings ceased in when zimbabwe abandoned the practice in the african elephant was listed under appendix i by the convention on international trade in endangered species of wild fauna and flora cites making trade illegal appendix ii status which allows restricted trade was given to elephants in botswana namibia and zimbabwe in and south africa in in some countries sport hunting of the animals is legal botswana cameroon gabon mozambique namibia south africa tanzania zambia and zimbabwe have cites export quotas for elephant trophies in june the first lady of kenya margaret kenyatta helped launch the east africa elephant education campaign walk organised by elephant conservationist jim nyamu the event was conducted to raise awareness of the value of elephants and rhinos to help mitigate conflicts and to promote activitiesin the iucn listed the asian elephant as endangered due to a population decline over the past years while cites lists the species under appendix i asian elephants once ranged from syria and iraq the subspecies elephas maximus asurus to china up to the yellow river and java it is now extinct in these areas and the current range of asian elephants is highly fragmented the total population of asian elephants is estimated to be around although this may be a loose estimate it is likely that around half of the population is in india although asian elephants are declining in numbers overall particularly in southeast asia the population in the western ghats appears to be increasing threats the poaching of elephants for their ivory meat and hides has been one of the major threats to their existence historically numerous cultures made ornaments and other works of art from elephant ivory and its use rivalled that of gold the ivory trade contributed to the african elephant population decline in the late century this prompted international bans on ivory imports starting with the united states in june and followed by bans in other north american countries western european countries and japan around the same time kenya destroyed all its ivory stocks cites approved an international ban on ivory that went into effect in january following the bans unemployment rose in india and china where the ivory industry was important economically by contrast japan and hong kong which were also part of the industry were able to adapt and were not badly affected zimbabwe botswana namibia zambia and malawi wanted to continue the ivory trade and were allowed to since their local elephant populations were healthy but only if their supplies were from elephants that had been culled or died of natural causesthe ban allowed the elephant to recover in parts of africa in january elephants in bouba njida national park cameroon were killed by chadian raiders this has been called one of the worst concentrated killings since the ivory ban asian elephants are potentially less vulnerable to the ivory trade as females usually lack tusks still members of the species have been killed for their ivory in some areas such as periyar national park in india china was the biggest market for poached ivory but announced they would phase out the legal domestic manufacture and sale of ivory products in may and in september china and the united states said they would enact a nearly complete ban on the import and export of ivory due to causes of extinctionother threats to elephants include habitat destruction and fragmentation the asian elephant lives in areas with some of the highest human populations because they need larger amounts of land than other sympatric terrestrial mammals they are the first to be affected by human encroachment in extreme cases elephants may be confined to small islands of forest among landscapes elephants can not coexist with humans in agricultural areas due to their size and food requirements elephants commonly trample and consume crops which contributes to conflicts with humans and both elephants and humans have died by the hundreds as a result mitigating these conflicts is important for conservation one proposed solution is the provision of corridors which allow the animals access to key areas association with humans working animal elephants have been working animals since at least the indus valley civilization and continue to be used in modern times there were working elephants employed in asia in these animals are typically captured from the wild when they are years old when they can be trained quickly and easily and will have a longer working life they were traditionally captured with traps and lassos but since tranquillisers have been usedindividuals of the asian species have been often trained as working animals asian elephants perform tasks such as hauling loads into remote areas moving logs to rivers and roads transporting tourists around national parks pulling wagons and leading religious processions in northern thailand the animals are used to digest coffee beans for black ivory coffee they are valued over mechanised tools because they can work in relatively deep water require relatively little maintenance need only vegetation and water as fuel and can be trained to memorise specific tasks elephants can be trained to respond to over commands musth bulls can be difficult and dangerous to work with and are chained and until the condition passes in india many working elephants are alleged to have been subject to abuse they and other captive elephants are thus protected under the prevention of cruelty to animals act of both myanmar and thailand deforestation and other economic factors have resulted in sizable populations of unemployed elephants resulting in health problems for the elephants themselves as well as economic and safety problems for the people amongst whom they livethe practice of working elephants has also been attempted in africa the taming of african elephants in the belgian congo began by decree of leopold ii of belgium during the century and continues to the present with the api elephant domestication centre warfare historically elephants were considered formidable instruments of war they were equipped with armour to protect their sides and their tusks were given sharp points of iron or brass if they were large enough war elephants were trained to grasp an enemy soldier and toss him to the person riding on them or to pin the soldier to the ground and impale himone of the earliest references to war elephants is in the indian epic mahabharata written in the century bc but said to describe events between the and centuries bc they were not used as much as chariots by either the pandavas or kauravas during the magadha kingdom which began in the century bc elephants began to achieve greater cultural importance than horses and later indian kingdoms used war elephants extensively of them were used in the nandas and centuries bc army while may have been used in the mauryan army between the and centuries bc the arthashastra written around bc advised the mauryan government to reserve some forests for wild elephants for use in the army and to execute anyone who killed them from south asia the use of elephants in warfare spread west to persia and east to southeast asia the persians used them during the achaemenid empire between the and centuries bc while southeast asian states first used war elephants possibly as early as the century bc and continued to the centuryin his bc indian campaign alexander the great confronted elephants for the first time and suffered heavy casualties among the reasons for the refusal of the macedonian soldiers to continue the indian conquest were rumors of even larger elephant armies in india alexander trained his foot soldiers to injure the animals and cause them to panic during wars with both the persians and indians ptolemy who was one of alexander generals used corps of asian elephants during his reign as the ruler of egypt which began in bc his son and successor ptolemy ii who began his rule in bc obtained his supply of elephants further south in nubia from then on war elephants were employed in the mediterranean and north africa throughout the classical period the greek king pyrrhus used elephants in his attempted invasion of rome in bc while they frightened the roman horses they were not decisive and pyrrhus ultimately lost the battle the carthaginian general hannibal took elephants across the alps during his war with the romans and reached the po valley in bc with all of them alive but they later succumbed to diseaseoverall elephants owed their initial successes to the element of surprise and to the fear that their great size invoked with time strategists devised and war elephants turned into an expensive liability and were hardly ever used by romans and parthians zoos and circuses elephants were historically kept for display in the menageries of ancient egypt china greece and rome the romans in particular pitted them against humans and other animals in gladiator events in the modern era elephants have traditionally been a major part of zoos and circuses around the world in circuses they are trained to perform tricks the most famous circus elephant was probably jumbo september who was a major attraction in the barnum bailey circus these animals do not reproduce well in captivity due to the difficulty of handling musth bulls and limited understanding of female oestrous cycles asian elephants were always more common than their african counterparts in modern zoos and circuses after cites listed the asian elephant under appendix i in the number of african elephants in zoos increased in the although the import of asians continued subsequently the us received many of its captive african elephants from zimbabwe which had an overabundance of the animals as of around asian and african elephants were kept in zoos and circuses the largest captive population is in north america which has an estimated asian and african elephants about asians and africans are known to exist in europe and japan has around asians and africanskeeping elephants in zoos has met with some controversy proponents of zoos argue that they offer researchers easy access to the animals and provide money and expertise for preserving their natural habitats as well as safekeeping for the species critics claim that the animals in zoos are under physical and mental stress elephants have been recorded displaying stereotypical behaviours in the form of swaying back and forth trunk swaying or route tracing this has been observed in of individuals in uk zoos elephants in european zoos appear to have shorter lifespans than their wild counterparts at only years although other studies suggest that zoo elephants live as long those in the wildthe use of elephants in circuses has also been controversial the humane society of the united states has accused circuses of mistreating and distressing their animals in testimony to a us federal court in barnum bailey circus ceo kenneth feld acknowledged that circus elephants are struck behind their ears under their chins and on their legs with prods called bull hooks or ankus feld stated that these practices are necessary to protect circus workers and acknowledged that an elephant trainer was reprimanded for using an electric shock device known as a hot shot or electric prod on an elephant despite this he denied that any of these practices harm elephants some trainers have tried to train elephants without the use of physical punishment ralph helfer is known to have relied on gentleness and reward when training his animals including elephants and lions ringling bros and barnum and bailey circus retired its touring elephants in may attacks elephants can exhibit bouts of aggressive behaviour and engage in destructive actions against humans in africa groups of adolescent elephants damaged homes in villages after cullings in the and because of the timing these attacks have been interpreted as vindictive in parts of india male elephants regularly enter villages at night destroying homes and killing people elephants killed around people between and in jharkhand while in assam people were reportedly killed between and local people have reported their belief that some elephants were drunk during their attacks although officials have disputed this explanation purportedly drunk elephants attacked an indian village a second time in december killing six people which led to the killing of about elephants by locals cultural depictions in many cultures elephants represent strength power wisdom longevity stamina leadership sociability nurturance and loyalty several cultural references emphasise the elephant size and exotic uniqueness for instance a white elephant is a byword for something expensive useless and bizarre the expression elephant in the room refers to an obvious truth that is ignored or otherwise unaddressed the story of the blind men and an elephant teaches that reality can be observed from different perspectiveselephants have been represented in art since paleolithic times africa in particular contains many rock paintings and engravings of the animals especially in the sahara and southern africa in asia the animals are depicted as motifs in hindu and buddhist shrines and temples elephants were often difficult to portray by people with no experience of them the ancient romans who kept the animals in captivity depicted anatomically accurate elephants on mosaics in tunisia and sicily at the beginning of the middle ages when europeans had little to no access to the animals elephants were portrayed more like fantasy creatures they were often depicted with or bodies with trunks and tusks like a boar some were even given hooves elephants were commonly featured in motifs by the stonemasons of the gothic churches as more elephants began to be sent to european kings as gifts during the century depictions of them became more accurate including one made by leonardo da vinci despite this some europeans continued to portray them in a more stylised fashion max ernst surrealist painting the elephant celebes depicts an elephant as a silo with a hose protruding from itelephants have been the subject of religious beliefs the mbuti people of central africa believe that the souls of their dead ancestors resided in elephants similar ideas existed among other african societies who believed that their chiefs would be reincarnated as elephants during the century ad the people of near the niger delta buried their leaders with elephant tusks the animals religious importance is only totemic in africa but is much more significant in asia in sumatra elephants have been associated with lightning likewise in hinduism they are linked with thunderstorms as airavata the father of all elephants represents both lightning and rainbows one of the most important hindu deities the ganesha is ranked equal with the supreme gods shiva vishnu and brahma ganesha is associated with writers and merchants and it is believed that he can give people success as well as grant them their desires in buddhism buddha is said to have been a white elephant reincarnated as a human in islamic tradition the year when muhammad was born is known as the year of the elephant elephants were thought to be religious themselves by the romans who believed that they worshipped the sun and starselephants are ubiquitous in western popular culture as emblems of the exotic especially since as with the giraffe hippopotamus and rhinoceros there are no similar animals familiar to western audiences the use of the elephant as a symbol of the us republican party began with an cartoon by thomas nast as characters elephants are most common in children stories in which they are generally cast as models of exemplary behaviour they are typically surrogates for humans with ideal human values many stories tell of isolated young elephants returning to a community such as the elephant child from rudyard kipling just so stories disney dumbo and kathryn and byron jackson the saggy
