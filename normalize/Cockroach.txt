cockroaches or roaches are insects of the order blattodea which also includes termites about cockroach species out of are associated with human habitats about five species are well known as pests the cockroaches are an ancient group dating back at least as far as the carboniferous period some million years ago those early ancestors however lacked the internal ovipositors of modern roaches cockroaches are somewhat generalized insects without special adaptations like the sucking mouthparts of aphids and other true bugs they have chewing mouthparts and are likely among the most primitive of living neopteran insects they are common and hardy insects and can tolerate a wide range of environments from arctic cold to tropical heat tropical cockroaches are often much bigger than temperate species and contrary to popular belief extinct cockroach relatives blattoptera and such as the carboniferous archimylacris and the permian apthoroblattina were not as large as the biggest modern species some species such as the gregarious german cockroach have an elaborate social structure involving common shelter social dependence information transfer and kin recognition cockroaches have appeared in human culture since classical antiquity they are popularly depicted as dirty pests though the great majority of species are inoffensive and live in a wide range of habitats around the world taxonomy and evolution cockroaches are members of the order blattodea which includes the termites a group of insects once thought to be separate from cockroaches currently species and over genera are described worldwide the name cockroach comes from the spanish word for cockroach cucaracha transformed by english folk etymology into cock and roach the scientific name derives from the latin blatta an insect that shuns the light which in classical latin was applied not only to cockroaches but also to mantidshistorically the name blattaria was used largely interchangeably with the name blattodea but whilst the former name was used to refer to cockroaches exclusively the latter also includes the termites the current catalogue of world cockroach species uses the name blattodea for the group another name blattoptera is also sometimes used to refer to extinct cockroach relatives the earliest fossils blattopterans or roachids are from the carboniferous period million years ago as are fossil roachoid nymphssince the century scientists believed that cockroaches were an ancient group of insects that had a devonian origin according to one hypothesis fossil roachoids that lived during that time differ from modern cockroaches in that they had long external ovipositors and are the ancestors of mantises as well as modern cockroaches as the body hind wings and mouthparts are not preserved in fossils frequently the relationship of these roachoids and modern cockroaches remains disputed the first fossils of modern cockroaches with internal ovipositors appeared in the early cretaceous a recent phylogenetic analysis suggests that cockroaches originated at least in the jurassicthe evolutionary relationships of the blattodea cockroaches and termites shown in the cladogram are based on eggleton beccaloni and inward the cockroach families lamproblattidae and tryonicidae are not shown but are placed within the superfamily blattoidea the cockroach families corydiidae and ectobiidae were previously known as the polyphagidae and blattellidae termites were previously regarded as a separate order isoptera to cockroaches however recent genetic evidence strongly suggests that they evolved directly from cockroaches and many authors now place them as an epifamily of blattodea this evidence supported a hypothesis suggested in that termites are closely related to the cockroaches genus cryptocercus this hypothesis was originally based on similarity of the symbiotic gut flagellates in termites regarded as living fossils and cockroaches additional evidence emerged when f a mckittrick noted similar morphological characteristics between some termites and cockroach nymphs the similarities among these cockroaches and termites have led some scientists to reclassify termites as a single family the termitidae within the order blattodea other scientists have taken a more conservative approach proposing to retain the termites as the termitoidae an epifamily within the order such a measure preserves the classification of termites at family level and below description most species of cockroach are about the size of a thumbnail but several species are bigger the world heaviest cockroach is the australian giant burrowing cockroach macropanesthia rhinoceros which can reach centimetres in in length and weigh more than grams oz comparable in size is the central american giant cockroach blaberus giganteus the longest cockroach species is megaloblatta longipennis which can reach mm in in length and mm in across a central and south american species megaloblatta blaberoides has the largest wingspan of up to mm in cockroaches are generalized insects with few special adaptations and may be among the most primitive living neopteran insects they have a relatively small head and a broad flattened body and most species are to dark brown they have large compound eyes two ocelli and long flexible antennae the mouthparts are on the underside of the head and include generalized chewing mandibles salivary glands and various touch and taste receptorsthe body is divided into a thorax of three segments and a abdomen the external surface has a tough exoskeleton which contains calcium carbonate and protects the inner organs and provides attachment to muscles it is coated with wax to repel water the wings are attached to the second and third thoracic segments the tegmina or first pair of wings are tough and protective lying as a shield on top of the membranous hind wings which are used in flight all four wings have branching longitudinal veins and multiple three pairs of legs are sturdy with large coxae and five claws each they are attached to each of the three thoracic segments the front legs are the shortest and the hind legs the longest providing the main propulsive power when the insect runs the spines on the legs were earlier considered to be sensory but observations of the insect gait on sand and wire meshes have demonstrated that they help in locomotion on difficult terrain the structures have been used as inspiration for robotic legsthe abdomen has ten segments each with a pair of spiracles for respiration segment ten bears a pair of cerci a pair of anal styles the anus and the external genitalia males have an aedeagus through which they secrete sperm during copulation and females have spermatheca for storing sperm and an ovipositor through which the ootheca are laid distribution and habitat cockroaches are abundant throughout the world and live in a wide range of environments especially in the tropics and subtropics cockroaches can withstand extremely low temperatures allowing them to live in the arctic some species are capable of surviving temperatures of by manufacturing an antifreeze made out of glycerol in north america species separated into five families are found throughout the continent species are found in australia only about four widespread species are commonly regarded as pestscockroaches occupy a wide range of habitats many live in leaf litter among the stems of matted vegetation in rotting wood in holes in stumps in cavities under bark under log piles and among debris some live in arid regions and have developed mechanisms to survive without access to water sources others are aquatic living near the surface of water bodies including bromeliad phytotelmata and diving to forage for food most of these respire by piercing the water surface with the tip of the abdomen which acts as a snorkel but some carry a bubble of air under their thoracic shield when they submerge others live in the forest canopy where they may be one of the main types of invertebrate present here they may hide during the day in crevices among dead leaves in bird and insect nests or among epiphytes emerging at night to feed behavior cockroaches are social insects a large number of species are either gregarious or inclined to aggregate and a slightly smaller number exhibit parental care it used to be thought that cockroaches aggregated because they were reacting to environmental cues but it is now believed that pheromones are involved in these behaviors some species secrete these in their feces with gut microbial symbionts being involved while others use glands located on their mandibles pheromones produced by the cuticle may enable cockroaches to distinguish between different populations of cockroach by odor the behaviors involved have been studied in only a few species but german cockroaches leave fecal trails with an odor gradient other cockroaches follow such trails to discover sources of food and water and where other cockroaches are hiding thus cockroaches have emergent behavior in which group or swarm behavior emerges from a simple set of individual interactionsdaily rhythms may also be regulated by a complex set of hormonal controls of which only a small subset have been understood in the role of one of these proteins pigment dispersing factor pdf was isolated and found to be a key mediator in the circadian rhythms of the cockroachpest species adapt readily to a variety of environments but prefer warm conditions found within buildings many tropical species prefer even warmer environments cockroaches are mainly nocturnal and run away when exposed to light an exception to this is the asian cockroach which flies mostly at night but is attracted to brightly lit surfaces and pale colors collective gregarious cockroaches display collective when choosing food sources when a sufficient number of individuals a quorum exploits a food source this signals to newcomer cockroaches that they should stay there longer rather than leave for elsewhere other mathematical models have been developed to explain aggregation dynamics and conspecific recognitioncooperation and competition are balanced in cockroach group behaviorcockroaches appear to use just two pieces of information to decide where to go namely how dark it is and how many other cockroaches there are a study used robots that seem real to the roaches to demonstrate that once there are enough insects in a place to form a critical mass the roaches accepted the collective decision on where to hide even if this was an unusually lit place social behavior when reared in isolation german cockroaches show behavior that is different from behavior when reared in a group in one study isolated cockroaches were less likely to leave their shelters and explore spent less time eating interacted less with conspecifics when exposed to them and took longer to recognize receptive females because these changes occurred in many contexts the authors suggested them as constituting a behavioral syndrome these effects might have been due either to reduced metabolic and developmental rates in isolated individuals or the fact that the isolated individuals had not had a training period to learn about what others were like via their antennaeindividual american cockroaches appear to have consistently different personalities regarding how they seek shelter in addition group personality is not simply the sum of individual choices but reflects conformity and collective gregarious german and american cockroaches have elaborate social structure chemical signalling and social herd characteristics lihoreau and his fellow researchers stated the social biology of domiciliary cockroaches can be characterized by a common shelter overlapping generations of groups equal reproductive potential of group members an absence of task specialization high levels of social dependence central place foraging social information transfer kin recognition and a structure sounds some species make a hissing noise while other cockroaches make a chirping noise the madagascar hissing cockroach produces its sound through the modified spiracles on the fourth abdominal segment several different hisses are produced including disturbance sounds produced by adults and larger nymphs and aggressive courtship and copulatory sounds produced by adult maleshenschoutedenia epilamproides has a stridulatory organ between its thorax and abdomen but the purpose of the sound produced is unclearseveral australian species practice acoustic and vibration behavior as an aspect of courtship they have been observed producing hisses and whistles from air forced through the spiracles furthermore in the presence of a potential mate some cockroaches tap the substrate in a rhythmic repetitive manner acoustic signals may be of greater prevalence amongst perching species particularly those that live on low vegetation in australia tropics biology digestive tract cockroaches are generally omnivorous the american cockroach periplaneta americana for example feeds on a great variety of foodstuffs including bread fruit leather starch in book bindings paper glue skin flakes hair dead insects and soiled clothing many species of cockroach harbor in their gut symbiotic protozoans and bacteria which are able to digest cellulose in many species these symbionts may be essential if the insect is to utilize cellulose however some species secrete cellulase in their saliva and the cockroach panesthia cribrata is able to survive indefinitely on a diet of crystallized cellulose while being free of microorganismsthe similarity of these symbionts in the genus cryptocercus to those in termites are such that these cockroaches have been suggested to be more closely related to termites than to other cockroaches and current research strongly supports this hypothesis about their relationships all species studied so far carry the obligate mutualistic endosymbiont bacterium blattabacterium with the exception of nocticola australiensise an australian species without eyes pigment or wings which recent genetic studies indicate is a very primitive cockroach it had previously been thought that all five families of cockroach were descended from a common ancestor that was infected with b cuenoti it may be that n australiensise subsequently lost its symbionts or alternatively this hypothesis will need to be tracheae and breathing like other insects cockroaches breathe through a system of tubes called tracheae which are attached to openings called spiracles on all body segments when the carbon dioxide level in the insect rises high enough valves on the spiracles open and carbon dioxide diffuses out and oxygen diffuses in the tracheal system branches repeatedly the finest tracheoles bringing air directly to each cell allowing gaseous exchange to take placewhile cockroaches do not have lungs as do vertebrates and can continue to respire if their heads are removed in some very large species the body musculature may contract rhythmically to forcibly move air in and out of the spiracles this may be considered a form of breathing reproduction cockroaches use pheromones to attract mates and the males practice courtship rituals such as posturing and stridulation like many insects cockroaches mate facing away from each other with their genitalia in contact and copulation can be prolonged a few species are known to be parthenogenetic reproducing without the need for malesfemale cockroaches are sometimes seen carrying egg cases on the end of their abdomens the german cockroach holds about to long thin eggs in a case called an ootheca she drops the capsule prior to hatching though live births do occur in rare instances the egg capsule may take more than five hours to lay and is initially bright white in color the eggs are hatched from the combined pressure of the hatchlings gulping air the hatchlings are initially bright white nymphs and continue inflating themselves with air becoming harder and darker within about four hours their transient white stage while hatching and later while molting has led to claims of albino cockroaches development from eggs to adults takes three to four months cockroaches live up to a year and the female may produce up to eight egg cases in a lifetime in favorable conditions she can produce to offspring other species of cockroaches however can produce far more eggs in some cases a female needs to be impregnated only once to be able to lay eggs for the rest of her lifethe female usually attaches the egg case to a substrate inserts it into a suitably protective crevice or carries it about until just before the eggs hatch some species however are ovoviviparous keeping the eggs inside their body with or without an egg case until they hatch at least one genus diploptera is fully viviparouscockroaches have incomplete metamorphosis meaning that the nymphs are generally similar to the adults except for undeveloped wings and genitalia development is generally slow and may take a few months to over a year the adults are also and have survived for as much as four years in the laboratory hardiness cockroaches are among the hardiest insects some species are capable of remaining active for a month without food and are able to survive on limited resources such as the glue from the back of postage stamps some can go without air for minutes japanese cockroach periplaneta japonica nymphs which hibernate in cold winters have survived twelve hours at to to in laboratory experimentsexperiments on decapitated specimens of several species of cockroach found a variety of behavioral functionality remained including shock avoidance and escape behavior although many insects other than cockroaches are also able to survive decapitation and popular claims of the longevity of headless cockroaches do not appear to be based on published research the severed head is able to survive and wave its antennae for several hours or longer when refrigerated and given nutrientsit is popularly suggested that cockroaches will inherit the earth if humanity destroys itself in a nuclear war cockroaches do indeed have a much higher radiation resistance than vertebrates with the lethal dose perhaps six to times that for humans however they are not exceptionally compared to other insects such as the fruit flythe cockroach ability to withstand radiation better than human beings can be explained through the cell cycle cells are most vulnerable to the effects of radiation when they are dividing a cockroach cells divide only once each time it molts which is weekly at most in a juvenile roach since not all cockroaches would be molting at the same time many would be unaffected by an acute burst of radiation although lingering radioactive fallout would still be harmful relationship with humans in research and education because of their ease of rearing and resilience cockroaches have been used as insect models in the laboratory particularly in the fields of neurobiology reproductive physiology and social behavior the cockroach is a convenient insect to study as it is large and simple to raise in a laboratory environment this makes it suitable both for research and for school and undergraduate biology studies it can be used in experiments on topics such as learning sexual pheromones spatial orientation aggression activity rhythms and the biological clock and behavioral ecology research conducted in suggests that humans fear cockroaches the most even more than mosquitoes due to an evolutionary aversion as pests the blattodea include some thirty species of cockroaches associated with humans these species are atypical of the thousands of species in the order they feed on human and pet food and can leave an offensive odor they can passively transport pathogenic microbes on their body surfaces particularly in environments such as hospitals cockroaches are linked with allergic reactions in humans one of the proteins that trigger allergic reactions is tropomyosin these allergens are also linked with asthma about of asthma patients in chicago are also sensitive to cockroach allergens studies similar to this have been done globally and all the results are similar some species of cockroach can live for up to a month without food so just because no cockroaches are visible in a home does not mean that they are not there approximately of homes with no visible sign of cockroaches have detectable cockroach allergens in dustcockroaches can burrow into human ears causing pain and hearing loss they may be removed with forceps possibly after first drowning with olive oil control many remedies have been tried in the search for control of the major pest species of cockroaches which are resilient and household chemicals like sodium bicarbonate baking soda have been suggested without evidence for their effectiveness garden herbs including bay catnip mint cucumber and garlic have been proposed as repellents poisoned bait containing hydramethylnon or fipronil and boric acid powder is effective on adults baits with egg killers are also quite effective at reducing the cockroach population alternatively insecticides containing deltamethrin or pyrethrin are very effective in singapore and malaysia taxi drivers use pandan leaves to repel cockroaches in their vehiclessome parasites and predators are effective for biological control of cockroaches parasitoidal wasps such as ampulex wasps sting nerve ganglia in the cockroach thorax causing temporary paralysis and allowing the wasp to deliver an incapacitating sting into the cockroach brain the wasp clips the antennae with its mandibles and drinks some hemolymph before dragging the prey to a burrow where an egg rarely two is laid on it the wasp larva feeds on the subdued living cockroach another wasp considered to be a promising candidate for biological control is the ensign wasp evania appendigaster which attacks cockroach oothecae to lay a single egg inside ongoing research is still developing technologies allowing for these wasps for application releases widow spiders commonly prey on cockroaches though their venomous bite introduces its own problems for humans and pets cockroaches can be trapped in a deep jar baited with food inside placed so that cockroaches can reach the opening for example with a ramp of card or twigs on the outside an inch or so of water or stale beer by itself a cockroach attractant in the jar can be used to drown any insects thus captured the method works well with the american cockroach but less so with the german cockroacha study conducted by scientists at purdue university concluded that the most common cockroaches in the us australia and europe were able to develop a cross resistance to multiple types of pesticide this contradicted previous understanding that the animals can develop resistance against one pesticide at a time the scientists suggested that cockroaches will no longer be easily controlled using a diverse spectrum of chemical pesticides and that a mix of other means such as traps and better sanitation will need to be employed as food although considered disgusting in western culture cockroaches are eaten in many places around the world whereas household pest cockroaches may carry bacteria and viruses cockroaches bred under laboratory conditions can be used to prepare nutritious food in mexico and thailand the heads and legs are removed and the remainder may be boiled sauteed grilled dried or diced in china cockroaches have become popular as medicine and cockroach farming is rising with over farmsthe cockroaches are fried twice in a wok of hot oil which makes them crispy with soft innards that are like cottage cheese fried cockroaches are ground and sold as pills for stomach heart and liver diseases a cockroach recipe from formosa taiwan specifies salting and frying cockroaches after removing the head and entrails in traditional and homeopathic medicine in china cockroaches are raised in large quantities for medicinal purposestwo species of cockroach were used in homeopathic medicine in the century conservation while a small minority of cockroaches are associated with human habitats and viewed as repugnant by many people a few species are of conservation concern the lord howe island cockroach panesthia lata is listed as endangered by the new south wales scientific committee but the cockroach may be extinct on lord howe island itself the introduction of rats the spread of rhodes grass chloris gayana and fires are possible reasons for their scarcity two species are currently listed as endangered and critically endangered by the iucn red list delosia ornata and nocticola gerlachi both cockroaches have a restricted distribution and are threatened by habitat loss and rising sea levels only delosia ornata adults and nymphs are known to exist and these are threatened by a hotel development no action has been taken to save the two cockroach species but protecting their natural habitats may prevent their extinction in the former soviet union cockroach populations have been declining at an alarming rate this may be exaggerated or the phenomenon may be temporary or cyclic one species of roach simandoa conserfariam is considered extinct in the wild cultural depictions cockroaches were known and considered repellent but medicinally useful in classical times an insect named in greek silphe silphe has been identified with the cockroach though the scientific name silpha refers to a genus of carrion beetles it is mentioned by aristotle saying that it sheds its skin it is described as in aristophanes play peace euenus called it a pest of book collections being destructive in his analect virgil named the cockroach lucifuga one that avoids light pliny the elder recorded the use of blatta in various medicines he describes the insect as disgusting and as seeking out dark corners to avoid the light dioscorides recorded the use of the silphe ground up with oil as a remedy for earachelafcadio hearn asserted that for tetanus cockroach tea is given i do not know how many cockroaches go to make up the cup but i find that faith in this remedy is strong among many of the american population of new orleans a poultice of boiled cockroaches is placed over the wound he adds that cockroaches are eaten fried with garlic for indigestionseveral cockroach species such as blaptica dubia are raised as food for insectivorous pets a few cockroach species are raised as pets most commonly the giant madagascar hissing cockroach gromphadorhina portentosa whilst the hissing cockroaches may be the most commonly kept species there are many species that are kept by cockroach enthusiasts there is even a specialist society the blattodea culture group bcg which was a thriving organisation for about years although now appears to be dormant the bcg provided a source of literature for people interested in rearing cockroaches which was otherwise limited to either scientific papers or general insect books or books covering a variety of exotic pets in the absence of an inclusive book one member published introduction to rearing cockroaches which still appears to be the only book dedicated to rearing cockroachescockroaches have been used for space tests a cockroach given the name nadezhda was sent into space by russian scientists as part of a mission during which she mated and later became the first terrestrial animal to produce offspring that had been conceived in spacebecause of their long association with humans cockroaches are frequently referred to in popular culture in western culture cockroaches are often depicted as dirty pests in a journal peter osbeck noted that cockroaches
