columbidae is a bird family consisting of pigeons and doves it is the only family in the order columbiformes these are birds with short necks and short slender bills that in some species feature fleshy ceres they primarily feed on seeds fruits and plants the family occurs worldwide but the greatest variety is in the indomalayan and australasian realms the family contains species divided into genera thirteen of the species are extinctin english the smaller species tend to be called doves and the larger ones pigeons the distinction is not consistent however and does not exist in most other languages for example the woodpigeon is often referred to by another name as the ringdove due to the white markings on its neck historically the common names for these birds involve a great deal of variation between the terms the bird most commonly referred to as just pigeon is the domestic pigeon which is common in many cities as the feral pigeon pigeon is a french word that derives from the latin pipio for a peeping chick while dove is a germanic word that refers to the bird diving flight the english dialectal word culver appears to derive from latin columba a group of doves is called a dule pronounced taken from the french word deuil mourning doves and pigeons build relatively flimsy nests often using sticks and other debris which may be placed on branches of trees on ledges or on the ground depending on species they lay one or usually two white eggs at a time and both parents care for the young which leave the nest after days unfledged baby doves and pigeons are called squabs and are generally able to fly by weeks of age these fledglings with their immature squeaking voices are called squeakers once they are weaned or weaning unlike most birds both sexes of doves and pigeons produce crop milk to feed to their young secreted by a sloughing of cells from the lining of the crop taxonomy and systematics the name columbidae for the family was introduced by the english zoologist william elford leach in a guide to the contents of the british museum published in columbidae is the only living family in the order columbiformes the sandgrouses pteroclidae were formerly placed here but were moved to a separate order pterocliformes based on anatomical differences eg they are unable to drink by sucking or pumping they are now considered to be more closely related to shorebirds recent phylogenomic studies support the grouping of pigeons and sandgrouse together along with mesites forming the sister taxon to mirandornithesthe columbidae are usually divided into five subfamilies probably inaccurately for example the american ground and quail doves geotrygon which are usually placed in the columbinae seem to be two distinct subfamilies the order presented here follows baptista et al with some updatesthe arrangement of genera and naming of subfamilies is in some cases provisional because analyses of different dna sequences yield results that differ often radically in the placement of certain mainly genera this ambiguity probably caused by long branch attraction seems to confirm the first pigeons evolved in the australasian region and that the treronidae and allied forms crowned and pheasant pigeons for example represent the earliest radiation of the groupthe family columbidae previously also contained the family raphidae consisting of the extinct rodrigues solitaire and the dodo these species are in all likelihood part of the radiation that produced the three small subfamilies mentioned above with the fruit doves and pigeons including the nicobar pigeon therefore they are here included as a subfamily raphinae pending better material evidence of their exact relationshipsexacerbating these issues columbids are not well represented in the fossil record no truly primitive forms have been found to date the genus gerandia has been described from early miocene deposits in france but while it was long believed to be a pigeon it is now considered a sandgrouse fragmentary remains of a probably ptilinopine early miocene pigeon were found in the bannockburn formation of new zealand and described as rupephaps columbina prattae from roughly contemporary deposits of florida is nowadays tentatively separated in arenicolumba but its distinction from and related genera needs to be more firmly established eg by cladistic analysis apart from that all other fossils belong to extant genera taxonomy taxonomy based on the work by john h boyd iii a professor of economics description size and appearance pigeons and doves exhibit considerable variation in size ranging in length from to centimetres to in and in weight from g lb to above g lb the largest species is the crowned pigeon of new guinea which is nearly at a weight of kg lb the smallest is the new world ground dove of the genus columbina which is the same size as a house sparrow weighing as little as g lb the dwarf fruit dove which may measure as little as cm in has a marginally smaller total length than any other species from this family one of the largest arboreal species the marquesan imperial pigeon currently battles extinction anatomy and physiology overall the anatomy of columbidae is characterized by short legs short bills with a fleshy cere and small heads on large compact bodies like some other birds the columbidae have no gall bladders some medieval naturalists concluded they have no bile gall which in the medieval theory of the four humours explained the allegedly sweet disposition of doves in fact however they do have bile as aristotle had earlier realized which is secreted directly into the gut the wings are large and have eleven primary feathers pigeons have strong wing muscles wing muscles comprise of their body weight and are among the strongest fliers of all birdsin a series of experiments in by dr mark b friedman using doves their characteristic head bobbing was shown to be due to their natural desire to keep their vision constant it was shown yet again in a experiment by dr barrie j frost in which pigeons were placed on treadmills it was observed that they did not bob their heads as their surroundings were constant feathers columbidae have unique body feathers with the shaft being generally broad strong and flattened tapering to a fine point abruptly in general the aftershaft is absent however small ones on some tail and wing feathers may be present body feathers have very dense fluffy bases are attached loosely into the skin and drop out easily possibly serving as a predator avoidance mechanism large numbers of feathers fall out in the attacker mouth if the bird is snatched facilitating the bird escape the plumage of the family is variable granivorous species tend to have dull plumage with a few exceptions whereas the frugivorous species have brightly coloured plumage the ptilinopus fruit doves are some of the brightest coloured pigeons with the three endemic species of fiji and the indian ocean alectroenas being the brightest pigeons and doves may be sexually monochromatic or dichromatic in addition to bright colours pigeons may sport crests or other ornamentation flight columbidae are excellent fliers due to the lift provided by their large wings which results in low wing loading they are highly maneuverable in flight and have a low aspect ratio due to the width of their wings allowing for quick flight launches and ability to escape from predators but at a high energy cost distribution and habitat pigeons and doves are distributed everywhere on earth except for the driest areas of the sahara desert antarctica and its surrounding islands and the high arctic they have colonised most of the world oceanic islands reaching eastern polynesia and the chatham islands in the pacific mauritius the seychelles and reunion in the indian ocean and the azores in the atlantic ocean the family has adapted to most of the habitats available on the planet these species may be arboreal terrestrial or various species also inhabit savanna grassland desert temperate woodland and forest mangrove forest and even the barren sands and gravels of atollssome species have large natural ranges the eared dove ranges across the entirety of south america from colombia to tierra del fuego the eurasian collared dove has a massive if discontinuous distribution from britain across europe the middle east india pakistan and china and the laughing dove across most of africa as well as india pakistan and the middle east other species have tiny restricted distributions this is most common in island endemics the whistling dove is endemic to the tiny kadavu island in fiji the caroline ground dove is restricted to two islands truk and pohnpei in the caroline islands and the grenada dove is restricted to grenada in the caribbean some continental species also have tiny distributions for example the fruit dove is restricted to a small area of the arnhem land of australia the somali pigeon is restricted to a tiny area of northern somalia and moreno ground dove is restricted to the area around salta and tucuman in northern argentinathe largest range of any species is that of the rock dove this species had a large natural distribution from britain and ireland to northern africa across europe arabia central asia india the himalayas and up into china and mongolia the range of the species increased dramatically upon domestication as the species went feral in cities around the world the species is currently resident across most of north america and has established itself in cities and urban areas in south america africa southeast asia japan australia and new zealand the species is not the only pigeon to have increased its range due to the actions of man several other species have become established outside of their natural range after escaping captivity and other species have increased their natural ranges due to habitat changes caused by human activity a study found that the east coast of the us includes two pigeon genetic megacities in new york and boston and they do mix behaviour male pigeons are more opportunistic to mate with another female feeding seeds and fruit form the major component of the diets of pigeons and doves in fact the family can be divided into the or granivorous species subfamily columbinae and the or frugivorous species the other four subfamilies the granivorous species typically feed on seed found on the ground whereas the frugivorous species tend to feed in trees there are morphological adaptations that can be used to distinguish between the two groups granivores tend to have thick walls in their gizzards intestines and esophagi whereas the frugivores tend to have thin walls in addition species have short intestines whereas those that eat seeds have longer ones frugivores are capable of clinging to branches and even hang upside down to reach fruitin addition to fruit and seeds a number of other food items are taken by many species some particularly the ground doves and eat a large number of prey items such as insects and worms one species the atoll fruit dove is specialised in taking insect and reptile prey snails moths and other insects are taken by pigeons orange fruit doves and ruddy ground doves status and conservation while many species of pigeons and doves have benefited from human activities and have increased their ranges many other species have declined in numbers and some have become threatened or even succumbed to extinction among the ten species to have become extinct since the conventional date for estimating modern extinctions are two of the most famous extinct species the dodo and the passenger pigeonthe passenger pigeon was exceptional for a number of reasons in modern times it is the only pigeon species that was not an island species to have become extinct even though it was once the most numerous species of bird on earth its former numbers are difficult to estimate but one ornithologist alexander wilson estimated one flock he observed contained over two billion birds the decline of the species was abrupt in a breeding colony was estimated to contain over a hundred million birds yet the last individual in the species was dead by although habitat loss was a contributing factor the species is thought to have been massively being used as food for slaves and later the poor in the united states throughout the centurythe dodo and its extinction was more typical of the extinctions of pigeons in the past like many species that colonise remote islands with few predators it lost much of its predator avoidance behaviour along with its ability to fly the arrival of people along with a suite of other introduced species such as rats pigs and cats quickly spelled the end for this species and all the other island forms that have become extinctaround species of pigeons and doves are threatened with extinction today about of all species most of these are tropical and live on islands all of the species are threatened by introduced predators habitat loss hunting or a combination of these factors in some cases they may be extinct in the wild as is the socorro dove of socorro island mexico last seen in the wild in driven to extinction by habitat loss and introduced feral cats in some areas a lack of knowledge means the true status of a species is unknown the negros fruit dove has not been seen since and may or may not be extinct and the polynesian ground dove is classified as critically endangered as whether it survives or not on remote islands in the far west of the pacific ocean is unknownvarious conservation techniques are employed to prevent these extinctions including laws and regulations to control hunting pressure the establishment of protected areas to prevent further habitat loss the establishment of captive populations for reintroduction back into the wild ex situ conservation and the translocation of individuals to suitable habitats to create additional populations military the pigeon was used in both world war i and ii notably by the australian french german american and uk forces they were also awarded with various laurels throughout for their service on december three pigeons winkie tyke and white vision were awarded the first dickin medal serving with britain royal air force for rescuing an air force crew during world war ii pigeons have been decorated with the dickin medal citing them for brave service for war contributions including commando gi joe paddy royal blue and william of orangecher ami a homing pigeon in world war i was awarded the croix de guerre medal by france with a palm oak leaf cluster for her service in verdun despite having almost lost a leg and being shot in the chest she managed to travel around miles to deliver the message that saved men of the lost battalion of the infantry division in the battle of the argonne in october when cher ami died she was mounted and is part of the permanent exhibit at the national museum of american history of the smithsonian institutiona grand ceremony was held in buckingham palace to commemorate a platoon of pigeons that braved the battlefields of normandy to deliver vital plans to allied forces on the fringes of germany three of the actual birds that received the medals are on show in the london military museum so that can pay their respects domestication the rock pigeon has been domesticated for hundreds of years it has been bred into several varieties kept by hobbyists of which the best known is the homing pigeon or racing homer other popular breeds are tumbling pigeons such as the birmingham roller and fancy varieties that are bred for certain physical characteristics such as large feathers on the feet or tails domesticated rock pigeons are also bred as carrier pigeons used for thousands of years to carry brief written messages and release doves used in ceremonies white doves are also commonly used in magic acts in religion in ancient mesopotamia doves were prominent animal symbols of the goddess of love sexuality and war doves are shown on cultic objects associated with inanna as early as the beginning of the third millennium bc lead dove figurines were discovered in the temple of ishtar at assur dating to the thirteenth century bc and a painted fresco from mari syria shows a giant dove emerging from a palm tree in the temple of ishtar indicating that the goddess herself was sometimes believed to take the form of a dove in the epic of gilgamesh utnapishtim releases a dove and a raven to find land the dove merely circles and returns only then does utnapishtim send forth the raven which does not return and utnapishtim concludes the raven has found landin the ancient levant doves were used as symbols for the canaanite mother goddess asherah the ancient greek word for dove was peristera which may be derived from the semitic phrase perah istar meaning bird of ishtar in classical antiquity doves were sacred to the greek goddess aphrodite who absorbed this association with doves from aphrodite frequently appears with doves in ancient greek pottery the temple of aphrodite pandemos on the southwest slope of the athenian acropolis was decorated with relief sculptures of doves with knotted fillets in their beaks and votive offerings of small white marble doves were discovered in the temple of aphrodite at daphni during aphrodite main festival the aphrodisia her altars would be purified with the blood of a sacrificed dove aphrodite associations with doves influenced the roman goddesses venus and fortuna causing them to become associated with doves as well in the hebrew bible doves or young pigeons are acceptable burnt offerings for those who can not afford a more expensive animal in genesis noah sends a dove out of the ark but it came back to him because the floodwaters had not receded seven days later he sent it again and it came back with an olive branch in her mouth indicating the waters had receded enough for an olive tree to grow dove is also a term of endearment in the song of songs and elsewhere in hebrew jonah means dove the sign of jonas in is related to the sign of the dove jesus parents sacrificed doves on his behalf after his circumcision luke later the holy spirit descended upon jesus at his baptism like a dove matthew and subsequently the peace dove became a common christian symbol of the holy spiritin islam doves and the pigeon family in general are respected and favoured because they are believed to have assisted the final prophet of islam muhammad in distracting his enemies outside the cave of thaw r in the great hijra a pair of pigeons had built a nest and laid eggs at once and a spider had woven cobwebs which in the darkness of the night made the fugitives believe that muhammad could not be in that cave as food several species of pigeons and doves are used as food however all types are edible domesticated or hunted pigeons have been used as the source of food since the times of the ancient middle east ancient rome and medieval europe it is familiar meat within jewish arab and french cuisines according to the tanakh doves are kosher and they are the only birds that may be used for a korban other kosher birds may be eaten but not brought as a korban pigeon is also used in asian cuisines such as chinese assamese and indonesian cuisines in europe the wood pigeon is commonly shot as a game bird while rock pigeons were originally domesticated as a food species and many breeds were developed for their qualities the extinction of the passenger pigeon in north america was at least partly due to shooting for use as food mrs beeton book of household management
