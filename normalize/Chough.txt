there are two species of passerine birds commonly called chough chuf that constitute the genus pyrrhocorax of the corvidae crow family of birds these are the chough pyrrhocorax pyrrhocorax and the alpine chough or chough pyrrhocorax graculus the chough of australia despite its name is not a true chough but rather a member of the family corcoracidae and only distantly related the choughs have black plumage and brightly coloured legs feet and bills and are resident in the mountains of southern eurasia and north africa they have long broad wings and perform spectacular aerobatics both species pair for life and display fidelity to their breeding sites which are usually caves or crevices in a cliff face they build a lined stick nest and lay three to five eggs they feed usually in flocks on short grazed grassland taking mainly invertebrate prey supplemented by vegetable material or food from human habitation especially in winter changes in agricultural practices which have led to local population declines and range fragmentation are the main threats to this genus although neither species is threatened globally taxonomy the first member of the genus to be described was the chough named as upupa pyrrhocorax by linnaeus in his systema naturae in his genus upupa contained species that had a long curved bill and a short blunt tongue these included the northern bald ibis and the hoopoe birds now known to be completely unrelated to the choughsthe alpine chough was described as corvus graculus by linnaeus in the edition of the systema naturae although corvus is the crow genus to which the choughs relatives belong they were considered sufficiently distinctive to be moved to the new genus pyrrhocorax by english ornithologist marmaduke tunstall in his ornithologia britannica the genus name is derived from ancient greek purrhos purros and korax korax raven crow chough was originally an alternative onomatopoeic name for the jackdaw corvus monedula based on its call the similar chough formerly particularly common in cornwall became known initially as cornish chough and then just chough the name transferring from one species to the otherthe fossil record from the pleistocene of europe includes a form similar to the alpine chough and sometimes categorised as an extinct subspecies of that bird and a prehistoric form of the chough p p primigenius there are eight generally recognised extant subspecies of chough and two of alpine although all differ only slightly from the nominate forms the greater subspecies diversity in the species arises from an early divergence of the asian and geographically isolated ethiopian races from the western formsthe closest relative of the choughs as indicated by a study of molecular phylogeny is the treepie temnurus temnurus and they form a clade that is sister to the remaining living members of the corvidae the genus pyrrhocorax species differ from corvus in that they have brightly coloured bills and feet smooth not scaled tarsi and very short dense nasal feathers choughs have uniformly black plumage lacking any paler areas as seen in some of their relatives the two pyrrhocorax are the main hosts of two specialist chough fleas frontopsylla frontalis and f laetus not normally found on other corvidsthe australian chough corcorax melanorhamphos despite its similar shape and habits is only distantly related to the true choughs and is an example of convergent evolution distribution and habitat choughs breed in mountains from morocco and spain eastwards through southern europe and the alps across central asia and the himalayas to western china the alpine chough is also found in corsica and crete and the chough has populations in ireland the uk the isle of man and two areas of the ethiopian highlands both species are residents throughout their range only occasionally wandering to neighbouring countriesthese birds are mountain specialists although choughs also use coastal sea cliffs in ireland great britain and brittany feeding on adjacent short grazed grassland or machair the small population on la palma one of the canary islands is also coastal the chough more typically breeds in mountains above m ft in europe m ft in north africa and m ft in the himalayas in that mountain range it reaches metres ft in the summer and has been recorded at metres ft altitude on mount everest the alpine chough breeds above m ft in europe m ft in morocco and m ft in the himalayas it has nested at m ft higher than any other bird species and it has been observed following mountaineers ascending mount everest at an altitude of m ft where the two species occur in the same mountains the alpine species tends to breed at a higher elevation than its relative since it is better adapted for a diet at high altitudes description the choughs are corvids the chough is centimetres in in length with a centimetres in wingspan and the alpine chough averages slightly smaller at in length with a cm in wingspan these birds have black plumage similar to that of many corvus crows but they are readily distinguished from members of that genus by their brightly coloured bills and legs the alpine chough has a yellow bill and the chough has a long curved red bill both species have red legs as adults the sexes are similar but the juvenile of each species has a duller bill and legs than the adult and its plumage lacks the glossiness seen in older birds other physical distinctions are summarised in the table below the two choughs are distinguishable from each other by their bill colour and in flight the long broad wings and short tail of the give it a silhouette quite different from its slightly smaller relative both species fly with loose deep wing beats and frequently use their manoeuvrability to perform acrobatic displays soaring in the updraughts at cliff faces then diving and rolling with fanned tail and folded wingsthe chough loud ringing call is similar in character to that of other corvids particularly the jackdaw although it is clearer and louder than the call of that species in contrast the alpine chough has rippling preep and whistled sweeeooo calls quite unlike the crows small subspecies of both choughs have higher frequency calls than larger races as predicted by the inverse relationship between body size and frequency behaviour and ecology breeding choughs are monogamous and show high partner and site fidelity both species build a bulky nest of roots sticks and plant stems lined with grass fine twiglets or hair it is constructed on a ledge in a cave or similar fissure in a cliff face or in locations like abandoned buildings quarries or dams will also sometimes use occupied buildings such as mongolian monasteries the choughs are not colonial although in suitable habitat several pairs may nest in close proximityboth species lay normally whitish eggs blotched with brown or grey which are incubated by the female alone the chicks hatch after two to three weeks chough chicks are almost naked but the chicks of the higher altitude alpine chough hatch with a dense covering of natal down the chicks are fed by both parents and fledge in days after hatching for alpine chough and days for alpine chough lays its eggs about one month later than its relative although breeding success and reproductive behaviour are similar the similarities between the two species presumably arose because of the same strong environmental constraints on breeding behaviour the survival rate of the juvenile chough is percent and for the alpine it is the annual adult survival rate is for alpine but is unknown for feeding in the summer both choughs feed mainly on invertebrates such as beetles snails grasshoppers caterpillars and fly larvae ants are a favoured food of the chough prey items are taken from short grazed pasture or in the case of coastal populations of chough areas where plant growth is hindered by exposure to coastal salt spray or poor soils the chough bill may be used to pick insects off the surface or to dig for grubs and other invertebrates the chough typically excavates to cm in in the thin soils of its feeding areas but it may dig to cm in in suitable conditionsplant matter is also eaten and chough will take fallen grain where the opportunity arises it has been reported as damaging barley crops by breaking off the ripening heads to extract the corn alpine choughs rely more on fruit and berries at times of year when animal prey is limited and will readily supplement their winter diet with food provided by tourist activities in mountain regions including ski resorts refuse dumps and picnic areas both pyrrhocorax species feed in flocks on open areas often some distance from the breeding cliffs particularly in winter feeding trips may cover km mi distance and m ft in altitude in the alps the development of skiing above m ft has enabled more alpine choughs to remain at high levels in winterwhere their ranges overlap the two chough species may feed together in the summer although there is only limited competition for food an italian study showed that the vegetable part of the winter diet for the chough was almost exclusively gagea bulbs whilst the alpine chough took berries and hips in june choughs fed mainly on caterpillars whereas alpine choughs ate cranefly pupae later in the summer the alpine chough consumed large numbers of grasshoppers while the chough added cranefly pupae fly larvae and beetles to its diet in the eastern himalayas in november alpine choughs occur mainly in juniper forests where they feed on juniper berries differing ecologically from the choughs in the same region and at the same time of year which dig for food in the soil of the villages terraced pastures natural threats predators of the choughs include the peregrine falcon golden eagle and eurasian while the common raven will take nestlings in northern spain choughs preferentially nest near lesser kestrel colonies the falcon which eats only insects provides a degree of protection against larger predators and the chough benefits in terms of a higher breeding success the chough is occasionally parasitised by the great spotted cuckoo a brood parasite for which the eurasian magpie is the primary hostthe choughs host bird fleas including two frontopsylla species which are pyrrhocorax specialist other parasites recorded on choughs include a cestode choanotaenia pirinica and various species of chewing lice in the genera brueelia menacanthus and philopterus blood parasites such as plasmodium have been found in choughs but this is uncommon and apparently does little harm parasitism levels are much lower than in some other passerine groups status both pyrrhocorax species have extensive geographical ranges and large populations neither is thought to approach the thresholds for the global population decline criteria of the iucn red list ie declining more than in ten years or three generations and they are therefore evaluated as being of least concern however some populations particularly on islands such as corsica and la palma are small and isolatedboth choughs occupied more extensive ranges in the past reaching to more southerly and lower altitude areas than at present with the alpine chough breeding in europe as far south as southern italy and both the decline and range fragmentation continue choughs have lost ground in most of europe and alpine choughs have lost many breeding sites in the east of the continent in the canary islands the chough is now extinct on two of the islands on which it formerly bred and the alpine was lost from the archipelago altogetherthe causes of the decline include the fragmentation and loss of open grasslands to scrub or human activities such as the construction of ski resorts and a threat comes from global warming which would cause the species preferred alpine climate zone to shift to higher more restricted areas or locally to disappear entirelythe chough which breeds at lower levels has been more affected by human activity and the declines away from its main alpine breeding areas have seen it categorised as vulnerable in europe only in spain is it still common and it has recently expanded its range in that country by nesting in old buildings in areas close to its traditional mountain breeding sites in culture further information chough although these are mainly mountain species with limited interactions with humans the chough has a coastal population in the far west of its range and has cultural connections particularly with cornwall where it appears on the cornish coat of arms a legend from that county says that king arthur did not die but was transformed into a chough and hence killing this bird was unluckythe chough was formerly reputed to be a habitual thief of small objects from houses including burning wood or lighted candles which it would use to set fire to haystacks or thatched roofsas a high altitude species with limited contact with humans until the development of mountain tourism activities the alpine chough has little cultural significance it was however featured together with its wild mountain habitat in olivier messiaen s catalogue bird catalogue a piano piece written in le chocard des alpes the alpine chough is the opening piece of book of the worka group
