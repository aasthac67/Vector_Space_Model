the elk cervus canadensis or wapiti is one of the largest species within the deer family cervidae and one of the largest terrestrial mammals in north america and northeast asia this animal should not be confused with the still larger moose alces alces of north america alternatively known as elk in british english and related names in other european languages german elch danish elg french elan in reference to populations in eurasia elk range in forest and habitat feeding on grasses plants leaves and bark male elk have large antlers which are shed each year males also engage in ritualized mating behaviors during the rut including posturing antler wrestling sparring and bugling a loud series of vocalizations that establishes dominance over other males and attracts females although it is currently native to north america and eastern asia it had a much wider distribution in the past populations were present across eurasia into western europe during the late pleistocene and survived into the early holocene in southern sweden and the alps the elk has adapted well in countries where it has been introduced including argentina and new zealand its adaptability may in fact threaten endemic species and the ecosystems into which it has been introduced elk are susceptible to a number of infectious diseases some of which can be transmitted to livestock efforts to eliminate infectious diseases from elk populations largely by vaccination have had mixed success some cultures revere the elk as having spiritual significance in parts of asia antlers and their velvet are used in traditional medicines elk are hunted as a game species their meat is leaner and higher in protein than beef or chicken elk were long believed to belong to a subspecies of the european red deer cervus elaphus but evidence from many mitochondrial dna genetic studies beginning in shows that the two are distinct species key morphological differences that distinguish c canadensis from c elaphus are the former wider rump patch and antlers naming and etymology early european explorers in north america who were familiar with the smaller red deer of europe thought that the larger north american animal resembled a moose and consequently gave it the name elk which is the common european name for moose the word elk is related to the latin alces old norse elgr scandinavian and german elch all of which refer to the animal known in north america as the moosethe name wapiti is from the shawnee and cree word waapiti meaning white rump this name is used in particular for the asian subspecies the altai wapiti tian shan wapiti manchurian wapiti and alashan wapiti because in eurasia the name elk continues to be used for the moose the asian subspecies are sometimes referred to as the maral but this name applies primarily to the caspian red deer cervus elaphus maral a subspecies of the red deer there is a subspecies of wapiti in mongolia called the altai wapiti cervus canadensis sibiricus also known as the altai maral taxonomy members of the genus cervus and hence early relatives or possible ancestors of the elk first appear in the fossil record million years ago during the oligocene in eurasia but do not appear in the north american fossil record until the early miocene the extinct irish elk megaloceros was not a member of the genus cervus but rather the largest member of the wider deer family cervidae known from the fossil recorduntil recently red deer and elk were considered to be one species cervus elaphus however mitochondrial dna studies conducted on hundreds of samples in from red deer and elk subspecies as well as other species of the cervus deer family strongly indicate that elk or wapiti should be a distinct species namely cervus canadensis the previous classification had over a dozen subspecies under the c elaphus species designation dna evidence concludes that elk are more closely related to thorold deer and even sika deer than they are to the red deer elk and red deer produce fertile offspring in captivity and the two species have freely in new zealand fiordland national park where the animals have all but removed the pure elk blood from the area key morphological differences that distinguish c canadensis from c elaphus are the former wider rump patch and antlers subspecies there are numerous subspecies of elk described with six from north america and four from asia although some taxonomists consider them different ecotypes or races of the same species adapted to local environments through minor changes in appearance and behavior populations vary in antler shape and size body size coloration and mating behavior dna investigations of the eurasian subspecies revealed that phenotypic variation in antlers mane and rump patch development are based on lifestyle factors of the six subspecies of elk known to have inhabited north america in historical times four remain including the roosevelt c canadensis roosevelti tule c canadensis nannodes manitoban c canadensis manitobensis and rocky mountain elk c canadensis nelsoni the eastern elk c canadensis canadensis and merriam elk c canadensis merriami subspecies have been extinct for at least a centuryfour subspecies described in asia include the altai wapiti c canadensis sibiricus and the tianshan wapiti c canadensis songaricus two distinct subspecies found in china and korea are the manchurian wapiti c canadensis xanthopygus and the alashan wapitis c canadensis alashanicus the manchurian wapiti is darker and more reddish in coloration than the other populations the alashan wapiti of north central china is the smallest of all subspecies has the lightest coloration and is the least studied biologist valerius geist who has written on the world various deer species holds that there are only three subspecies of elk geist recognizes the manchurian and alashan wapiti but places all other elk into c canadensis canadensis claiming that classification of the four surviving north american groups as subspecies is driven at least partly for political purposes to secure individualized conservation and protective measures for each of the surviving populationsrecent dna studies suggest that there are no more than three or four subspecies of elk all american forms aside from possibly the tule and roosevelt elk seem to belong to one subspecies cervus canadensis canadensis even the siberian elk cervus canadensis sibiricus are more or less identical to the american forms and therefore may belong to this subspecies too however the manchurian wapiti cervus canadensis xanthopygus is clearly distinct from the siberian forms but not distinguishable from the alashan wapiti the chinese forms the sichuan deer kansu red deer and tibetan red deer belong also to the wapitis and were not distinguishable from each other by mitochondrial dna studies these chinese subspecies are sometimes treated as a distinct species namely the central asian red deer cervus wallichi which also includes the kashmir stag north american group roosevelt elk c c roosevelti tule elk c c nannodes manitoban elk c c manitobensis rocky mountain elk c c nelsoni eastern

southern group central asian red deer sichuan deer c c macneilli kansu red deer c c kansuensis tibetan red deer c c wallichii kashmir stag c c hanglu anatomy the elk is a large animal of the ungulate order artiodactyla possessing an even number of toes on each foot similar to those of camels goats and cattle it is a ruminant species with a stomach and feeds on grasses plants leaves and bark during the summer elk eat almost constantly consuming between and kilograms and lb of vegetation daily in north america males are called bulls and females are called cows in asia stag and hind respectively are sometimes used instead elk are more than twice as heavy as mule deer and have a more reddish hue to their hair coloring as well as large rump patches and smaller tails moose are larger and darker than elk bulls have distinctively different antlers elk gather in herds while moose are solitary elk cows average to kg to lb stand m ft at the wither and are m ft from nose to tail bulls are some larger than cows at maturity weighing an average of to kg to lb standing m ft at the wither and averaging m ft in length while large males reach m ft tall at wither and m ft in length the largest of the subspecies is the roosevelt elk c c roosevelti found west of the cascade range in the us states of california oregon and washington and in the canadian province of british columbia roosevelt elk have been reintroduced into alaska where the largest males are estimated to weigh up to kg lb more typically male roosevelt elk weigh around to kg to lb while females weigh to kg to lb the subspecies is the tule elk c c nannodes which weighs from to kg to lb in both sexesonly the males have antlers which start growing in the spring and are shed each winter the largest antlers may be meters ft long and weigh kilograms lb antlers are made of bone which can grow at a rate of centimeters in per day while actively growing the antlers are covered with and protected by a soft layer of highly vascularised skin known as velvet the velvet is shed in the summer when the antlers have fully developed bull elk may have eight or more tines on each antler however the number of tines has little to do with the age or maturity of a particular animal the siberian and north american elk carry the largest antlers while the altai wapiti have the smallest the formation and retention of antlers is after the breeding season in late fall the level of pheromones released during estrus declines in the environment and the testosterone levels of males drop as a consequence this drop in testosterone leads to the shedding of antlers usually in the early winter during the fall elk grow a thicker coat of hair which helps to insulate them during the winter males females and calves of siberian and north american elk all grow thin neck manes female and young manchurian and alaskan wapitis do not by early summer the heavy winter coat has been shed and elk are known to rub against trees and other objects to help remove hair from their bodies all elk have small and clearly defined rump patches with short tails they have different coloration based on the seasons and types of habitats with gray or lighter coloration prevalent in the winter and a more reddish darker coat in the summer subspecies living in arid climates tend to have lighter colored coats than do those living in forests most have lighter to coats in contrast to dark brown hair on the head neck and legs during the summer manchurian and alaskan wapitis have darker coats with less contrast between the body coat and the rest of the body during the summer months calves are born spotted as is common with many deer species and they lose their spots by the end of summer adult manchurian wapiti may retain a few orange spots on the back of their summer coats until they are older this characteristic has also been observed in the european red deer behavior adult elk usually stay in groups for most of the year during the mating period known as the rut mature bulls compete for the attention of the cow elk and will try to fend off rival bulls from their harem rival bulls challenge opponents by bellowing or bugling and by paralleling each other walking back and forth this allows potential combatants to assess the other antlers body size and fighting prowess if neither bull backs down they engage in antler wrestling and bulls sometimes sustain serious injuries bulls also dig holes in the ground called wallows in which they urinate and roll their body a male elk urethra points upward so that urine is sprayed almost at a right angle to the penis the urine soaks into their hair and gives them a distinct smell which attracts cowsdominant bulls follow groups of cows during the rut from august into early winter a bull will defend his harem of cows or more from competing bulls and predators it is only the mature bulls that usually have large harems and breeding success peaks at about eight years of age bulls between two and four years and over years of age rarely have harems and spend most of the rut on the periphery of larger harems young and old bulls that do acquire a harem usually acquire it later in the breeding season than do bulls in their prime a bull with a harem rarely feeds and he may lose up to percent of his body weight during the rut bulls that enter the rut in poor condition are less likely to keep their harems through to the peak conception period or have the strength to survive the rigors of the oncoming winterbulls have a loud vocalization consisting of screams known as bugling which can be heard for miles bugling is often associated with an adaptation to open environments such as parklands meadows and savannas where sound can travel great distances females are attracted to the males that bugle more often and have the loudest call unusual for a vocalization produced by a large animal buglings can reach a frequency of hz this is achieved by blowing air from the glottis through the nasal cavities elk can produce deeper pitched hz sounds using the larynx reproduction and lifecycle female elk have a short estrus cycle of only a day or two and matings usually involve a dozen or more attempts by the autumn of their second year females can produce one and very rarely two offspring although reproduction is most common when cows weigh at least kilograms lb the gestation period is to days and the offspring weigh between and kilograms and lb when the females are near to giving birth they tend to isolate themselves from the main herd and will remain isolated until the calf is large enough to escape predators calves are born spotted as is common with many deer species and they lose their spots by the end of summer manchurian wapiti may retain a few orange spots on the back of their summer coats until they are older after two weeks calves are able to join the herd and are fully weaned at two months of age elk calves are as large as an adult deer by the time they are six months old the offspring will remain with their mothers for almost a year leaving about the time that the next season offspring are produced the gestation period is the same for all subspecies elk live years or more in captivity but average to years in the wild in some subspecies that suffer less predation they may live an average of years in the wild predators and defensive tactics in north america wolf and coyote packs and the solitary cougar are the most likely predators although brown and black bears also prey on elk coyote packs mostly prey on elk calves though they can sometimes take a or adult in the greater yellowstone ecosystem which includes yellowstone national park bears are the most significant predators of calves although grizzlies have been documented to hunt elk there are no documented cases when mature healthy bulls are killed by grizzlies however they do occasionally kill the bears insteadmale elk retain their antlers for more than half the year and are less likely to group with other males when they have antlers antlers provide a means of defense as does a strong kick which is performed by either sex if provoked once the antlers have been shed bulls tend to form bachelor groups which allow them to work cooperatively at fending off predators herds tend to employ one or more scouts while the remaining members eat and restafter the rut females form large herds of up to individuals newborn calves are kept close by a series of vocalizations larger nurseries have an ongoing and constant chatter during the daytime hours when approached by predators the largest and most robust females may make a stand using their front legs to kick at their attackers guttural grunts and posturing effectively deter all but the most determined predatorswapiti in new zealand have no natural predators migration as is true for many species of deer especially those in mountainous regions elk migrate into areas of higher altitude in the spring following the retreating snows and the opposite direction in the fall hunting pressure also impacts migration and movements during the winter they favor wooded areas and sheltered valleys for protection from the wind and availability of tree bark to eat roosevelt elk are generally due to less seasonal variability of food sourcesthe greater yellowstone ecosystem elk herd numbers over individuals and during the spring and fall they take part in the longest elk migration in the continental us elk in the southern regions of yellowstone national park and in the surrounding national forests migrate south towards the town of jackson wyoming where they winter for up to six months on the national elk refuge conservationists there ensure the herd is well fed during the harsh winters many of the elk that reside in the northern sections of the greater yellowstone ecosystem migrate to lower altitudes in montana mainly to the north and west diet elk are ruminants and therefore have stomachs unlike deer and moose which are primarily browsers elk are similar to cattle in that they are primarily grazers but like other deer they also browse elk have a tendency to do most of their feeding in the mornings and evenings seeking sheltered areas in between feedings to digest their diets vary somewhat depending on the season with native grasses being a supplement tree bark being consumed in winter and forbs and tree sprouts during the summer elk consume an average of kilograms lb of various vegetation daily particularly fond of aspen sprouts which rise in the spring elk have had some impact on aspen groves which have been declining in some regions where elk existrange and wildlife managers conduct surveys of elk pellet groups to monitor populations and resource use parasites and disease at least species of protist and animal parasites have been identified in elk most of these parasites seldom lead to significant mortality among wild or captive elk parelaphostrongylus tenuis brainworm or meningeal worm is a parasitic nematode known to affect the spinal cord and brain tissue of elk and other species leading to death the definitive host is the deer in which it normally has no ill effects snails and slugs the intermediate hosts can be inadvertently consumed by elk during grazing the liver fluke fascioloides magna and the nematode dictyocaulus viviparus are also commonly found parasites that can be fatal to elk since infection by either of these parasites can be lethal to some commercial livestock species their presence in elk herds is of some concern chronic wasting disease transmitted by a misfolded protein known as a prion affects the brain tissue in elk and has been detected throughout their range in north america first documented in the late in mule deer the disease has affected elk on game farms and in the wild in a number of regions elk that have contracted the disease begin to show weight loss increased watering needs disorientation and listlessness and at an advanced stage the disease leads to death the disease is similar to but not the same as mad cow disease and no risks to humans have been documented nor has the disease been demonstrated to pose a threat to domesticated cattle in south korea banned the importation of elk antler velvet due to concerns about chronic wasting diseasethe bacterial disease brucellosis occasionally affects elk in the greater yellowstone ecosystem the only place in the us where the disease is still known to exist in domesticated cattle brucellosis causes infertility abortions and reduced milk production it is transmitted to humans as undulant fever producing symptoms that may last for years though bison are more likely to transmit the disease to other animals elk inadvertently transmitted brucellosis to horses in wyoming and cattle in idaho researchers are attempting to eradicate the disease through vaccinations and measures which are expected to be successful nevertheless research has been ongoing since and a successful vaccine has yet to be developed as of recent necropsy study of captive elk in pennsylvania attributed the cause of death in of cases to either gastrointestinal parasites cases primarily eimeria sp and ostertagia sp or bacterial infections cases mostly pneumonia elk hoof disease was first noticed in the state of washington in the late in the cowlitz river basin with sporadic reports of deformed hooves since then the disease has spread rapidly with increased sightings throughout southwest washington and into oregon the disease is characterised by deformed broken or missing hooves and leads to severe lameness in elk the primary cause is not known but it is associated with treponeme bacteria which are known to cause digital dermatitis in commercial livestock the mode of transmission is also not known but it appears to be highly contagious among elk studies are being undertaken by government departments to determine how to halt or eliminate the disease ecology distribution modern subspecies are descended from elk that once inhabited beringia a steppe region between asia and north america that connected the two continents during the pleistocene beringia provided a migratory route for numerous mammal species including brown bear camel horse caribou and moose as well as humans as the pleistocene came to an end ocean levels began to rise elk migrated southwards into asia and north america in north america they adapted to almost all ecosystems except for tundra true deserts and the gulf coast of the us the elk of southern siberia and central asia were once more widespread but today are restricted to the mountain ranges west of lake baikal including the sayan and altai mountains of mongolia and the tianshan region that borders kyrgyzstan kazakhstan and china xinjiang province the habitat of siberian elk in asia is similar to that of the rocky mountain subspecies in north america during the late pleistocene their range was much more extensive being distributed across eurasia with remains being found as far west as france these populations are most closely related to modern asian populations of the elk their range collapsed at the start of the holocene due to them being specialized to cold periglacial tundrasteppe habitat which was largely replaced with closed forest being outcompeted by red deer in these conditions relictual populations survived into the early holocene in southern sweden and the alps where the environment remained favorablethroughout their range they live in forest and in forest edge habitat similar to other deer species in mountainous regions they often dwell at higher elevations in summer migrating down slope for winter the highly adaptable elk also inhabit in north america such as the great basin manchurian and alashan wapiti are primarily forest dwellers and their smaller antler size is a likely adaptation to a forest environment introductions the rocky mountain elk subspecies has been reintroduced by organizations in the appalachian region of the eastern us where the now extinct eastern elk once lived after elk were reintroduced in the states of kentucky north carolina and tennessee they migrated into the neighboring states of virginia and west virginia and have established permanent populations there in a male elk likely from the smoky mountains population was sighted in south carolina for the first time in nearly years elk have also been reintroduced to a number of other states including pennsylvania michigan wisconsin missouri and etolin and afognak islands in alaska reintroduction of the elk into ontario began in the early century and is ongoing with limited success as of population figures for the rocky mountain subspecies were and estimated numbers for all north american subspecies exceeded million prior to the european colonization of north america there were an estimated million elk on the continentoutside their native habitat elk and other deer species especially deer were introduced in areas that previously had few if any large native ungulates brought to these countries for hunting and ranching for meat hides and antler velvet they have proven highly adaptable and have often had an adverse impact on local ecosystems elk and red deer were introduced to argentina in the early century there they are now considered an invasive species encroaching on argentinian ecosystems where they compete for food with the indigenous chilean huemul and other herbivores this negative impact on native animal species has led the iucn to identify the elk as one of the world worst invadersthe introduction of deer to new zealand began in the middle of the century and current populations are primarily european red deer with only percent being elk there is significant hybridization of elk with the more numerous red deer to the extent that pure elk may no longer exist in the wild in new zealand these deer have had an adverse impact on forest regeneration of some plant species as they consume more palatable species which are replaced with those that are less favored by the elk the impact will be an alteration of the types of plants and trees found and in other animal and plant species dependent upon them as in chile and argentina the iucn has declared that red deer and elk populations in new zealand are an invasive species cultural references elk have played an important role in the cultural history of a number of peoples neolithic petroglyphs from asia depict female elk which have been interpreted as symbolizing life and sustenance they were also frequently overlaid with boats and associated with rivers suggesting that they also represented paths to the underworld petroglyphs of elk were carved into cliffs by the anasazi of the southwestern us hundreds of years ago the elk was of particular importance to the lakota and played a spiritual role in their society the male elk was admired for its ability to attract mates and lakota men will play a courting flute imitating a bulging elk to attract women men would like use elk antlers as love charms and wore clothes decorated with elk imagesthe rocky mountain elk is the official state animal for utah an image of an elk and a moose appear on the state seal and flag of michigan the benevolent and protective order of elks bpoe chose the elk as its namesake because a number of its attributes seemed appropriate for cultivation by members of the fraternity a representation of the majestic head of the male with its spreading antlers was adopted as the first badge of the order and is still the most conspicuous element of its copyrighted fraternal emblem a prized possession of many members of the bpoe are jewel encrusted gold mounted elk teeth which are actually ivory commercial uses although breakdown figures for each game species are not available in the national survey from the us fish and wildlife service hunting of wild elk is most likely the primary economic impactwhile elk are not generally harvested for meat production on a large scale some restaurants offer the meat as a specialty item and it is also available in some grocery stores the meat has a taste somewhere between beef and venison and is higher in protein and lower in fat and cholesterol than beef pork and chicken elk meat is also a good source of iron phosphorus and zinca male elk can produce to kilograms to lb of antler velvet annually and on ranches in the united states canada and new zealand this velvet is collected and sold to markets in east asia where it is used in medicine velvet is also considered by some cultures to be an aphrodisiac however consuming velvet from elk in north america may be risky since velvet from animals infected with chronic wasting disease may contain prions that could result in a human getting variant diseaseantlers are also used in artwork furniture and other novelty items all asian subspecies along with other deer have been raised for their antlers in central and eastern asia by han chinese turkic peoples tungusic peoples mongolians and koreans elk farms are relatively common in north america and new zealandelk hides have been used for thousands of years for tepee covering blankets clothing and footwear modern uses are more decorative but elk skin shoes gloves and belts are not uncommonsince the boy scouts of america have assisted employees at the national elk refuge in wyoming by collecting the antlers which are shed each winter the antlers are then auctioned with of the proceeds returned to the refuge in kilograms lb of antlers were auctioned bringing in over see also alashan wapiti altai wapiti elk farming manchurian wapiti manitoban elk rocky mountain
