the cat felis catus is a domestic species of small carnivorous mammal it is the only domesticated species in the family felidae and is often referred to as the domestic cat to distinguish it from the wild members of the family a cat can either be a house cat a farm cat or a feral cat the latter ranges freely and avoids human contact domestic cats are valued by humans for companionship and their ability to hunt rodents about cat breeds are recognized by various cat registriesthe cat is similar in anatomy to the other felid species it has a strong flexible body quick reflexes sharp teeth and retractable claws adapted to killing small prey its night vision and sense of smell are well developed cat communication includes vocalizations like meowing purring trilling hissing growling and grunting as well as body language it is a solitary hunter but a social species it can hear sounds too faint or too high in frequency for human ears such as those made by mice and other small mammals it is a predator that is most active at dawn and dusk it secretes and perceives pheromonesfemale domestic cats can have kittens from spring to late autumn with litter sizes often ranging from two to five kittens domestic cats are bred and shown at events as registered pedigreed cats a hobby known as cat fancy failure to control breeding of pet cats by spaying and neutering as well as abandonment of pets resulted in large numbers of feral cats worldwide contributing to the extinction of entire bird mammal and reptile species and evoking population controlcats were first domesticated in the near east around bce it was long thought that cat domestication was initiated in ancient egypt as since around bce veneration was given to cats in ancient egypt as of the domestic cat was the popular pet in the united states with million cats owned in the united kingdom around million cats lived in more than million households as of etymology and naming the origin of the english word old english catt is thought to be the late latin word cattus which was first used at the beginning of the century it was suggested that the word is derived from an egyptian precursor of coptic sh sau tomcat or its feminine form suffixed with the late latin word is also thought to be derived from languages the nubian word kaddiska wildcat and nobiin kadis are possible sources or cognates the nubian word may be a loan from arabic qatt qitt it is equally likely that the forms might derive from an ancient germanic word imported into latin and thence to greek and to syriac and arabic the word may be derived from germanic and northern european languages and ultimately be borrowed from uralic cf northern sami gadfi female stoat and hungarian holgy stoat from kadwa female of a furred animal the english puss extended as pussy and pussycat is attested from the century and may have been introduced from dutch poes or from low german puuskatte related to swedish kattepus or norwegian pus pusekatt similar forms exist in lithuanian puize and irish puisin or puiscin the etymology of this word is unknown but it may have simply arisen from a sound used to attract a cata male cat is called a tom or tomcat or a gib if neutered an unspayed female is called a queen especially in a context a juvenile cat is referred to as a kitten in early modern english the word kitten was interchangeable with the word catling a group of cats can be referred to as a clowder or a glaring taxonomy the scientific name felis catus was proposed by carl linnaeus in for a domestic catfelis catus domesticus was proposed by johann christian polycarp erxleben in daemon proposed by konstantin alekseevich satunin in was a black cat from the transcaucasus later identified as a domestic catin the international commission on zoological nomenclature ruled that the domestic cat is a distinct species namely felis catus in it was considered a subspecies of the european wildcat f silvestris catus following results of phylogenetic research in the iucn cat classification taskforce followed the recommendation of the iczn in regarding the domestic cat as a distinct species felis catus evolution the domestic cat is a member of the felidae a family that had a common ancestor about million years ago the genus felis diverged from the felidae around million years ago results of phylogenetic research confirm that the wild felis species evolved through sympatric or parapatric speciation whereas the domestic cat evolved through artificial selection the domesticated cat and its closest wild ancestor are both diploid organisms that possess chromosomes and roughly genes the leopard cat prionailurus bengalensis was tamed independently in china around bce this line of partially domesticated cats leaves no trace in the domestic cat populations of today domestication the earliest known indication for the taming of an african wildcat f lybica was excavated close by a human neolithic grave in shillourokambos southern cyprus dating to about to years before present since there is no evidence of native mammalian fauna on cyprus the inhabitants of this neolithic village most likely brought the cat and other wild mammals to the island from the middle eastern mainland scientists therefore assume that african wildcats were attracted to early human settlements in the fertile crescent by rodents in particular the house mouse mus musculus and were tamed by neolithic farmers this commensal relationship between early farmers and tamed cats lasted thousands of years as agricultural practices spread so did tame and domesticated cats wildcats of egypt contributed to the maternal gene pool of the domestic cat at a later time the earliest known evidence for the occurrence of the domestic cat in greece dates to around bce greek phoenician carthaginian and etruscan traders introduced domestic cats to southern europe during the roman empire they were introduced to corsica and sardinia before the beginning of the millennium by the century bce they were familiar animals around settlements in magna graecia and etruria by the end of the roman empire in the century the egyptian domestic cat lineage had arrived in a baltic sea port in northern germanyduring domestication cats have undergone only minor changes in anatomy and behavior and they are still capable of surviving in the wild several natural behaviors and characteristics of wildcats may have them for domestication as pets these traits include their small size social nature obvious body language love of play and relatively high intelligence captive leopardus cats may also display affectionate behavior toward humans but were not domesticated house cats often mate with feral cats producing hybrids such as the kellas cat in scotland hybridisation between domestic and other felinae species is also possibledevelopment of cat breeds started in the mid century an analysis of the domestic cat genome revealed that the ancestral wildcat genome was significantly altered in the process of domestication as specific mutations were selected to develop cat breeds most breeds are founded on domestic cats genetic diversity of these breeds varies between regions and is lowest in purebred populations which show more than deleterious genetic disorders characteristics size the domestic cat has a smaller skull and shorter bones than the european wildcat it averages about cm in in length and cm in in height with about cm in long tails males are larger than females adult domestic cats typically weigh between and kg and lb skeleton cats have seven cervical vertebrae as do most mammals thoracic vertebrae humans have seven lumbar vertebrae humans have five three sacral vertebrae as do most mammals but humans have five and a variable number of caudal vertebrae in the tail humans have only vestigial caudal vertebrae fused into an internal coccyx the extra lumbar and thoracic vertebrae account for the cat spinal mobility and flexibility attached to the spine are ribs the shoulder and the pelvis unlike human arms cat forelimbs are attached to the shoulder by clavicle bones which allow them to pass their body through any space into which they can fit their head skull the cat skull is unusual among mammals in having very large eye sockets and a powerful specialized jaw within the jaw cats have teeth adapted for killing prey and tearing meat when it overpowers its prey a cat delivers a lethal neck bite with its two long canine teeth inserting them between two of the prey vertebrae and severing its spinal cord causing irreversible paralysis and death compared to other felines domestic cats have narrowly spaced canine teeth relative to the size of their jaw which is an adaptation to their preferred prey of small rodents which have small vertebrae the premolar and first molar together compose the carnassial pair on each side of the mouth which efficiently shears meat into small pieces like a pair of scissors these are vital in feeding since cats small molars can not chew food effectively and cats are largely incapable of mastication although cats tend to have better teeth than most humans with decay generally less likely because of a thicker protective layer of enamel a less damaging saliva less retention of food particles between teeth and a diet mostly devoid of sugar they are nonetheless subject to occasional tooth loss and infection ambulation the cat is digitigrade it walks on the toes with the bones of the feet making up the lower part of the visible leg unlike most mammals it uses a pacing gait and moves both legs on one side of the body before the legs on the other side it registers directly by placing each hind paw close to the track of the corresponding fore paw minimizing noise and visible tracks this also provides sure footing for hind paws when navigating rough terrain as it speeds up walking to trotting its gait changes to a diagonal gait the diagonally opposite hind and fore legs move simultaneously claws cats have protractable and retractable claws in their normal relaxed position the claws are sheathed with the skin and fur around the paw toe pads this keeps the claws sharp by preventing wear from contact with the ground and allows the silent stalking of prey the claws on the fore feet are typically sharper than those on the hind feet cats can voluntarily extend their claws on one or more paws they may extend their claws in hunting or climbing kneading or for extra traction on soft surfaces cats shed the outside layer of their claw sheaths when scratching rough surfacesmost cats have five claws on their front paws and four on their rear paws the dewclaw is proximal to the other claws more proximally is a protrusion which appears to be a sixth finger this special feature of the front paws on the inside of the wrists has no function in normal walking but is thought to be an antiskidding device used while jumping some cat breeds are prone to having extra digits polydactyly polydactylous cats occur along north america northeast coast and in great britain senses vision cats have excellent night vision and can see at only the light level required for human vision this is partly the result of cat eyes having a tapetum lucidum which reflects any light that passes through the retina back into the eye thereby increasing the eye sensitivity to dim light large pupils are an adaptation to dim light the domestic cat has slit pupils which allow it to focus bright light without chromatic aberration at low light a cat pupils expand to cover most of the exposed surface of its eyes however the domestic cat has rather poor color vision and only two types of cone cells optimized for sensitivity to blue and yellowish green its ability to distinguish between red and green is limited a response to middle wavelengths from a system other than the rod cells might be due to a third type of cone however this appears to be an adaptation to low light levels rather than representing true trichromatic vision hearing the domestic cat hearing is most acute in the range of hz to khz it can detect an extremely broad range of frequencies ranging from hz to hz it can hear a range of octaves while humans and dogs can hear ranges of about octaves its hearing sensitivity is enhanced by its large movable outer ears the pinnae which amplify sounds and help detect the location of a noise it can detect ultrasound which enables it to detect ultrasonic calls made by rodent prey smell cats have an acute sense of smell due in part to their olfactory bulb and a large surface of olfactory mucosa about square centimetres square inch in area which is about twice that of humans cats and many other animals have a jacobson organ in their mouths that is used in the behavioral process of flehmening it allows them to sense certain aromas in a way that humans can not cats are sensitive to pheromones such as which they use to communicate through urine spraying and marking with scent glands many cats also respond strongly to plants that contain nepetalactone especially catnip as they can detect that substance at less than one part per billion about of cats are affected by nepetalactone this response is also produced by other plants such as silver vine actinidia polygama and the herb valerian it may be caused by the smell of these plants mimicking a pheromone and stimulating cats social or sexual behaviors taste cats have relatively few taste buds compared to humans or so versus more than on the human tongue domestic and wild cats share a taste receptor gene mutation that keeps their sweet taste buds from binding to sugary molecules leaving them with no ability to taste sweetness their taste buds instead respond to acids amino acids like protein and bitter tastes cats also have a distinct temperature preference for their food preferring food with a temperature around which is similar to that of a fresh kill and routinely rejecting food presented cold or refrigerated which would signal to the cat that the prey item is long dead and therefore possibly toxic or decomposing whiskers to aid with navigation and sensation cats have dozens of movable whiskers vibrissae over their body especially their faces these provide information on the width of gaps and on the location of objects in the dark both by touching objects directly and by sensing air currents they also trigger protective blink reflexes to protect the eyes from damage balance most breeds of cat have a noted fondness for sitting in high places or perching a higher place may serve as a concealed site from which to hunt domestic cats strike prey by pouncing from a perch such as a tree branch another possible explanation is that height gives the cat a better observation point allowing it to survey its territory a cat falling from heights of up to meters can right itself and land on its paws during a fall from a high place a cat reflexively twists its body and rights itself to land on its feet using its acute sense of balance and flexibility this reflex is known as the cat righting reflex a cat always rights itself in the same way during a fall if it has enough time to do so which is the case in falls of cm ft in or more how cats are able to right themselves when falling has been investigated as the falling cat problem behavior outdoor cats are active both day and night although they tend to be slightly more active at night domestic cats spend the majority of their time in the vicinity of their homes but can range many hundreds of meters from this central point they establish territories that vary considerably in size in one study ranging from to hectares acres the timing of cats activity is quite flexible and varied which means house cats may be more active in the morning and evening as a response to greater human activity at these timescats conserve energy by sleeping more than most animals especially as they grow older the daily duration of sleep varies usually between and hours with and being the average some cats can sleep as much as hours the term cat nap for a short rest refers to the cat tendency to fall asleep lightly for a brief period while asleep cats experience short periods of rapid eye movement sleep often accompanied by muscle twitches which suggests they are dreaming sociability the social behavior of the domestic cat ranges from widely dispersed individuals to feral cat colonies that gather around a food source based on groups of females within such groups one cat is usually dominant over the others each cat in a colony holds a distinct territory with sexually active males having the largest territories which are about times larger than those of female cats and may overlap with several females territories these territories are marked by urine spraying by rubbing objects at head height with secretions from facial glands and by defecation between these territories are neutral areas where cats watch and greet one another without territorial conflicts outside these neutral areas territory holders usually chase away stranger cats at first by staring hissing and growling and if that does not work by short but noisy and violent attacks despite some cats cohabiting in colonies they do not have a social survival strategy or a pack mentality and always hunt alonehowever some pet cats are poorly socialized in particular older cats show aggressiveness towards newly arrived kittens which include biting and scratching this type of behavior is known as feline asocial aggressionlife in proximity to humans and other domestic animals has led to a symbiotic social adaptation in cats and cats may express great affection toward humans or other animals ethologically the human keeper of a cat functions as a sort of surrogate for the cat mother adult cats live their lives in a kind of extended kittenhood a form of behavioral neoteny their sounds may mimic the cries of a hungry human infant making them particularly difficult for humans to ignoredomestic cats scent rubbing behavior towards humans or other cats is thought to be a feline means for social bonding communication domestic cats use many vocalizations for communication including purring trilling hissing grunting and several different forms of meowing their body language including position of ears and tail relaxation of the whole body and kneading of the paws are all indicators of mood the tail and ears are particularly important social signal mechanisms in cats a raised tail indicates a friendly greeting and flattened ears indicates hostility also indicates the cat position in the group social hierarchy with dominant individuals raising their tails less often than subordinate ones feral cats are generally silent touching is also a common greeting and may be followed by social grooming which is solicited by one of the cats raising and tilting its headpurring may have developed as an evolutionary advantage as a signalling mechanism of reassurance between mother cats and nursing kittens cats often purr as a sign of contentment when being petted becoming relaxed or eating the mechanism by which cats purr is elusive the cat has no unique anatomical feature that is clearly responsible for the sound grooming cats are known for spending considerable amounts of time licking their coats to keep them clean the cat tongue has spines about mm long which are called papillae these contain keratin which makes them rigid so the papillae act like a hairbrush some cats particularly longhaired cats occasionally regurgitate hairballs of fur that have collected in their stomachs from grooming these clumps of fur are usually and about cm in long hairballs can be prevented with remedies that ease elimination of the hair through the gut as well as regular grooming of the coat with a comb or stiff brush fighting among domestic cats males are more likely to fight than females among feral cats the most common reason for cat fighting is competition between two males to mate with a female in such cases most fights are won by the heavier male another common reason for fighting in domestic cats is the difficulty of establishing territories within a small home female cats also fight over territory or to defend their kittens neutering will decrease or eliminate this behavior in many cases suggesting that the behavior is linked to sex hormoneswhen cats become aggressive they try to make themselves appear larger and more threatening by raising their fur arching their backs turning sideways and hissing or spitting often the ears are pointed down and back to avoid damage to the inner ear and potentially listen for any changes behind them while focused forward they may also vocalize loudly and bare their teeth in an effort to further intimidate their opponent fights usually consist of grappling and delivering powerful slaps to the face and body with the forepaws as well as bites cats also throw themselves to the ground in a defensive posture to rake their opponent belly with their powerful hind legsserious damage is rare as the fights are usually short in duration with the loser running away with little more than a few scratches to the face and ears however fights for mating rights are typically more severe and injuries may include deep puncture wounds and lacerations normally serious injuries from fighting are limited to infections of scratches and bites though these can occasionally kill cats if untreated in addition bites are probably the main route of transmission of feline immunodeficiency virus sexually active males are usually involved in many fights during their lives and often have decidedly battered faces with obvious scars and cuts to their ears and nose hunting and feeding the shape and structure of cats cheeks is insufficient to suck they lap with the tongue to draw liquid upwards into their mouths lapping at a rate of four times a second the cat touches the smooth tip of its tongue to the surface of the water and quickly retracts it like a corkscrew drawing water upwardsferal cats and house cats consume several small meals in a day the frequency and size of meals varies between individuals they select food based on its temperature smell and texture they dislike chilled foods and respond most strongly to moist foods rich in amino acids which are similar to meat cats reject novel flavors a response termed neophobia and learn quickly to avoid foods that have tasted unpleasant in the past they also avoid sweet food and milk most adult cats are lactose intolerant the sugar in milk is not easily digested and may cause soft stools or diarrhea some also develop odd eating habits and like to eat or chew on things like wool plastic cables paper string aluminum foil or even coal this condition pica can threaten their health depending on the amount and toxicity of the items eatencats hunt small prey primarily birds and rodents and are often used as a form of pest control cats use two hunting strategies either stalking prey actively or waiting in ambush until an animal comes close enough to be captured the strategy used depends on the prey species in the area with cats waiting in ambush outside burrows but tending to actively stalk birds domestic cats are a major predator of wildlife in the united states killing an estimated to billion birds and to billion mammals annually certain species appear more susceptible than others for example of house sparrow mortality is linked to the domestic cat in the recovery of ringed robins erithacus rubecula and dunnocks prunella modularis of deaths were a result of cat predation in parts of north america the presence of larger carnivores such as coyotes which prey on cats and other small predators reduces the effect of predation by cats and other small predators such as opossums and raccoons on bird numbers and variety perhaps the element of cats hunting behavior which is commonly misunderstood and often appalls cat owners because it looks like torture is that cats often appear to play with prey by releasing it after capture this cat and mouse behavior is due to an instinctive imperative to ensure that the prey is weak enough to be killed without endangering the cat another poorly understood element of cat hunting behavior is the presentation of prey to human guardians one explanation is that cats adopt humans into their social group and share excess kill with others in the group according to the dominance hierarchy in which humans are reacted to as if they are at or near the top another explanation is that they attempt to teach their guardians to hunt or to help their human as if feeding an elderly cat or an inept kitten this hypothesis is inconsistent with the fact that male cats also bring home prey despite males having negligible involvement in raising kittens impact on wildlife on islands birds can contribute as much as of a cat diet in nearly all cases however the cat can not be identified as the sole cause for reducing the numbers of island birds and in some instances eradication of cats has caused a mesopredator release effect where the suppression of top carnivores creates an abundance of smaller predators that cause a severe decline in their shared prey domestic cats are however known to be a contributing factor to the decline of many species a factor that has ultimately led in some cases to extinction the south island piopio chatham rail and the new zealand merganser are a few from a long list with the most extreme case being the flightless lyall wren which was driven to extinction only a few years after its discovery one feral cat in new zealand killed new zealand lesser bats in seven days in the us feral and domestic cats kill an estimated billion mammals annuallyin australia the impact of cats on mammal populations is even greater than the impact of habitat loss more than one million reptiles are killed by feral cats each day representing species cats have contributed to the extinction of the navassa lizard and chioninia coctei play domestic cats especially young kittens are known for their love of play this behavior mimics hunting and is important in helping kittens learn to stalk capture and kill prey cats also engage in play fighting with each other and with humans this behavior may be a way for cats to practice the skills needed for real combat and might also reduce any fear they associate with launching attacks on other animalscats also tend to play with toys more when they are hungry owing to the close similarity between play and hunting cats prefer to play with objects that resemble prey such as small furry toys that move rapidly but rapidly lose interest they become habituated to a toy they have played with before string is often used as a toy but if it is eaten it can become caught at the base of the cat tongue and then move into the intestines a medical emergency which can cause serious illness even death owing to the risks posed by cats eating string it is sometimes replaced with a laser pointer dot which cats may chase reproduction female cats called queens are polyestrous with several estrus cycles during a year lasting usually days they are usually ready to mate between early february and augustseveral males called tomcats are attracted to a female in heat they fight over her and the victor wins the right to mate at first the female rejects the male but eventually the female allows the male to mate the female utters a loud yowl as the male pulls out of her because a male cat penis has a band of about penile spines which are about mm in long upon withdrawal of the penis the spines rake the walls of the female vagina which acts to induce ovulation this act also occurs to clear the vagina of other sperm in the context of a second or more mating thus giving the later males a larger chance of conceptionafter mating the female cleans her vulva thoroughly if a male attempts to mate with her at this point the female attacks him after about to minutes once the female is finished grooming the cycle will repeat because ovulation is not always triggered by a single mating females may not be impregnated by the first male with which they mate furthermore cats are superfecund that is a female may mate with more than one male when she is in heat with the result that different kittens in a litter may have different fathersthe morula forms hours after conception at hours early blastocysts form at days implantation occurs the gestation of queens lasts between and days with an average of days data on the reproductive capacity of more than queens were collected during a study between may and october they had one to six kittens per litter with an average of three kittens they produced a mean of litters per year but a maximum of three litters in a year of kittens died before they were six months old due to a trauma caused in most cases by dog attacks and road accidents the first litter is usually smaller than subsequent litters kittens are weaned between six and seven weeks of age queens normally reach sexual maturity at months and males at months this varies depending on breed kittens reach puberty at the age of monthscats are ready to go to new homes at about weeks of age when they are ready to leave their mother they can be surgically sterilized spayed or castrated as early as seven weeks to limit unwanted reproduction this surgery also prevents undesirable behavior such as aggression territory marking spraying urine in males and yowling calling in females traditionally this surgery was performed at around six to nine months of age but it is increasingly being performed before puberty at about three to six months in the united states about of household cats are neutered lifespan and health the average lifespan of pet cats has risen in recent decades in the early it was about seven years rising to years in and years in some cats have been reported as surviving into their with the oldest known cat creme puff dying at a verified age of or neutering increases life expectancy one study found neutered male cats live twice as long as intact males while spayed female cats live longer than intact females having a cat neutered confers health benefits because castrated males can not develop testicular cancer spayed females can not develop uterine or ovarian cancer and both have a reduced risk of mammary cancerdespite widespread concern about the welfare of cats the lifespans of neutered feral cats in managed colonies compare favorably with those of pet cats disease about two hundred fifty heritable genetic disorders have been identified in cats many similar to human inborn errors of metabolism the high level of similarity among the metabolism of mammals allows many of these feline diseases to be diagnosed using genetic tests that were originally developed for use in humans as well as the use of cats as animal models in the study of the human diseases diseases affecting domestic cats include acute infections parasitic infestations injuries and chronic diseases such as kidney disease thyroid disease and arthritis vaccinations are available for many infectious diseases as are treatments to eliminate parasites such as worms and fleas ecology habitats the domestic cat is a cosmopolitan species and occurs across much of the world it is adaptable and now present on all continents except antarctica and on of the main groups of on isolated islands such as the kerguelen islands due to its ability to thrive in almost any terrestrial habitat it is among the world most invasive species as it is little altered from the wildcat it can readily interbreed with the wildcat this hybridization poses a danger to the genetic distinctiveness of some wildcat populations particularly in scotland and hungary and possibly also the iberian peninsula it lives on small islands with no human inhabitants feral cats can live in forests grasslands tundra coastal areas agricultural land scrublands urban areas and wetlands feral cats feral cats are domestic cats that were born in or have reverted to a wild state they are unfamiliar with and wary of humans and roam freely in urban and rural areas the numbers of feral cats is not known but estimates of the united states feral population range from to sixty million feral cats may live alone but most are found in large colonies which occupy a specific territory and are usually associated with a source of food famous feral cat colonies are found in rome around the colosseum and forum romanum with cats at some of these sites being fed and given medical attention by volunteerspublic attitudes towards feral cats vary widely ranging from seeing them as pets to regarding them as vermin one common approach to reducing the feral cat population is termed where the cats are trapped neutered immunized against diseases such as rabies and the feline panleukopenia and leukemia viruses and then released before releasing them back into their feral colonies the attending veterinarian often nips the tip off one ear to mark it as neutered and inoculated since these cats may be trapped again volunteers continue to feed and give care to these cats throughout their lives given this support their lifespans are increased and behavior and nuisance problems caused by competition for food are reducedsome feral cats can be successfully socialised and for adoption young cats especially kittens and cats that have had prior experience and contact with humans are the most receptive to these efforts interaction with humans cats are common pets throughout the world and their worldwide population exceeds million as of cats have been used for millennia to control rodents notably around grain stores and aboard ships and both uses extend to the present dayas well as being kept as pets cats are also used in the international fur and leather industries for making coats hats blankets and stuffed toys and shoes gloves and musical instruments respectively about cats are needed to make a coat this use has been outlawed in the united states australia and the european union in cat pelts have been used for superstitious purposes as part of the practise of witchcraft and are still made into blankets in switzerland as folk remedies believed to help rheumatism in the western intellectual tradition the idea of cats as everyday objects have served to illustrate problems of quantum mechanics in the schrodinger cat thought experiment a few attempts to build a cat census have been made over the years both through associations or national and international organizations such as the canadian federation of humane societies one and over the internet but such a task does not seem simple to achieve general estimates for the global population of domestic cats range widely from anywhere between million to millionwalter chandoha made his career photographing cats after his images of loco an especially charming stray taken in were published around the world he is reported to have photographed cats during his career and maintained an archive of images that he drew from for publications during his lifetime cat show a cat show is a judged event in which the owners of cats compete to win titles in various organizations by entering their cats to be judged after a breed standard both pedigreed and companion moggy cats are admissible although the rules differ from organization to organization competing cats are compared to the applicable breed standard and assessed for temperament and apparent health the owners of those judged to be most ideal awarded a prize moggies are judged based on their temperament and healthy appearance some events also include activity judging such as trained navigation of obstacle course often at the end of the year all of the points accrued at various shows are added up and more national and regional titles are awarded to champion cats infections transmitted from cats to humans cats can be infected or infested with viruses bacteria fungus protozoans arthropods or worms that can transmit diseases to humans in some cases the cat exhibits no symptoms of the disease however the same disease can then become evident in a human the likelihood that a person will become diseased depends on the age and immune status of the person humans who have cats living in their home or in close association are more likely to become infected however those who do not keep cats as pets might also acquire infections from cat feces and parasites exiting the cat body some of the infections of most concern include salmonella disease and toxoplasmosis history and mythology in ancient egypt cats were worshipped and the goddess bastet often depicted in cat form sometimes taking on the aspect of a lioness the greek historian herodotus reported that killing a cat was forbidden and when a household cat died the entire family mourned and shaved their eyebrows families took their dead cats to the sacred city of bubastis where they were embalmed and buried in sacred repositories herodotus expressed astonishment at the domestic cats in egypt because he had only ever seen wildcats ancient greeks and romans kept weasels as pets which were seen as the ideal the earliest unmistakable evidence of the greeks having domestic cats comes from two coins from magna graecia dating to the century bc showing iokastos and phalanthos the legendary founders of rhegion and taras respectively playing with their pet cats the usual ancient greek word for was ailouros meaning with the waving tail cats are rarely mentioned in ancient greek literature aristotle remarked in his history of animals that female cats are naturally lecherous the greeks later syncretized their own goddess artemis with the egyptian goddess bastet adopting bastet associations with cats and ascribing them to artemis in ovid metamorphoses when the deities flee to egypt and take animal forms the goddess diana turns into a cat cats eventually displaced ferrets as the pest control of choice because they were more pleasant to have around the house and were more enthusiastic hunters of mice during the middle ages many of artemis associations with cats were grafted onto the virgin mary cats are often shown in icons of annunciation and of the holy family and according to italian folklore on the same night that mary gave birth to jesus a cat in bethlehem gave birth to a kitten domestic cats were spread throughout much of the rest of the world during the age of discovery as ships cats were carried on sailing ships to control shipboard rodents and as charmsseveral ancient religions believed cats are exalted souls companions or guides for humans that are but mute so they can not influence decisions made by humans in japan the maneki neko cat is a symbol of good fortune in norse mythology freyja the goddess of love beauty and fertility is depicted as riding a chariot drawn by cats in jewish legend the first cat was living in the house of the first man adam as a pet that got rid of mice the cat was once partnering with the first dog before the latter broke an oath they had made which resulted in enmity between the descendants of these two animals it is also written that neither cats nor foxes are represented in the water while every other animal has an incarnation species in the water although no species are sacred in islam cats are revered by muslims some western writers have stated muhammad had a favorite cat muezza he is reported to have loved cats so much he would do without his cloak rather than disturb one that was sleeping on it the story has no origin in early muslim writers and seems to confuse a story of a later sufi saint ahmed i centuries after muhammad one of the companions of muhammad was known as abu hurayrah father of the kitten in reference to his documented affection to cats superstitions and rituals many cultures have negative superstitions about cats an example would be the belief that a black cat crossing one path leads to bad luck or that cats are witches familiars used to augment a witch powers and skills the killing of cats in medieval ypres belgium is commemorated in the innocuous kattenstoet cat parade in medieval france cats would be burnt alive as a form of entertainment according to norman davies the assembled people shrieked with laughter as the animals howling with pain were singed roasted and finally carbonized james frazer wrote that it was the custom to burn a basket barrel or sack full of live cats which was hung from a tall mast in the midst of the bonfire sometimes a fox was burned the people collected the embers and ashes of the fire and took them home believing that they brought good luck the french kings often witnessed these spectacles and even lit the bonfire with their own hands in louis xiv crowned with a wreath of roses and carrying a bunch of roses in his hand kindled the fire danced at it and partook of the banquet afterwards in the town hall but this was the last occasion when a monarch presided at the midsummer bonfire in paris at metz midsummer fires were lighted with great pomp on the esplanade and a dozen cats enclosed in wicker cages were burned alive in them to the amusement of the people similarly at gap in the department of the cats used to be roasted over the midsummer bonfire according to a myth in many cultures cats have multiple lives in many countries they are believed to have nine lives but in italy germany greece brazil and some regions they are said to have seven lives while in turkish and arabic traditions the number of lives is six the myth is attributed to the natural suppleness and swiftness cats exhibit to escape situations also lending credence to this myth is the fact that falling cats often land on their feet using an instinctive righting reflex to twist their bodies around nonetheless cats can still be injured or killed by a high fall see
