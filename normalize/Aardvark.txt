the aardvark orycteropus afer is a burrowing nocturnal mammal native to africa it is the only living species of the order tubulidentata although other prehistoric species and genera of tubulidentata are known unlike other insectivores it has a long snout which is used to sniff out food it roams over most of the southern of the african continent avoiding areas that are mainly rocky a nocturnal feeder it subsists on ants and termites which it will dig out of their hills using its sharp claws and powerful legs it also digs to create burrows in which to live and rear its young it receives a least concern rating from the iucn although its numbers seem to be decreasing aardvarks are afrotheres a clade which also includes elephants manatees and hyraxes name and taxonomy name the aardvark is sometimes colloquially called african ant bear anteater not to be confused with the south american anteater or the cape anteater after the cape of good hope the name aardvark is afrikaans afrikaans pronunciation 'a:rtfark comes from earlier afrikaans erdvark and means earth pig or ground pig aarde vark pig because of its burrowing habits the name orycteropus means burrowing foot and the name afer refers to africa the name of the aardvarks order tubulidentata comes from the teeth taxonomy the aardvark is not closely related to the pig rather it is the sole extant representative of the obscure mammalian order tubulidentata in which it is usually considered to form one variable species of the genus orycteropus the sole surviving genus in the family orycteropodidae the aardvark is not closely related to the south american anteater despite sharing some characteristics and a superficial resemblance the similarities are based on convergent evolution the closest living relatives of the aardvark are the elephant shrews tenrecs and golden moles along with the sirenians hyraxes elephants and their extinct relatives these animals form the superorder afrotheria studies of the brain have shown the similarities with condylarthra and given the clade status as a wastebasket taxon it may mean some species traditionally classified as condylarths are actually evolutionary history based on fossils bryan patterson has concluded that early relatives of the aardvark appeared in africa around the end of the paleocene the ptolemaiidans a mysterious clade of mammals with uncertain affinities may actually be either as a sister clade to tubulidentata or as a grade leading to true tubulidentatesthe first unambiguous tubulidentate was probably myorycteropus africanus from kenyan miocene deposits the earliest example from the genus orycteropus was orycteropus mauritanicus found in algeria in deposits from the middle miocene with an equally old version found in kenya fossils from the aardvark have been dated to million years and have been located throughout europe and the near eastthe mysterious pleistocene plesiorycteropus from madagascar was originally thought to be a tubulidentate that was descended from ancestors that entered the island during the eocene however a number of subtle anatomical differences coupled with recent molecular evidence now lead researchers to believe that plesiorycteropus is a relative of golden moles and tenrecs that achieved an appearance and ecological niche through convergent evolution subspecies the aardvark has seventeen poorly defined subspecies listed orycteropus afer afer o a adametzi grote o a aethiopicus sundevall o a angolensis zukowsky haltenorth o a erikssoni lonnberg o a faradjius hatt o a haussanus matschie o a

wertheri matschie encyclopaedia britannica also mentions o a capensis or cape from south africa description the aardvark is vaguely in appearance its body is stout with a prominently arched back and is sparsely covered with coarse hairs the limbs are of moderate length with the rear legs being longer than the forelegs the front feet have lost the pollex or resulting in four toes while the rear feet have all five toes each toe bears a large robust nail which is somewhat flattened and and appears to be intermediate between a claw and a hoof whereas the aardvark is considered digitigrade it appears at time to be plantigrade this confusion happens because when it squats it stands on its soles a contributing characteristic to the burrow digging capabilities of aardvarks is an endosteal tissue called compacted coarse cancellous bone cccb the stress and strain resistance provided by cccb allows aardvarks to create their burrows ultimately leading to a favorable environment for plants and a variety of animalsan aardvark weight is typically between and kilograms lb an aardvark length is usually between and centimetres ft and can reach lengths of metres ft in when its tail which can be up to centimetres in is taken into account it is centimetres in tall at the shoulder and has a girth of about centimetres ft it is the largest member of the proposed clade afroinsectiphilia the aardvark is pale in color and often stained by soil the aardvark coat is thin and the animal primary protection is its tough skin its hair is short on its head and tail however its legs tend to have longer hair the hair on the majority of its body is grouped in clusters of hairs the hair surrounding its nostrils is dense to help filter particulate matter out as it digs its tail is very thick at the base and gradually tapers head the greatly elongated head is set on a short thick neck and the end of the snout bears a disc which houses the nostrils it contains a thin but complete zygomatic arch the head of the aardvark contains many unique and different features one of the most distinctive characteristics of the tubulidentata is their teeth instead of having a pulp cavity each tooth has a cluster of thin hexagonal upright parallel tubes of vasodentin a modified form of dentine with individual pulp canals held together by cementum the number of columns is dependent on the size of the tooth with the largest having about the teeth have no enamel coating and are worn away and regrow continuously the aardvark is born with conventional incisors and canines at the front of the jaw which fall out and are not replaced adult aardvarks have only cheek teeth at the back of the jaw and have a dental formula of these remaining teeth are and rootless and are of unique composition the teeth consist of upper and lower jaw molars the nasal area of the aardvark is another unique area as it contains ten nasal conchae more than any other placental mammalthe sides of the nostrils are thick with hair the tip of the snout is highly mobile and is moved by modified mimetic muscles the fleshy dividing tissue between its nostrils probably has sensory functions but it is uncertain whether they are olfactory or vibratory in nature its nose is made up of more turbinate bones than any other mammal with between and compared to dogs with to with a large quantity of turbinate bones the aardvark has more space for the moist epithelium which is the location of the olfactory bulb the nose contains nine olfactory bulbs more than any other mammal its keen sense of smell is not just from the quantity of bulbs in the nose but also in the development of the brain as its olfactory lobe is very developed the snout resembles an elongated pig snout the mouth is small and tubular typical of species that feed on ants and termites the aardvark has a long thin snakelike protruding tongue as much as centimetres in long and elaborate structures supporting a keen sense of smell the ears which are very effective are disproportionately long about centimetres in long the eyes are small for its head and consist only of rods digestive system the aardvark stomach has a muscular pyloric area that acts as a gizzard to grind swallowed food up thereby rendering chewing unnecessary its cecum is large both sexes emit a strong smelling secretion from an anal gland its salivary glands are highly developed and almost completely ring the neck their output is what causes the tongue to maintain its tackiness the female has two pairs of teats in the inguinal regiongenetically speaking the aardvark is a living fossil as its chromosomes are highly conserved reflecting much of the early eutherian arrangement before the divergence of the major modern taxa habitat and range aardvarks are found in africa where suitable habitat savannas grasslands woodlands and bushland and food ie ants and termites is available they spend the daylight hours in dark burrows to avoid the heat of the day the only major habitat that they are not present in is swamp forest as the high water table precludes digging to a sufficient depth they also avoid terrain rocky enough to cause problems with digging they have been documented as high as metres ft in ethiopia they are present throughout africa all the way to south africa with few exceptions these exceptions include the coastal areas of namibia ivory coast and ghana they are not found in madagascar ecology and behaviour aardvarks live for up to years in captivity its keen hearing warns it of predators lions leopards cheetahs african wild dogs hyenas and pythons some humans also hunt aardvarks for meat aardvarks can dig fast or run in zigzag fashion to elude enemies but if all else fails they will strike with their claws tail and shoulders sometimes flipping onto their backs lying motionless except to lash out with all four feet they are capable of causing substantial damage to unprotected areas of an attacker they will also dig to escape as they can when pressed dig extremely quickly feeding the aardvark is nocturnal and is a solitary creature that feeds almost exclusively on ants and termites myrmecophagy the only fruit eaten by aardvarks is the aardvark cucumber in fact the cucumber and the aardvark have a symbiotic relationship as they eat the subterranean fruit then defecate the seeds near their burrows which then grow rapidly due to the loose soil and fertile nature of the area the time spent in the intestine of the aardvark helps the fertility of the seed and the fruit provides needed moisture for the aardvark they avoid eating the african driver ant and red ants due to their stringent diet requirements they require a large range to survive an aardvark emerges from its burrow in the late afternoon or shortly after sunset and forages over a considerable home range encompassing to kilometres to mi while foraging for food the aardvark will keep its nose to the ground and its ears pointed forward which indicates that both smell and hearing are involved in the search for food they as they forage and will usually not repeat a route for days as they appear to allow time for the termite nests to recover before feeding on it againduring a foraging period they will stop and dig a v shaped trench with their forefeet and then sniff it profusely as a means to explore their location when a concentration of ants or termites is detected the aardvark digs into it with its powerful front legs keeping its long ears upright to listen for predators and takes up an astonishing number of insects with its long sticky many as in one night have been recorded its claws enable it to dig through the extremely hard crust of a termite or ant mound quickly it avoids inhaling the dust by sealing the nostrils when successful the aardvark long up to centimetres in tongue licks up the insects the termites biting or the ants stinging attacks are rendered futile by the tough skin after an aardvark visit at a termite mound other animals will visit to pick up all the leftovers termite mounds alone do provide enough food for the aardvark so they look for termites that are on the move when these insects move they can form columns metres ft long and these tend to provide easy pickings with little effort exerted by the aardvark these columns are more common in areas of livestock or other hoofed animals the trampled grass and dung attract termites from the odontotermes microtermes and pseudacanthotermes generaon a nightly basis they tend to be more active during the first portion of night roughly the four hours between pm and am however they do seem to prefer bright or dark nights over the other during adverse weather or if disturbed they will retreat to their burrow systems they cover between and kilometres and mi per night however some studies have shown that they may traverse as far as kilometres mi in a night vocalization the aardvark is a rather quiet animal however it does make soft grunting sounds as it forages and loud grunts as it makes for its tunnel entrance it makes a bleating sound if frightened when it is threatened it will make for one of its burrows if one is not close it will dig a new one rapidly this new one will be short and require the aardvark to back out when the coast is clear movement the aardvark is known to be a good swimmer and has been witnessed successfully swimming in strong currents it can dig a yard of tunnel in about five minutes but otherwise moves fairly slowly when leaving the burrow at night they pause at the entrance for about ten minutes sniffing and listening after this period of watchfulness it will bound out and within seconds it will be metres ft away it will then pause prick its ears twisting its head to listen then jump and move off to start foragingaside from digging out ants and termites the aardvark also excavates burrows in which to live which generally fall into one of three categories burrows made while foraging refuge and resting location and permanent homes temporary sites are scattered around the home range and are used as refuges while the main burrow is also used for breeding main burrows can be deep and extensive have several entrances and can be as long as metres ft these burrows can be large enough for a man to enter the aardvark changes the layout of its home burrow regularly and periodically moves on and makes a new one the old burrows are an important part of the african wildlife scene as they are vacated then they are inhabited by smaller animals like the african wild dog chat nycteris thebaica and warthogs other animals that use them are hares mongooses hyenas owls pythons and lizards without these refuges many animals would die during wildfire season only mothers and young share burrows however the aardvark is known to live in small family groups or as a solitary creature if attacked in the tunnel it will escape by digging out of the tunnel thereby placing the fresh fill between it and its predator or if it decides to fight it will roll onto its back and attack with its claws the aardvark has been known to sleep in a recently excavated ant nest which also serves as protection from its predators reproduction aardvarks pair only during the breeding season after a gestation period of seven months one cub weighing around kilograms lb is born during when born the young has flaccid ears and many wrinkles when nursing it will nurse off each teat in succession after two weeks the folds of skin disappear and after three the ears can be held upright after weeks body hair starts growing it is able to leave the burrow to accompany its mother after only two weeks and eats termites at weeks and is weaned between three months and weeks at six months of age it is able to dig its own burrows but it will often remain with the mother until the next mating season and is sexually mature from approximately two years of age conservation aardvarks were thought to have declining numbers however this is possibly because they are not readily seen there are no definitive counts because of their nocturnal and secretive habits however their numbers seem to be stable overall they are not considered common anywhere in africa but due to their large range they maintain sufficient numbers there may be a slight decrease in numbers in eastern northern and western africa southern african numbers are not decreasing it receives an official designation from the iucn as least concern however they are a species in a precarious situation as they are so dependent on such specific food therefore if a problem arises with the abundance of termites the species as a whole would be affected drasticallyaardvarks handle captivity well the first zoo to have one was london zoo in which had an animal from south africa mythology and popular culture in african folklore the aardvark is much admired because of its diligent quest for food and its fearless response to soldier ants hausa magicians make a charm from the heart skin forehead and nails of the aardvark which they then proceed to pound together with the root of a certain tree wrapped in a piece of skin and worn on the chest the charm is said to give the owner the ability to pass through walls or roofs at night the charm is said to be used by burglars and those seeking to visit young girls without their parents permission also some tribes such as the margbetu ayanda and logo will use aardvark teeth to make bracelets which are regarded as good luck charms the meat which has a resemblance to pork is eaten in certain culturesthe egyptian god set is usually depicted with the head of an unidentified animal whose similarity to an aardvark has been noted in scholarshipthe titular character of arthur an animated television series for children based on a book series and produced by wgbh shown in more than countries is an aardvarkotis the aardvark was a puppet character used on children bbc programming an aardvark features as the antagonist in the cartoon the ant and the aardvark as well as in the canadian animated series the raccoons in the military the air force supersonic was nicknamed the aardvark because of its long nose resembling the animal it also had similarities with its nocturnal missions flown at a very low level employing ordnance that could penetrate deep into the ground in
