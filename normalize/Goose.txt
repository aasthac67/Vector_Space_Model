a goose plural geese is a bird of any of several waterfowl species in the family anatidae this group comprises the genera anser the grey geese branta the black geese and chen which includes the white geese the latter sometimes being placed within the genus anser some other birds mostly related to the shelducks have goose as part of their names more distantly related members of the family anatidae are swans most of which are larger than true geese and ducks which are smaller the term goose is more properly used for a female bird while gander refers specifically to a male one young birds before fledging are called goslings the collective noun for a group of geese on the ground is a gaggle when in flight they are called a skein a team or a wedge when flying close together they are called a

greylag goose and domestic geese chen white geese sometimes included in anser such as the snow goose and branta black geese such as the canada goose two genera of geese are only tentatively placed in the anserinae they may belong to the shelducks or form a subfamily on their own cereopsis the cape barren goose and cnemiornis the prehistoric new zealand goose either these or more probably the coscoroba swan is the closest living relative of the true geese fossils of true geese are hard to assign to genus all that can be said is that their fossil record particularly in north america is dense and comprehensively documents many different species of true geese that have been around since about million years ago in the miocene the aptly named anser atavus meaning progenitor goose from some million years ago had even more plesiomorphies in common with swans in addition some birds are known from subfossil remains found on the hawaiian islands geese are monogamous living in permanent pairs throughout the year however unlike most other permanently monogamous animals they are territorial only during the short nesting season paired geese are more dominant and feed more two factors that result in more young other birds called geese some mainly southern hemisphere birds are called geese most of which belong to the shelduck subfamily tadorninae these are the orinoco goose neochen jubata the egyptian goose alopochen aegyptiaca the south american sheldgeese in the genus chloephaga the prehistoric malagasy sheldgoose centrornis majori others the goose plectropterus gambensis is most closely related to the shelducks but distinct enough to warrant its own subfamily the plectropterinae the goose cyanochen cyanopterus and the cape barren goose cereopsis novaehollandiae have disputed affinities they belong to separate ancient lineages that may ally either to the tadorninae the anserinae or closer to the dabbling ducks anatinae the three species of small waterfowl in the genus nettapus named pygmy geese they seem to represent another ancient lineage with possible affinities to the cape barren goose or the goose the maned goose also known as the maned duck or australian wood duck chenonetta jubata a genus of prehistorically extinct seaducks chendytes is sometimes called the due to their large size the magpie goose anseranas semipalmata is the only living
