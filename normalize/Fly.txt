true flies are insects of the order diptera the name being derived from the greek two and pteron pteron wing insects of this order use only a single pair of wings to fly the hindwings having evolved into advanced mechanosensory organs known as halteres which act as sensors of rotational movement and allow dipterans to perform advanced aerobatics diptera is a large order containing an estimated species including crane flies hoverflies and others although only about species have been describedflies have a mobile head with a pair of large compound eyes and mouthparts designed for piercing and sucking mosquitoes black flies and robber flies or for lapping and sucking in the other groups their wing arrangement gives them great maneuverability in flight and claws and pads on their feet enable them to cling to smooth surfaces flies undergo complete metamorphosis the eggs are laid on the larval and the larvae which lack true limbs develop in a protected environment often inside their food source the pupa is a tough capsule from which the adult emerges when ready to do so flies mostly have short lives as adults diptera is one of the major insect orders and of considerable ecological and human importance flies are important pollinators second only to the bees and their hymenopteran relatives flies may have been among the evolutionarily earliest pollinators responsible for early plant pollination fruit flies are used as model organisms in research but less benignly mosquitoes are vectors for malaria dengue west nile fever yellow fever encephalitis and other infectious diseases and houseflies commensal with humans all over the world spread illnesses flies can be annoyances especially in some parts of the world where they can occur in large numbers buzzing and settling on the skin or eyes to bite or seek fluids larger flies such as tsetse flies and screwworms cause significant economic harm to cattle blowfly larvae known as gentles and other dipteran larvae known more generally as maggots are used as fishing bait and as food for carnivorous animals they are also used in medicine in debridement to clean wounds taxonomy and phylogeny relationships to other insects dipterans are endopterygotes insects that undergo radical metamorphosis they belong to the mecopterida alongside the mecoptera siphonaptera lepidoptera and trichoptera the possession of a single pair of wings distinguishes most true flies from other insects with fly in their names however some true flies such as hippoboscidae louse flies have become secondarily winglessthe cladogram represents the current consensus view relationships between fly subgroups and families the first true dipterans known are from the middle triassic around million years ago and they became widespread during the middle and late triassic modern flowering plants did not appear until the cretaceous around million years ago so the original dipterans must have had a different source of nutrition other than nectar based on the attraction of many modern fly groups to shiny droplets it has been suggested that they may have fed on honeydew produced by bugs which were abundant at the time and dipteran mouthparts are to softening and lapping up the crusted residues the basal clades in the diptera include the deuterophlebiidae and the enigmatic nymphomyiidae three episodes of evolutionary radiation are thought to have occurred based on the fossil record many new species of lower diptera developed in the triassic about million years ago many lower brachycera appeared in the jurassic some million years ago a third radiation took place among the schizophora at the start of the paleogene million years agothe phylogenetic position of diptera has been controversial the monophyly of holometabolous insects has long been accepted with the main orders being established as lepidoptera coleoptera hymenoptera and diptera and it is the relationships between these groups which has caused difficulties diptera is widely thought to be a member of mecopterida along with lepidoptera butterflies and moths trichoptera caddisflies siphonaptera fleas mecoptera scorpionflies and possibly strepsiptera flies diptera has been grouped with siphonaptera and mecoptera in the antliophora but this has not been confirmed by molecular studiesdiptera were traditionally broken down into two suborders nematocera and brachycera distinguished by the differences in antennae the nematocera are identified by their elongated bodies and often feathery antennae as represented by mosquitoes and crane flies the brachycera have rounder bodies and much shorter antennae subsequent studies have identified the nematocera as being with modern phylogenies placing the brachycera within grades of groups formerly placed in the nematocera the construction of a phylogenetic tree has been the subject of ongoing research the following cladogram is based on the flytree project abbreviations used in the cladogram diversity flies are often abundant and are found in almost all terrestrial habitats in the world apart from antarctica they include many familiar insects such as house flies blow flies mosquitoes gnats black flies midges and fruit flies more than have been formally described and the actual species diversity is much greater with the flies from many parts of the world yet to be studied intensively the suborder nematocera include generally small slender insects with long antennae such as mosquitoes gnats midges and while the brachycera includes broader more robust flies with short antennae many nematoceran larvae are aquatic there are estimated to be a total of about species of diptera in europe in the nearctic region in the afrotropical region in the oriental region and in the australasian region while most species have restricted distributions a few like the housefly musca domestica are cosmopolitan gauromydas heros asiloidea with a length of up to cm in is generally considered to be the largest fly in the world while the smallest is euryplatea nanaknihali which at mm in is smaller than a grain of saltbrachycera are ecologically very diverse with many being predatory at the larval stage and some being parasitic animals parasitised include molluscs woodlice millipedes insects mammals and amphibians flies are the second largest group of pollinators after the hymenoptera bees wasps and relatives in wet and colder environments flies are significantly more important as pollinators compared to bees they need less food as they do not need to provision their young many flowers that bear low nectar and those that have evolved trap pollination depend on flies it is thought that some of the earliest pollinators of plants may have been fliesthe greatest diversity of gall forming insects are found among the flies principally in the family cecidomyiidae gall midges many flies most importantly in the family agromyzidae lay their eggs in the mesophyll tissue of leaves with larvae feeding between the surfaces forming blisters and mines some families are mycophagous or fungus feeding these include the cave dwelling mycetophilidae fungus gnats whose larvae are the only diptera with bioluminescence the sciaridae are also fungus feeders some plants are pollinated by fungus feeding flies that visit fungus infected male flowersthe larvae of megaselia scalaris phoridae are almost omnivorous and consume such substances as paint and shoe polish the exorista mella walker fly are considered generalists and parasitoids of a variety of hosts the larvae of the shore flies ephydridae and some chironomidae survive in extreme environments including glaciers diamesa sp chironomidae hot springs geysers saline pools sulphur pools septic tanks and even crude oil helaeomyia petrolei adult hoverflies syrphidae are well known for their mimicry and the larvae adopt diverse lifestyles including being inquiline scavengers inside the nests of social insects some brachycerans are agricultural pests some bite animals and humans and suck their blood and some transmit diseases anatomy and morphology flies are adapted for aerial movement and typically have short and streamlined bodies the first tagma of the fly the head bears the eyes the antennae and the mouthparts the labrum labium mandible and maxilla make up the mouthparts the second tagma the thorax bears the wings and contains the flight muscles on the second segment which is greatly enlarged the first and third segments have been reduced to structures and the third segment bears the halteres which help to balance the insect during flight the third tagma is the abdomen consisting of segments some of which may be fused and with the hindmost segments modified for reproduction some dipterans are mimics and can only be distinguished from their models by very careful inspection an example of this is spilomyia longicornis which is a fly but mimics a vespid wasp flies have a mobile head with a pair of large compound eyes on the sides of the head and in most species three small ocelli on the top the compound eyes may be close together or widely separated and in some instances are divided into a dorsal region and a ventral region perhaps to assist in swarming behaviour the antennae are but variable being feathery or in the different families the mouthparts are adapted for piercing and sucking as in the black flies mosquitoes and robber flies and for lapping and sucking as in many other groups female use mandibles and maxillae to make a incision in the host skin and then lap up the blood that flows the gut includes large diverticulae allowing the insect to store small quantities of liquid after a mealfor visual course control flies optic flow field is analyzed by a set of neurons a subset of these neurons is thought to be involved in using the optic flow to estimate the parameters of such as yaw roll and sideward translation other neurons are thought to be involved in analyzing the content of the visual scene itself such as separating figures from the ground using motion parallax the neuron is responsible for detecting horizontal motion across the entire visual field of the fly allowing the fly to generate and guide stabilizing motor corrections midflight with respect to yaw the ocelli are concerned in the detection of changes in light intensity enabling the fly to react swiftly to the approach of an objectlike other insects flies have chemoreceptors that detect smell and taste and mechanoreceptors that respond to touch the third segments of the antennae and the maxillary palps bear the main olfactory receptors while the gustatory receptors are in the labium pharynx feet wing margins and female genitalia enabling flies to taste their food by walking on it the taste receptors in females at the tip of the abdomen receive information on the suitability of a site for ovipositing flies that feed on blood have special sensory structures that can detect infrared emissions and use them to home in on their hosts and many flies can detect the raised concentration of carbon dioxide that occurs near large animals some tachinid flies ormiinae which are parasitoids of bush crickets have sound receptors to help them locate their singing hosts diptera have one pair of fore wings on the mesothorax and a pair of halteres or reduced hind wings on the metathorax a further adaptation for flight is the reduction in number of the neural ganglia and concentration of nerve tissue in the thorax a feature that is most extreme in the highly derived muscomorpha infraorder some species of flies are exceptional in that they are secondarily flightless the only other order of insects bearing a single pair of true functional wings in addition to any form of halteres are the strepsiptera in contrast to the flies the strepsiptera bear their halteres on the mesothorax and their flight wings on the metathorax each of the fly six legs has a typical insect structure of coxa trochanter femur tibia and tarsus with the tarsus in most instances being subdivided into five tarsomeres at the tip of the limb is a pair of claws and between these are structures known as pulvilli which provide adhesionthe abdomen shows considerable variability among members of the order it consists of eleven segments in primitive groups and ten segments in more derived groups the tenth and eleventh segments having fused the last two or three segments are adapted for reproduction each segment is made up of a dorsal and a ventral sclerite connected by an elastic membrane in some females the sclerites are rolled into a flexible telescopic ovipositor flight flies are capable of great manoeuvrability during flight due to the presence of the halteres these act as gyroscopic organs and are rapidly oscillated in time with the wings they act as a balance and guidance system by providing rapid feedback to the muscles and flies deprived of their halteres are unable to fly the wings and halteres move in synchrony but the amplitude of each wing beat is independent allowing the fly to turn sideways the wings of the fly are attached to two kinds of muscles those used to power it and another set used for fine controlflies tend to fly in a straight line then make a rapid change in direction before continuing on a different straight path the directional changes are called saccades and typically involve an angle of being achieved in milliseconds they are initiated by visual stimuli as the fly observes an object nerves then activate steering muscles in the thorax that cause a small change in wing stroke which generate sufficient torque to turn detecting this within four or five wingbeats the halteres trigger a and the fly heads off in a new directionflies have rapid reflexes that aid their escape from predators but their sustained flight speeds are low dolichopodid flies in the genus condylostylus respond in less than milliseconds to camera flashes by taking flight in the past the deer bot fly cephenemyia was claimed to be one of the fastest insects on the basis of an estimate made visually by charles townsend in this claim of speeds of to miles per hour was regularly repeated until it was shown to be physically impossible as well as incorrect by irving langmuir langmuir suggested an estimated speed of miles per houralthough most flies live and fly close to the ground a few are known to fly at heights and a few like oscinella chloropidae are known to be dispersed by winds at altitudes of up to ft and over long distances some hover flies like metasyrphus corollae have been known to undertake long flights in response to aphid population spurtsmales of fly species such as cuterebra many hover flies bee flies bombyliidae and fruit flies tephritidae maintain territories within which they engage in aerial pursuit to drive away intruding males and other species while these territories may be held by individual males some species such as a freeborni form leks with many males aggregating in displays some flies maintain an airspace and still others form dense swarms that maintain a stationary location with respect to landmarks many flies mate in flight while swarming life cycle and development diptera go through a complete metamorphosis with four distinct life stages egg larva pupa and adult larva in many flies the larval stage is long and adults may have a short life most dipteran larvae develop in protected environments many are aquatic and others are found in moist places such as carrion fruit vegetable matter fungi and in the case of parasitic species inside their hosts they tend to have thin cuticles and become desiccated if exposed to the air apart from the brachycera most dipteran larvae have sclerotinised head capsules which may be reduced to remnant mouth hooks the brachycera however have soft gelatinized head capsules from which the sclerites are reduced or missing many of these larvae retract their heads into their thorax some other anatomical distinction exists between the larvae of the nematocera and the brachycera especially in the brachycera little demarcation is seen between the thorax and abdomen though the demarcation may be visible in many nematocera such as mosquitoes in the brachycera the head of the larva is not clearly distinguishable from the rest of the body and few if any sclerites are present informally such brachyceran larvae are called maggots but the term is not technical and often applied indifferently to fly larvae or insect larvae in general the eyes and antennae of brachyceran larvae are reduced or absent and the abdomen also lacks appendages such as cerci this lack of features is an adaptation to food such as carrion decaying detritus or host tissues surrounding endoparasites nematoceran larvae generally have eyes and antennae while those of brachyceran larvae are reduced or modifieddipteran larvae have no jointed true legs but some dipteran larvae such as species of simuliidae tabanidae and vermileonidae have prolegs adapted to hold onto a substrate in flowing water host tissues or prey the majority of dipterans are oviparous and lay batches of eggs but some species are ovoviviparous where the larvae starting development inside the eggs before they hatch or viviparous the larvae hatching and maturing in the body of the mother before being externally deposited these are found especially in groups that have larvae dependent on food sources that are or are accessible for brief periods this is widespread in some families such as the sarcophagidae in hylemya strigosa anthomyiidae the larva moults to the second instar before hatching and in termitoxenia phoridae females have incubation pouches and a full developed third instar larva is deposited by the adult and it almost immediately pupates with no freely feeding larval stage the tsetse fly as well as other glossinidae hippoboscidae nycteribidae and streblidae exhibits adenotrophic viviparity a single fertilised egg is retained in the oviduct and the developing larva feeds on glandular secretions when fully grown the female finds a spot with soft soil and the larva works its way out of the oviduct buries itself and pupates some flies like lundstroemia parthenogenetica chironomidae reproduce by thelytokous parthenogenesis and some gall midges have larvae that can produce eggs paedogenesis pupa the pupae take various forms in some groups particularly the nematocera the pupa is intermediate between the larval and adult form these pupae are described as obtect having the future appendages visible as structures that adhere to the pupal body the outer surface of the pupa may be leathery and bear spines respiratory features or locomotory paddles in other groups described as coarctate the appendages are not visible in these the outer surface is a puparium formed from the last larval skin and the actual pupa is concealed within when the adult insect is ready to emerge from this tough capsule it inflates a structure on its head and forces its way out adult the adult stage is usually short its function only to mate and lay eggs the genitalia of male flies are rotated to a varying degree from the position found in other insects in some flies this is a temporary rotation during mating but in others it is a permanent torsion of the organs that occurs during the pupal stage this torsion may lead to the anus being below the genitals or in the case of torsion to the sperm duct being wrapped around the gut and the external organs being in their usual position when flies mate the male initially flies on top of the female facing in the same direction but then turns around to face in the opposite direction this forces the male to lie on his back for his genitalia to remain engaged with those of the female or the torsion of the male genitals allows the male to mate while remaining upright this leads to flies having more reproduction abilities than most insects and much quicker flies occur in large populations due to their ability to mate effectively and quickly during the mating season ecology as ubiquitous insects dipterans play an important role at various trophic levels both as consumers and as prey in some groups the larvae complete their development without feeding and in others the adults do not feed the larvae can be herbivores scavengers decomposers predators or parasites with the consumption of decaying organic matter being one of the most prevalent feeding behaviours the fruit or detritus is consumed along with the associated a filter in the pharynx being used to concentrate the particles while larvae have to help shred their food the larvae of some groups feed on or in the living tissues of plants and fungi and some of these are serious pests of agricultural crops some aquatic larvae consume the films of algae that form underwater on rocks and plants many of the parasitoid larvae grow inside and eventually kill other arthropods while parasitic larvae may attack vertebrate hostswhereas many dipteran larvae are aquatic or live in enclosed terrestrial locations the majority of adults live above ground and are capable of flight predominantly they feed on nectar or plant or animal exudates such as honeydew for which their lapping mouthparts are adapted some flies have functional mandibles that may be used for biting the flies that feed on vertebrate blood have sharp stylets that pierce the skin with some species having anticoagulant saliva that is regurgitated before absorbing the blood that flows in this process certain diseases can be transmitted the bot flies oestridae have evolved to parasitize mammals many species complete their life cycle inside the bodies of their hosts the larvae of a few fly groups agromyzidae anthomyiidae cecidomyiidae are capable of inducing plant galls some dipteran larvae are the larvae of many brachyceran families are predaceous in many dipteran groups swarming is a feature of adult life with clouds of insects gathering in certain locations these insects are mostly males and the swarm may serve the purpose of making their location more visible to femalesmost adult diptera have their mouthparts modified to sponge up fluid the adults of many species of flies that feed on liquid food will regurgitate fluid in a behaviour termed as bubbling which has been thought to help the insects evaporate water and concentrate food or possibly to cool by evaporation some adult diptera are known for kleptoparasitism such as members of the sarcophagidae the miltogramminae are known as satellite flies for their habit of following wasps and stealing their stung prey or laying their eggs into them phorids milichids and the genus bengalia are known to steal food carried by ants adaptations flies are eaten by other animals at all stages of their development the eggs and larvae are parasitised by other insects and are eaten by many creatures some of which specialise in feeding on flies but most of which consume them as part of a mixed diet birds bats frogs lizards dragonflies and spiders are among the predators of flies many flies have evolved mimetic resemblances that aid their protection batesian mimicry is widespread with many hoverflies resembling bees and wasps ants and some species of tephritid fruit fly resembling spiders some species of hoverfly are myrmecophilous their young live and grow within the nests of ants they are protected from the ants by imitating chemical odours given by ant colony members bombyliid bee flies such as bombylius major are round furry and distinctly as they visit flowers for nectar and are likely also batesian mimics of beesin contrast drosophila subobscura a species of fly in the genus drosophila lacks a category of hemocytes that are present in other studied species of drosophila leading to an inability to defend against parasitic attacks a form of innate immunodeficiency in culture symbolism flies play a variety of symbolic roles in different cultures these include both positive and negative roles in religion in the traditional navajo religion big fly is an important spirit being in christian demonology beelzebub is a demonic fly the lord of the flies and a god of the philistinesflies have appeared in literature since ancient sumer in a sumerian poem a fly helps the goddess inanna when her husband dumuzid is being chased by galla demons in the mesopotamian versions of the flood myth the dead corpses floating on the waters are compared to flies later the gods are said to swarm like flies around the hero utnapishtim offering flies appear on old babylonian seals as symbols of nergal the god of death lapis lazuli beads were often worn in ancient mesopotamia along with other kinds of prometheus bound which is attributed to the athenian tragic playwright aeschylus a gadfly sent by zeus wife hera pursues and torments his

a fly introducing the general reader to the behaviour and physiology of the flyflies appear in popular culture in concepts such as in film and television production the metaphoric name suggests that events are seen candidly as a fly might see them flies have inspired the design of miniature flying robots steven spielberg film jurassic park relied on the idea that dna could be preserved in the stomach contents of a fly fossilised in amber though the mechanism has been discounted by scientists economic importance dipterans are an important group of insects and have a considerable impact on the environment some flies agromyzidae fruit flies tephritidae and drosophilidae and gall midges cecidomyiidae are pests of agricultural crops others such as tsetse flies screwworm and botflies oestridae attack livestock causing wounds spreading disease and creating significant economic harm see article parasitic flies of domestic animals a few can even cause myiasis in humans still others such as mosquitoes culicidae blackflies simuliidae and drain flies psychodidae impact human health acting as vectors of major tropical diseases among these anopheles mosquitoes transmit malaria filariasis and arboviruses aedes aegypti mosquitoes carry dengue fever and the zika virus blackflies carry river blindness sand flies carry leishmaniasis other dipterans are a nuisance to humans especially when present in large numbers these include houseflies which contaminate food and spread illnesses the biting midges and sandflies ceratopogonidae and the houseflies and stable flies muscidae in tropical regions eye flies chloropidae which visit the eye in search of fluids can be a nuisance in some seasonsmany dipterans serve roles that are useful to humans houseflies blowflies and fungus gnats mycetophilidae are scavengers and aid in decomposition robber flies asilidae tachinids tachinidae and dagger flies and balloon flies empididae are predators and parasitoids of other insects helping to control a variety of pests many dipterans such as bee flies bombyliidae and hoverflies syrphidae are pollinators of crop plants uses drosophila melanogaster a fruit fly has long been used as a model organism in research because of the ease with which it can be bred and reared in the laboratory its small genome and the fact that many of its genes have counterparts in higher eukaryotes a large number of genetic studies have been undertaken based on this species these have had a profound impact on the study of gene expression gene regulatory mechanisms and mutation other studies have investigated physiology microbial pathogenesis and development among other research topics the studies on dipteran relationships by willi hennig helped in the development of cladistics techniques that he applied to morphological characters but now adapted for use with molecular sequences in phylogenetics maggots found on corpses are useful to forensic entomologists maggot species can be identified by their anatomical features and by matching their dna maggots of different species of flies visit corpses and carcases at fairly times after the death of the victim and so do their predators such as beetles in the family histeridae thus the presence or absence of particular species provides evidence for the time since death and sometimes other details such as the place of death when species are confined to particular habitats such as woodland some species of maggots such as blowfly larvae gentles and bluebottle larvae casters are bred commercially they are sold as bait in angling and as food for carnivorous animals kept as pets in zoos or for research such as some mammals fishes reptiles and birds it has been suggested that fly larvae could be used at a large scale as food for farmed chickens pigs and fish however consumers are opposed to the inclusion of insects in their food and the use of insects in animal feed remains illegal in areas such as the european union fly larvae can be used as a biomedical tool for wound care and treatment maggot debridement therapy mdt is the use of blow fly larvae to remove the dead tissue from wounds most commonly being amputations historically this has been used for centuries both intentional and unintentional on battlefields and in early hospital settings removing the dead tissue promotes cell growth and healthy wound healing the larvae also have biochemical properties such as antibacterial activity found in their secretions as they feed these medicinal maggots are a safe and effective treatment for chronic woundsthe sardinian cheese casu marzu is exposed to flies known as cheese skippers such as piophila casei members of the family piophilidae the digestive activities of the fly larvae soften the cheese and modify the aroma as part of the process of maturation at one time european union authorities banned sale of the cheese and it was becoming hard to find but the ban has been lifted on the grounds that the cheese is a traditional local product made by traditional methods notes references further reading blagoderov va lukashevich ed mostovski mb order diptera in rasnitsyn ap and quicke dlj the
