bears are carnivoran mammals of the family ursidae they are classified as caniforms or doglike carnivorans although only eight species of bears are extant they are widespread appearing in a wide variety of habitats throughout the northern hemisphere and partially in the southern hemisphere bears are found on the continents of north america south america europe and asia common characteristics of modern bears include large bodies with stocky legs long snouts small rounded ears shaggy hair plantigrade paws with five nonretractile claws and short tails while the polar bear is mostly carnivorous and the giant panda feeds almost entirely on bamboo the remaining six species are omnivorous with varied diets with the exception of courting individuals and mothers with their young bears are typically solitary animals they may be diurnal or nocturnal and have an excellent sense of smell despite their heavy build and awkward gait they are adept runners climbers and swimmers bears use shelters such as caves and logs as their dens most species occupy their dens during the winter for a long period of hibernation up to days bears have been hunted since prehistoric times for their meat and fur they have been used for and other forms of entertainment such as being made to dance with their powerful physical presence they play a prominent role in the arts mythology and other cultural aspects of various human societies in modern times bears have come under pressure through encroachment on their habitats and illegal trade in bear parts including the asian bile bear market the iucn lists six bear species as vulnerable or endangered and even least concern species such as the brown bear are at risk of extirpation in certain countries the poaching and international trade of these most threatened populations are prohibited but still ongoing etymology the english word bear comes from old english bera and belongs to a family of names for the bear in germanic languages such as swedish bjorn also used as a first name this form is conventionally said to be related to a word for brown so that bear would mean the brown one however ringe notes that while this etymology is semantically plausible a word meaning brown of this form can not be found in he suggests instead that bear is from the word ghwer wild animal this terminology for the animal originated as a taboo avoidance term tribes replaced their original word for this euphemistic expression out of fear that speaking the animal true name might cause it to appear according to author ralph keyes this is the oldest known euphemismbear taxon names such as arctoidea and helarctos come from the ancient greek arktos arktos meaning bear as do the names arctic and antarctic via the name of the constellation ursa major the great bear prominent in the northern skybear taxon names such as ursidae and ursus come from latin the female first name ursula originally derived from a christian saint name means little diminutive of latin ursa in switzerland the male first name urs is especially popular while the name of the canton and city of bern is derived from bar german for bear the germanic name bernard including bernhardt and similar forms means or bold bear the old english name beowulf is a kenning for bear in turn meaning a brave warrior taxonomy the family ursidae is one of nine families in the suborder caniformia or doglike carnivorans within the order carnivora bears closest living relatives are the pinnipeds canids and musteloids modern bears comprise eight species in three subfamilies ailuropodinae monotypic with the giant panda tremarctinae monotypic with the spectacled bear and ursinae containing six species divided into one to three genera depending on the authority nuclear chromosome analysis show that the karyotype of the six ursine bears is nearly identical with each having chromosomes see ursid hybrid whereas the giant panda has chromosomes and the spectacled bear these smaller numbers can be explained by the fusing of some chromosomes and the banding patterns on these match those of the ursine species but differ from those of procyonids which supports the inclusion of these two species in ursidae rather than in procyonidae where they had been placed by some earlier authorities evolution the earliest members of ursidae belong to the extinct subfamily amphicynodontinae including parictis late eocene to early middle miocene mya and the slightly younger allocyon early oligocene mya both from north america these animals looked very different from today bears being small and in overall appearance with diets perhaps more similar to that of a badger parictis does not appear in eurasia and africa until the miocene it is unclear whether ursids were also present in eurasia although faunal exchange across the bering land bridge may have been possible during a major sea level low stand as early as the late eocene about mya and continuing into the early oligocene european genera morphologically very similar to allocyon and to the much younger american kolponomos about mya are known from the oligocene including amphicticeps and amphicynodon there has been various morphological evidence linking amphicynodontines with pinnipeds as both groups were mammals in addition to the support of the clade other morphological and some molecular evidence supports bears being the closet living relatives to pinnipeds the cephalogale is the member of the subfamily hemicyoninae which first appeared during the middle oligocene in eurasia about mya the subfamily includes the younger genera phoberocyon mya and plithocyon mya a species gave rise to the genus ursavus during the early oligocene mya this genus proliferated into many species in asia and is ancestral to all living bears species of ursavus subsequently entered north america together with amphicynodon and cephalogale during the early miocene mya members of the living lineages of bears diverged from ursavus between and mya likely via the species ursavus elmensis based on genetic and morphological data the ailuropodinae pandas were the first to diverge from other living bears about mya although no fossils of this group have been found before about myathe new world bears tremarctinae differentiated from ursinae following a dispersal event into north america during the about mya they invaded south america or ma following formation of the isthmus of panama their earliest fossil representative is plionarctos in north america c ma this genus is probably the direct ancestor to the north american bears genus arctodus the south american bears arctotherium and the spectacled bears tremarctos represented by both an extinct north american species t floridanus and the lone surviving representative of the tremarctinae the south american spectacled bear t ornatus the subfamily ursinae experienced a dramatic proliferation of taxa about mya coincident with major environmental changes the first members of the genus ursus appeared around this time the sloth bear is a modern survivor of one of the earliest lineages to diverge during this radiation event mya it took on its peculiar morphology related to its diet of termites and ants no later than by the early pleistocene by mya the species ursus minimus appears in the fossil record of europe apart from its size it was nearly identical to today asian black bear it is likely ancestral to all bears within ursinae perhaps aside from the sloth bear two lineages evolved from u minimus the black bears including the sun bear the asian black bear and the american black bear and the brown bears which includes the polar bear modern brown bears evolved from u minimus via ursus etruscus which itself is ancestral to the extinct pleistocene cave bear species of ursinae have migrated repeatedly into north america from eurasia as early as mya during the early pliocene the polar bear is the most recently evolved species and descended from a population of brown bears that became isolated in northern latitudes by glaciation years ago phylogeny the bears form a clade within the carnivora the cladogram is based on molecular phylogeny of six genes in flynn note that although they are called bears in some languages red pandas and raccoons and their close relatives are not bears but rather musteloidsthere are two phylogenetic hypotheses on the relationships among extant and fossil bear species one is all species of bears are classified in seven subfamilies as adopted here and related articles amphicynodontinae hemicyoninae ursavinae agriotheriinae ailuropodinae tremarctinae and ursinae below is a cladogram of the subfamilies of bears after mclellan and reiner and qiu et al the second alternative phylogenetic hypothesis was implemented by mckenna et al is to classify all the bear species into the superfamily ursoidea with hemicyoninae and agriotheriinae being classified in the family hemicyonidae amphicynodontinae under this classification were classified as in the superfamily phocoidea in the mckenna and bell classification both bears and pinnipeds in a parvorder of carnivoran mammals known as ursida along with the extinct bear dogs of the family amphicyonidae below is the cladogram based on mckenna and bell classification the phylogeny of extant bear species is shown in a cladogram based on complete mitochondrial dna sequences from yu et al the giant panda followed by the spectacled bear are clearly the oldest species the relationships of the other species are not very well resolved though the polar bear and the brown bear form a close grouping physical characteristics size the bear family includes the most massive extant terrestrial members of the order carnivora the polar bear is considered to be the largest extant species with adult males weighing kilograms pounds and measuring metres ft ft in in total length the smallest species is the sun bear which ranges kg lb in weight and cm in in length prehistoric north and south american bears were the largest species known to have lived the latter estimated to have weighed kg lb and stood m ft in tall body weight varies throughout the year in bears of temperate and arctic climates as they build up fat reserves in the summer and autumn and lose weight during the winter morphology bears are generally bulky and robust animals with short tails they are sexually dimorphic with regard to size with males typically being larger larger species tend to show increased levels of sexual dimorphism in comparison to smaller species relying as they do on strength rather than speed bears have relatively short limbs with thick bones to support their bulk the shoulder blades and the pelvis are correspondingly massive the limbs are much straighter than those of the big cats as there is no need for them to flex in the same way due to the differences in their gait the strong forelimbs are used to catch prey to excavate dens to dig out burrowing animals to turn over rocks and logs to locate prey and to club large creatures unlike most other land carnivorans bears are plantigrade they distribute their weight toward the hind feet which makes them look lumbering when they walk they are capable of bursts of speed but soon tire and as a result mostly rely on ambush rather than the chase bears can stand on their hind feet and sit up straight with remarkable balance their front paws are flexible enough to grasp fruit and leaves bears claws are used for digging climbing tearing and catching prey the claws on the front feet are larger than those on the back and may be a hindrance when climbing trees black bears are the most arboreal of the bears and have the shortest claws pandas are unique in having a bony extension on the wrist of the front feet which acts as a thumb and is used for gripping bamboo shoots as the animals feedmost mammals have agouti hair with each individual hair shaft having bands of color corresponding to two different types of melanin pigment bears however have a single type of melanin and the hairs have a single color throughout their length apart from the tip which is sometimes a different shade the coat consists of long guard hairs which form a protective shaggy covering and short dense hairs which form an insulating layer trapping air close to the skin the shaggy coat helps maintain body heat during winter hibernation and is shed in the spring leaving a shorter summer coat polar bears have hollow translucent guard hairs which gain heat from the sun and conduct it to the skin below they have a thick layer of blubber for extra insulation and the soles of their feet have a dense pad of fur while bears tend to be uniform in color some species may have markings on the chest or face and the giant panda has a bold pelagebears have small rounded ears so as to minimize heat loss but neither their hearing or sight are particularly acute unlike many other carnivorans they have color vision perhaps to help them distinguish ripe nuts and fruits they are unique among carnivorans in not having whiskers on the muzzle however they have an excellent sense of smell better than that of the dog or possibly any other mammal they use smell for signalling to each other either to warn off rivals or detect mates and for finding food smell is the principal sense used by bears to locate most of their food and they have excellent memories which helps them to relocate places where they have found food before the skulls of bears are massive providing anchorage for the powerful masseter and temporal jaw muscles the canine teeth are large but mostly used for display and the molar teeth flat and crushing unlike most other members of the carnivora bears have relatively undeveloped carnassial teeth and their teeth are adapted for a diet that includes a significant amount of vegetable matter considerable variation occurs in dental formula even within a given species this may indicate bears are still in the process of evolving from a mainly diet to a predominantly herbivorous one polar bears appear to have secondarily cheek teeth as their diets have switched back towards carnivory sloth bears lack lower central incisors and use their protusible lips for sucking up the termites on which they feed the general dental formula for living bears is the structure of the larynx of bears appears to be the most basal of the caniforms they possess air pouches connected to the pharynx which may amplify their vocalizationsbears have a fairly simple digestive system typical for carnivorans with a single stomach short undifferentiated intestines and no cecum even the herbivorous giant panda still has the digestive system of a carnivore as well as genes its ability to digest cellulose is ascribed to the microbes in its gut bears must spend much of their time feeding in order to gain enough nutrition from foliage the panda in particular spends hours a day feeding distribution and habitat extant bears are found in sixty countries primarily in the northern hemisphere and are concentrated in asia north america and europe an exception is the spectacled bear native to south america it inhabits the andean region the sun bear range extends below the equator in southeast asia the atlas bear a subspecies of the brown bear was distributed in north africa from morocco to libya but it became extinct around the most widespread species is the brown bear which occurs from western europe eastwards through asia to the western areas of north america the american black bear is restricted to north america and the polar bear is restricted to the arctic sea all the remaining species of bear are asian they occur in a range of habitats which include tropical lowland rainforest both coniferous and broadleaf forests prairies steppes montane grassland alpine scree slopes arctic tundra and in the case of the polar bear ice floes bears may dig their dens in hillsides or use caves hollow logs and dense vegetation for shelter behavior and life history brown and american black bears are generally diurnal meaning that they are active for the most part during the day though they may forage substantially by night other species may be nocturnal active at night though female sloth bears with cubs may feed more at daytime to avoid competition from conspecifics and nocturnal predators bears are overwhelmingly solitary and are considered to be the most asocial of all the carnivora the only times bears are encountered in groups are mothers with young or occasional seasonal bounties of rich food such as salmon runs fights between males can occur and older individuals may have extensive scarring which suggests that maintaining dominance can be intense with their acute sense of smell bears can locate carcasses from several kilometres away they use olfaction to locate other foods encounter mates avoid rivals and recognize their cubs feeding most bears are opportunistic omnivores and consume more plant than animal matter they eat anything from leaves roots and berries to insects carrion fresh meat and fish and have digestive systems and teeth adapted to such a diet at the extremes are the almost entirely herbivorous giant panda and the mostly carnivorous polar bear however all bears feed on any food source that becomes seasonally available for example asiatic black bears in taiwan consume large numbers of acorns when these are most common and switch to ungulates at other times of the yearwhen foraging for plants bears choose to eat them at the stage when they are at their most nutritious and digestible typically avoiding older grasses sedges and leaves hence in more northern temperate areas browsing and grazing is more common early in spring and later becomes more restricted knowing when plants are ripe for eating is a learned behavior berries may be foraged in bushes or at the tops of trees and bears try to maximize the number of berries consumed versus foliage in autumn some bear species forage large amounts of naturally fermented fruits which affects their behavior smaller bears climb trees to obtain mast edible reproductive parts such as acorns such masts can be very important to the diets of these species and mast failures may result in movements by bears looking for alternative food sources brown bears with their powerful digging abilities commonly eat roots the panda diet is over bamboo of different species its strong jaws are adapted for crushing the tough stems of these plants though they prefer to eat the more nutritious leaves bromeliads can make up to of the diet of the spectacled bear which also has strong jaws to bite them open the sloth bear though not as specialized as polar bears and the panda has lost several front teeth usually seen in bears and developed a long suctioning tongue to feed on the ants termites and other burrowing insects they favour at certain times of the year these insects can make up of their diets some species may raid the nests of wasps and bees for the honey and immature insects in spite of stinging from the adults sun bears use their long tongues to lick up both insects and honey fish are an important source of food for some species and brown bears in particular gather in large numbers at salmon runs typically a bear plunges into the water and seizes a fish with its jaws or front paws the preferred parts to eat are the brain and eggs small burrowing mammals like rodents may be dug out and eaten the brown bear and both species of black bears sometimes take large ungulates such as deer and bovids mostly the young and weak these animals may be taken by a short rush and ambush though hiding young may be stiffed out and pounced on the polar bear mainly preys on seals stalking them from the ice or breaking into their dens they primarily eat the highly digestible blubber large mammalian prey is typically killed by a bite to the head or neck or in the case of young simply pinned down and mauled predatory behavior in bears is typically taught to the young by the motherbears are prolific scavengers and kleptoparasites stealing food caches from rodents and carcasses from other predators for hibernating species weight gain is important as it provides nourishment during winter dormancy a brown bear can eat kg lb of food and gain kg lb of fat a day prior to entering its den communication bears produce a number of vocal and sounds grunting or chuffing many be made in cordial situations such as between mothers and cubs or courting couples while moaning huffing snorting or blowing air is made when an individual is stressed barking is produced during times of alarm excitement or to give away the animal position warning sounds include and while bellows growls roars and pulsing sounds are made in aggressive encounters cubs may squeal bawl bleat or scream when in distress and make humming when comfortable or nursing bears sometimes communicate with visual displays such as standing upright which exaggerates the individual size the chest markings of some species may add to this intimidating display staring is an aggressive act and the facial markings of spectacled bears and giant pandas may help draw attention to the eyes during agonistic encounters individuals may approach each other by walking with the head lowered dominance between bears is asserted by making a frontal orientation showing the canine teeth muzzle twisting and neck stretching a subordinate may respond with a lateral orientation by turning away and dropping the head and by sitting or lying downbears may mark territory by rubbing against trees and other objects which may serve to spread their scent this is usually accompanied by clawing and biting the object bark may be spread around to draw attention to the marking post pandas are known to mark objects with urine and a waxy substance from their anal glands polar bears leave behind their scent in their tracks which allow individuals to keep track of one another in the vast arctic wilderness reproduction and development the mating system of bears has variously been described as a form of polygyny promiscuity and serial monogamy during the breeding season males take notice of females in their vicinity and females become more tolerant of males a male bear may visit a female continuously over a period of several days or weeks depending on the species to test her reproductive state during this time period males try to prevent rivals from interacting with their mate courtship may be brief although in some asian species courting pairs may engage in wrestling hugging mock fighting and vocalizing ovulation is induced by mating which can last up to minutes depending on the species gestation typically lasts months including delayed implantation and litter size numbers up to four cubs giant pandas may give birth to twins but they can only suckle one young and the other is left to die in northern living species birth takes place during winter dormancy cubs are born blind and helpless with at most a thin layer of hair relying on their mother for warmth the milk of the female bear is rich in fat and antibodies and cubs may suckle for up to a year after they are born by months cubs can follow their mother outside the den they usually follow her on foot but sloth bear cubs may ride on their mother back male bears play no role in raising young infanticide where an adult male kills the cubs of another has been recorded in polar bears brown bears and american black bears but not in other species males kill young to bring the female into estrus cubs may flee and the mother defends them even at the cost of her lifein some species offspring may become independent around the next spring through some may stay until the female successfully mates again bears reach sexual maturity shortly after they disperse at around years depending on the species male alaskan brown bears and polar bears may continue to grow until they are years old lifespan may also vary between species the brown bear can live an average of years hibernation bears of northern regions including the american black bear and the grizzly bear hibernate in the winter during hibernation the bear metabolism slows down its body temperature decreases slightly and its heart rate slows from a normal value of to just beats per minute bears normally do not wake during their hibernation and can go the entire period without eating drinking urinating or defecating a fecal plug is formed in the colon and is expelled when the bear wakes in the spring if they have stored enough body fat their muscles remain in good condition and their protein maintenance requirements are met from recycling waste urea female bears give birth during the hibernation period and are roused when doing so mortality bears do not have many predators the most important are humans and as they started cultivating crops they increasingly came in conflict with the bears that raided them since the invention of firearms people have been able to kill bears with greater ease felids like the tiger may also prey on bears particularly cubs which may also be threatened by canidsbears are parasitized by eighty species of parasites including protozoans and worms and nematodes and flukes in their heart liver lungs and bloodstream externally they have ticks fleas and lice a study of american black bears found seventeen species of endoparasite including the protozoan sarcocystis the parasitic worm diphyllobothrium mansonoides and the nematodes dirofilaria immitis capillaria aerophila physaloptera sp strongyloides sp and others of these d mansonoides and adult c aerophila were causing pathological symptoms by contrast polar bears have few parasites many parasitic species need a secondary usually terrestrial host and the polar bear life style is such that few alternative hosts exist in their environment the protozoan toxoplasma gondii has been found in polar bears and the nematode trichinella nativa can cause a serious infection and decline in older polar bears bears in north america are sometimes infected by a morbillivirus similar to the canine distemper virus they are susceptible to infectious canine hepatitis with black bears dying rapidly of encephalitis and hepatitis relationship with humans conservation in modern times bears have come under pressure through encroachment on their habitats and illegal trade in bear parts including the asian bile bear market though hunting is now banned largely replaced by farming the iucn lists six bear species as vulnerable even the two least concern species the brown bear and the american black bear are at risk of extirpation in certain areas in general these two species inhabit remote areas with little interaction with humans and the main causes of mortality are hunting trapping and depredationlaws have been passed in many areas of the world to protect bears from habitat destruction public perception of bears is often positive as people identify with bears due to their omnivorous diets their ability to stand on two legs and their symbolic importance support for bear protection is widespread at least in more affluent societies the giant panda has become a worldwide symbol of conservation the sichuan giant panda sanctuaries which are home to around of the wild panda population gained a unesco world heritage site designation in where bears raid crops or attack livestock they may come into conflict with humans in poorer rural regions attitudes may be more shaped by the dangers posed by bears and the economic costs they cause to farmers and ranchers attacks several bear species are dangerous to humans especially in areas where they have become used to people elsewhere they generally avoid humans injuries caused by bears are rare but are widely reported bears may attack humans in response to being startled in defense of young or food or even for predatory reasons entertainment hunting food and folk medicine bears in captivity have for centuries been used for entertainment they have been trained to dance and were kept for baiting in europe at least since the century there were five gardens in southwark london at that time archaeological remains of three of these have survived across europe nomadic romani bear handlers called ursari lived by busking with their bears from the century bears have been hunted for sport food and folk medicine their meat is dark and stringy like a tough cut of beef in cantonese cuisine bear paws are considered a delicacy bear meat should be cooked thoroughly as it can be infected with the parasite trichinella spiralisthe peoples of eastern asia use bears body parts and secretions notably their gallbladders and bile as part of traditional chinese medicine more than bears are thought to be kept on farms in china vietnam and south korea for the production of bile trade in bear products is prohibited under cites but bear bile has been detected in shampoos wine and herbal medicines sold in canada the united states and australia literature art and symbolism there is evidence of prehistoric bear worship though this is disputed by archaeologists it is possible that bear worship existed in early chinese and ainu cultures the prehistoric finns siberian peoples and more recently koreans considered the bear as the spirit of their forefathers in many native american cultures the bear is a symbol of rebirth because of its hibernation and the image of the mother bear was prevalent throughout societies in north america and eurasia based on the female devotion and protection of her cubs japanese folklore features the onikuma a demon bear that walks upright the ainu of northern japan a different people from the japanese saw the bear instead as sacred hirasawa byozan painted a scene in documentary style of a bear sacrifice in an ainu temple complete with offerings to the dead animal spiritin korean mythology a tiger and a bear prayed to hwanung the son of the lord of heaven that they might become human upon hearing their prayers hwanung gave them cloves of garlic and a bundle of mugwort ordering them to eat only this sacred food and remain out of the sunlight for days the tiger gave up after about twenty days and left the cave however the bear persevered and was transformed into a woman the bear and the tiger are said to represent two tribes that sought the favor of the heavenly prince the ungnyeo was grateful and made offerings to hwanung however she lacked a husband and soon became sad and prayed beneath a divine birch tree korean sindansu hanja Shen Tan Shu  rr shindansu to be blessed with a child hwanung moved by her prayers took her for his wife and soon she gave birth to a son named dangun wanggeom who was the legendary founder of gojoseon the first ever korean kingdom artio dea artio in the religion was a celtic bear goddess evidence of her worship has notably been found at bern itself named for the bear her name is derived from the celtic word for bear artos in ancient greece archaic cult of artemis in bear form survived into classical times at brauron where young athenian girls passed an initiation right as arktai she bears for artemis and one of her nymphs as a see the myth of callisto the constellations of ursa major and ursa minor the great and little bears are named for their supposed resemblance to bears from the time of ptolemy the nearby star arcturus means guardian of the bear as if it were watching the two constellations ursa major has been associated with a bear for as much as years since paleolithic times in the widespread cosmic hunt myths these are found on both sides of the bering land bridge which was lost to the sea some years agoin madrid spain the east side of the puerta del sol has the statue of the bear and the strawberry tree the statue is created by sculptor antonio navarro santafe and inaugurated on january it presents a bear supports his paws on the strawberry tree and directs his attention towards one of the fruits a form the coat of arms of madrid pliny the elder natural history century ad claims that when first born bears are shapeless masses of white flesh a little larger than mice their claws alone being prominent the mother then licks them gradually into proper shape this belief was echoed by authors of bestiaries throughout the medieval period bears are mentioned in the bible the second book of kings relates the story of the prophet elisha calling on them to eat the youths who taunted him legends of saints taming bears are common in the alpine zone in the arms of the bishopric of freising the bear is the dangerous totem animal tamed by st corbinian and made to carry his civilized baggage over the mountains bears similarly feature in the legends of st romedius saint gall and saint columbanus this recurrent motif was used by the church as a symbol of the victory of christianity over paganism in the norse settlements of northern england during the century a type of hogback grave cover of a long narrow block of stone with a shaped apex like the roof beam of a long house is carved with a muzzled thus christianized bear clasping each gable end as in the church at brompton north yorkshire and across the british isles lacplesis meaning is a latvian legendary hero who is said to have killed a bear by ripping its jaws apart with his bare hands however as
