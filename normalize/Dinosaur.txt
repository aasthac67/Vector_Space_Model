dinosaurs are a diverse group of reptiles of the clade dinosauria they first appeared during the triassic period between and million years ago although the exact origin and timing of the evolution of dinosaurs is the subject of active research they became the dominant terrestrial vertebrates after the extinction event million years ago their dominance continued throughout the jurassic and cretaceous periods the fossil record demonstrates that birds are modern feathered dinosaurs having evolved from earlier theropods during the late jurassic epoch as such birds were the only dinosaur lineage to survive the extinction event approximately million years ago dinosaurs can therefore be divided into avian dinosaurs or birds and dinosaurs which are all dinosaurs other than birds dinosaurs are a varied group of animals from taxonomic morphological and ecological standpoints birds at over living species are the most diverse group of vertebrates besides perciform fish using fossil evidence paleontologists have identified over distinct genera and more than different species of dinosaurs dinosaurs are represented on every continent by both extant species birds and fossil remains through the first half of the century before birds were recognized to be dinosaurs most of the scientific community believed dinosaurs to have been sluggish and most research conducted since the however has indicated that all dinosaurs were active animals with elevated metabolisms and numerous adaptations for social interaction some were herbivorous others carnivorous evidence suggests that all dinosaurs were and that was a trait shared by many dinosaurs both avian and while dinosaurs were ancestrally bipedal many extinct groups included quadrupedal species and some were able to shift between these stances elaborate display structures such as horns or crests are common to all dinosaur groups and some extinct groups developed skeletal modifications such as bony armor and spines while the dinosaurs surviving avian lineage birds are generally small due to the constraints of flight many prehistoric dinosaurs and avian were largest sauropod dinosaurs are estimated to have reached lengths of meters feet and heights of m ft and were the largest land animals of all time still the idea that dinosaurs were uniformly gigantic is a misconception based in part on preservation bias as large sturdy bones are more likely to last until they are fossilized many dinosaurs were quite small xixianykus for example was only about centimeters inches long since the first dinosaur fossils were recognized in the early century mounted fossil dinosaur skeletons have been major attractions at museums around the world and dinosaurs have become an enduring part of world culture the large sizes of some dinosaur groups as well as their seemingly monstrous and fantastic nature have ensured dinosaurs regular appearance in books and films such as jurassic park persistent public enthusiasm for the animals has resulted in significant funding for dinosaur science and new discoveries are regularly covered by the media etymology the taxon was formally named in by paleontologist sir richard owen who used it to refer to the distinct tribe or of saurian reptiles that were then being recognized in england and around the world the term is derived from ancient greek deinos deinos meaning potent or fearfully great and sauros sauros meaning or reptile though the taxonomic name has often been interpreted as a reference to dinosaurs teeth claws and other fearsome characteristics owen intended it merely to evoke their size and majestyother prehistoric animals including pterosaurs mosasaurs ichthyosaurs plesiosaurs and dimetrodon while often popularly conceived of as dinosaurs are not taxonomically classified as dinosaurs pterosaurs are distantly related to dinosaurs being members of the clade ornithodira the other groups mentioned are like dinosaurs and pterosaurs members of sauropsida the reptile and bird clade except dimetrodon which is a synapsid definition under phylogenetic nomenclature dinosaurs are usually defined as the group consisting of the most recent common ancestor mrca of triceratops and modern birds neornithes and all its descendants it has also been suggested that dinosauria be defined with respect to the mrca of megalosaurus and iguanodon because these were two of the three genera cited by richard owen when he recognized the dinosauria both definitions result in the same set of animals being defined as dinosaurs dinosauria ornithischia saurischia encompassing ankylosaurians armored herbivorous quadrupeds stegosaurians plated herbivorous quadrupeds ceratopsians herbivorous quadrupeds with horns and frills ornithopods bipedal or quadrupedal herbivores including theropods mostly bipedal carnivores and birds and sauropodomorphs mostly large herbivorous quadrupeds with long necks and tails birds are now recognized as being the sole surviving lineage of theropod dinosaurs in traditional taxonomy birds were considered a separate class that had evolved from dinosaurs a distinct superorder however a majority of contemporary paleontologists concerned with dinosaurs reject the traditional style of classification in favor of phylogenetic taxonomy this approach requires that for a group to be natural all descendants of members of the group must be included in the group as well birds are thus considered to be dinosaurs and dinosaurs are therefore not extinct birds are classified as belonging to the subgroup maniraptora which are coelurosaurs which are theropods which are saurischians which are dinosaursresearch by matthew g baron david b norman and paul m barrett in suggested a radical revision of dinosaurian systematics phylogenetic analysis by baron et al recovered the ornithischia as being closer to the theropoda than the sauropodomorpha as opposed to the traditional union of theropods with sauropodomorphs they resurrected the clade ornithoscelida to refer to the group containing ornithischia and theropoda dinosauria itself was as the last common ancestor of triceratops horridus passer domesticus and diplodocus carnegii and all of its descendants to ensure that sauropods and kin remain included as dinosaurs general description using one of the above definitions dinosaurs can be generally described as archosaurs with hind limbs held erect beneath the body many prehistoric animal groups are popularly conceived of as dinosaurs such as ichthyosaurs mosasaurs plesiosaurs pterosaurs and pelycosaurs especially dimetrodon but are not classified scientifically as dinosaurs and none had the erect hind limb posture characteristic of true dinosaurs dinosaurs were the dominant terrestrial vertebrates of the mesozoic era especially the jurassic and cretaceous periods other groups of animals were restricted in size and niches mammals for example rarely exceeded the size of a domestic cat and were generally carnivores of small preydinosaurs have always been an extremely varied group of animals according to a study over dinosaur genera have been identified with certainty so far and the total number of genera preserved in the fossil record has been estimated at around nearly of which remain to be discovered an earlier study predicted that about dinosaur genera existed including many that would not have been preserved in the fossil record by september different species of dinosaurs had been namedin the estimated number of dinosaur species that existed in the mesozoic was estimated to be some are herbivorous others carnivorous including insectivores and omnivores while dinosaurs were ancestrally bipedal as are all modern birds some prehistoric species were quadrupeds and others such as anchisaurus and iguanodon could walk just as easily on two or four legs cranial modifications like horns and crests are common dinosaurian traits and some extinct species had bony armor although known for large size many mesozoic dinosaurs were or smaller and modern birds are generally small in size dinosaurs today inhabit every continent and fossils show that they had achieved global distribution by at least the early jurassic epoch modern birds inhabit most available habitats from terrestrial to marine and there is evidence that some dinosaurs such as microraptor could fly or at least glide and others such as spinosaurids had semiaquatic habits distinguishing anatomical features while recent discoveries have made it more difficult to present a universally list of dinosaurs distinguishing features nearly all dinosaurs discovered so far share certain modifications to the ancestral archosaurian skeleton or are clear descendants of older dinosaurs showing these modifications although some later groups of dinosaurs featured further modified versions of these traits they are considered typical for dinosauria the earliest dinosaurs had them and passed them on to their descendants such modifications originating in the most recent common ancestor of a certain taxonomic group are called the synapomorphies of such a groupa detailed assessment of archosaur interrelations by sterling nesbitt confirmed or found the following twelve unambiguous synapomorphies some previously known in the skull a supratemporal fossa excavation is present in front of the supratemporal fenestra the main opening in the rear skull roof epipophyses obliquely processes on the rear top corners present in the anterior front neck vertebrae behind the atlas and axis the first two neck vertebrae apex of a deltopectoral crest a projection on which the deltopectoral muscles attach located at or more than down the length of the humerus upper arm bone radius a lower arm bone shorter than of humerus length fourth trochanter projection where the caudofemoralis muscle attaches on the inner rear shaft on the femur thigh bone is a sharp flange fourth trochanter asymmetrical with distal lower margin forming a steeper angle to the shaft on the astragalus and calcaneum upper ankle bones the proximal articular facet the top connecting surface for the fibula occupies less than of the transverse width of the element exoccipitals bones at the back of the skull do not meet along the midline on the floor of the endocranial cavity the inner space of the braincase in the pelvis the proximal articular surfaces of the ischium with the ilium and the pubis are separated by a large concave surface on the upper side of the ischium a part of the open hip joint is located between the contacts with the pubic bone and the ilium cnemial crest on the tibia protruding part of the top surface of the shinbone arcs anterolaterally curves to the front and the outer side distinct proximodistally oriented vertical ridge present on the posterior face of the distal end of the tibia the rear surface of the lower end of the shinbone concave articular surface for the fibula of the calcaneum the top surface of the calcaneum where it touches the fibula has a hollow profile nesbitt found a number of further potential synapomorphies and discounted a number of synapomorphies previously suggested some of these are also present in silesaurids which nesbitt recovered as a sister group to dinosauria including a large anterior trochanter metatarsals ii and iv of subequal length reduced contact between ischium and pubis the presence of a cnemial crest on the tibia and of an ascending process on the astragalus and many others a variety of other skeletal features are shared by dinosaurs however because they are either common to other groups of archosaurs or were not present in all early dinosaurs these features are not considered to be synapomorphies for example as diapsids dinosaurs ancestrally had two pairs of infratemporal fenestrae openings in the skull behind the eyes and as members of the diapsid group archosauria had additional openings in the snout and lower jaw additionally several characteristics once thought to be synapomorphies are now known to have appeared before dinosaurs or were absent in the earliest dinosaurs and independently evolved by different dinosaur groups these include an elongated scapula or shoulder blade a sacrum composed of three or more fused vertebrae three are found in some other archosaurs but only two are found in herrerasaurus and a perforate acetabulum or hip socket with a hole at the center of its inside surface closed in saturnalia tupiniquim for example another difficulty of determining distinctly dinosaurian features is that early dinosaurs and other archosaurs from the late triassic epoch are often poorly known and were similar in many ways these animals have sometimes been misidentified in the literature dinosaurs stand with their hind limbs erect in a manner similar to most modern mammals but distinct from most other reptiles whose limbs sprawl out to either side this posture is due to the development of a laterally facing recess in the pelvis usually an open socket and a corresponding inwardly facing distinct head on the femur their erect posture enabled early dinosaurs to breathe easily while moving which likely permitted stamina and activity levels that surpassed those of sprawling reptiles erect limbs probably also helped support the evolution of large size by reducing bending stresses on limbs some archosaurs including rauisuchians also had erect limbs but achieved this by a configuration of the hip joint where instead of having a projection from the femur insert on a socket on the hip the upper pelvic bone was rotated to form an overhanging shelf evolutionary history origins and early evolution dinosaurs diverged from their archosaur ancestors during the middle to late triassic epochs roughly million years after the devastating extinction event wiped out an estimated of all marine species and of terrestrial vertebrate species approximately million years ago radiometric dating of the rock formation that contained fossils from the early dinosaur genus eoraptor at million years old establishes its presence in the fossil record at this time paleontologists think that eoraptor resembles the common ancestor of all dinosaurs if this is true its traits suggest that the first dinosaurs were small bipedal predators the discovery of primitive ornithodirans such as marasuchus and lagerpeton in argentinian middle triassic strata supports this view analysis of recovered fossils suggests that these animals were indeed small bipedal predators dinosaurs may have appeared as early as million years ago as evidenced by remains of the genus nyasasaurus from that period though known fossils of these animals are too fragmentary to tell if they are dinosaurs or very close dinosaurian relatives paleontologist max c langer et al determined that staurikosaurus from the santa maria formation dates to million years ago making it older in geologic age than eoraptorwhen dinosaurs appeared they were not the dominant terrestrial animals the terrestrial habitats were occupied by various types of archosauromorphs and therapsids like cynodonts and rhynchosaurs their main competitors were the pseudosuchia such as aetosaurs ornithosuchids and rauisuchians which were more successful than the dinosaurs most of these other animals became extinct in the triassic in one of two events first at about million years ago a variety of basal archosauromorphs including the protorosaurs became extinct this was followed by the extinction event about million years ago that saw the end of most of the other groups of early archosaurs like aetosaurs ornithosuchids phytosaurs and rauisuchians rhynchosaurs and dicynodonts survived at least in some areas at least as late as norian and late norian or earliest rhaetian stages respectively and the exact date of their extinction is uncertain these losses left behind a land fauna of crocodylomorphs dinosaurs mammals pterosaurians and turtles the first few lines of early dinosaurs diversified through the carnian and norian stages of the triassic possibly by occupying the niches of the groups that became extinct also notably there was a heightened rate of extinction during the carnian pluvial event evolution and paleobiogeography dinosaur evolution after the triassic follows changes in vegetation and the location of continents in the late triassic and early jurassic the continents were connected as the single landmass pangaea and there were a worldwide dinosaur fauna mostly composed of coelophysoid carnivores and early sauropodomorph herbivores gymnosperm plants particularly conifers a potential food source radiated in the late triassic early sauropodomorphs did not have sophisticated mechanisms for processing food in the mouth and so must have employed other means of breaking down food farther along the digestive tract the general homogeneity of dinosaurian faunas continued into the middle and late jurassic where most localities had predators consisting of ceratosaurians spinosauroids and carnosaurians and herbivores consisting of stegosaurian ornithischians and large sauropods examples of this include the morrison formation of north america and tendaguru beds of tanzania dinosaurs in china show some differences with specialized sinraptorid theropods and unusual sauropods like mamenchisaurus ankylosaurians and ornithopods were also becoming more common but prosauropods had become extinct conifers and pteridophytes were the most common plants sauropods like the earlier prosauropods were not oral processors but ornithischians were evolving various means of dealing with food in the mouth including potential organs to keep food in the mouth and jaw motions to grind food another notable evolutionary event of the jurassic was the appearance of true birds descended from maniraptoran coelurosaurians by the early cretaceous and the ongoing breakup of pangaea dinosaurs were becoming strongly differentiated by landmass the earliest part of this time saw the spread of ankylosaurians iguanodontians and brachiosaurids through europe north america and northern africa these were later supplemented or replaced in africa by large spinosaurid and carcharodontosaurid theropods and rebbachisaurid and titanosaurian sauropods also found in south america in asia maniraptoran coelurosaurians like dromaeosaurids troodontids and oviraptorosaurians became the common theropods and ankylosaurids and early ceratopsians like psittacosaurus became important herbivores meanwhile australia was home to a fauna of basal ankylosaurians hypsilophodonts and iguanodontians the stegosaurians appear to have gone extinct at some point in the late early cretaceous or early late cretaceous a major change in the early cretaceous which would be amplified in the late cretaceous was the evolution of flowering plants at the same time several groups of dinosaurian herbivores evolved more sophisticated ways to orally process food ceratopsians developed a method of slicing with teeth stacked on each other in batteries and iguanodontians refined a method of grinding with dental batteries taken to its extreme in hadrosaurids some sauropods also evolved tooth batteries best exemplified by the rebbachisaurid nigersaurus there were three general dinosaur faunas in the late cretaceous in the northern continents of north america and asia the major theropods were tyrannosaurids and various types of smaller maniraptoran theropods with a predominantly ornithischian herbivore assemblage of hadrosaurids ceratopsians ankylosaurids and pachycephalosaurians in the southern continents that had made up the gondwana abelisaurids were the common theropods and titanosaurian sauropods the common herbivores finally in europe dromaeosaurids rhabdodontid iguanodontians nodosaurid ankylosaurians and titanosaurian sauropods were prevalent flowering plants were greatly radiating with the first grasses appearing by the end of the cretaceous grinding hadrosaurids and shearing ceratopsians became extremely diverse across north america and asia theropods were also radiating as herbivores or omnivores with therizinosaurians and ornithomimosaurians becoming commonthe extinction event which occurred approximately million years ago at the end of the cretaceous caused the extinction of all dinosaur groups except for the neornithine birds some other diapsid groups such as crocodilians sebecosuchians turtles lizards snakes sphenodontians and choristoderans also survived the eventthe surviving lineages of neornithine birds including the ancestors of modern ratites ducks and chickens and a variety of waterbirds diversified rapidly at the beginning of the paleogene period entering ecological niches left vacant by the extinction of mesozoic dinosaur groups such as the arboreal enantiornithines aquatic hesperornithines and even the larger terrestrial theropods in the form of gastornis eogruiids bathornithids ratites geranoidids mihirungs and terror birds it is often cited that mammals the neornithines for dominance of most terrestrial niches but many of these groups with rich mammalian faunas for most of the cenozoic era terror birds and bathornithids occupied carnivorous guilds alongside predatory mammals and ratites are still fairly successful as herbivores eogruiids similarly lasted from the eocene to pliocene only becoming extinct very recently after over million years of with many mammal groups classification dinosaurs belong to a group known as archosaurs which also includes modern crocodilians within the archosaur group dinosaurs are differentiated most noticeably by their gait dinosaur legs extend directly beneath the body whereas the legs of lizards and crocodilians sprawl out to either sidecollectively dinosaurs as a clade are divided into two primary branches saurischia and ornithischia saurischia includes those taxa sharing a more recent common ancestor with birds than with ornithischia while ornithischia includes all taxa sharing a more recent common ancestor with triceratops than with saurischia anatomically these two groups can be distinguished most noticeably by their pelvic structure early from the greek sauros sauros meaning lizard and ischion iskhion meaning hip joint the hip structure of their ancestors with a pubis bone directed cranially or forward this basic form was modified by rotating the pubis backward to varying degrees in several groups herrerasaurus therizinosauroids dromaeosaurids and birds saurischia includes the theropods exclusively bipedal and with a wide variety of diets and sauropodomorphs herbivores which include advanced quadrupedal groups by contrast from the greek ornitheios ornitheios meaning of a bird and ischion iskhion meaning hip joint a pelvis that superficially resembled a bird pelvis the pubic bone was oriented caudally unlike birds the ornithischian pubis also usually had an additional process ornithischia includes a variety of species that were primarily herbivores nb the terms lizard hip and bird hip are misnomers birds evolved from dinosaurs with lizard hips taxonomy the following is a simplified classification of dinosaur groups based on their evolutionary relationships and organized based on the list of mesozoic dinosaur species provided by holtz a more detailed version can be found at dinosaur classification the dagger is used to signify groups with no living members dinosauriasaurischia includes theropoda and sauropodomorpha early bipedal carnivores theropoda all bipedal most were carnivorous small early theropods includes coelophysis and close relatives early crested and carnivorous theropods generally elaborately horned the dominant southern carnivores of the cretaceous tetanurae stiff tails includes most theropods early group of large carnivores including the semiaquatic spinosaurids allosaurus and close relatives like carcharodontosaurus coelurosauria feathered theropods with a range of body sizes and niches common early coelurosaurs with reduced forelimbs tyrannosaurus and close relatives had reduced forelimbs mostly toothless carnivores to possible herbivores small insectivores with reduced forelimbs each bearing one enlarged claw maniraptora hand snatchers had long slender arms and fingers bipedal herbivores with large hand claws and small heads mostly toothless their diet and lifestyle are uncertain small winged theropods or primitive birds to with a distinctive toe claw avialae modern birds and extinct relatives small primitive avialans with long third fingers large early avialans small toothless avialans primitive flying avialans euornithes advanced flying birds toothed cretaceous chinese birds specialized aquatic diving birds aves modern beaked birds and their extinct relatives herbivores with small heads long necks long tails small primitive omnivorous sauropodomorphs primitive strictly bipedal prosauropods small primitive sauropodomorphs small primitive sauropodomorphs very large and heavy usually over m ft long quadrupedal primitive sauropods with limbs true sauropods whale reptiles european group of jurassic and cretaceous sauropods new sauropods skulls and tails elongated teeth typically narrow and boxy skulls or teeth macronarians diverse stocky with wide hips most common in the late cretaceous of southern continents diverse bipedal and quadrupedal herbivores small basal ornithopod with prominent teeth armored dinosaurs mostly quadrupeds scutes as primary armor some had tails spikes and plates as primary armor new ornithischians various sizes bipeds and quadrupeds evolved a method of chewing using skull flexibility and numerous teeth characterized by a cranial growth bipeds with domed or knobby growth on skulls quadrupeds with frills many also had horns biology knowledge about dinosaurs is derived from a variety of fossil and records including fossilized bones feces trackways gastroliths feathers impressions of skin internal organs and soft tissues many fields of study contribute to our understanding of dinosaurs including physics especially biomechanics chemistry biology and the earth sciences of which paleontology is a two topics of particular interest and study have been dinosaur size and behavior size current evidence suggests that dinosaur average size varied through the triassic early jurassic late jurassic and cretaceous predatory theropod dinosaurs which occupied most terrestrial carnivore niches during the mesozoic most often fall into the to kg to lb category when sorted by estimated weight into categories based on order of magnitude whereas recent predatory carnivoran mammals peak in the to kg to lb category the mode of mesozoic dinosaur body masses is between to metric tons to short tons this contrasts sharply with the average size of cenozoic mammals estimated by the national museum of natural history as about to kg to lb the sauropods were the largest and heaviest dinosaurs for much of the dinosaur era the smallest sauropods were larger than anything else in their habitat and the largest was an order of magnitude more massive than anything else that has since walked the earth giant prehistoric mammals such as paraceratherium the largest land mammal ever were dwarfed by the giant sauropods and only modern whales approach or surpass them in size there are several proposed advantages for the large size of sauropods including protection from predation reduction of energy use and longevity but it may be that the most important advantage was dietary large animals are more efficient at digestion than small animals because food spends more time in their digestive systems this also permits them to subsist on food with lower nutritive value than smaller animals sauropod remains are mostly found in rock formations interpreted as dry or seasonally dry and the ability to eat large quantities of browse would have been advantageous in such environments largest and smallest scientists will probably never be certain of the largest and smallest dinosaurs to have ever existed this is because only a tiny percentage of animals were ever fossilized and most of these remain buried in the earth few of the specimens that are recovered are complete skeletons and impressions of skin and other soft tissues are rare rebuilding a complete skeleton by comparing the size and morphology of bones to those of similar species is an inexact art and reconstructing the muscles and other organs of the living animal is at best a process of educated guessworkthe tallest and heaviest dinosaur known from good skeletons is giraffatitan brancai previously classified as a species of brachiosaurus its remains were discovered in tanzania between and bones from several individuals were incorporated into the skeleton now mounted and on display at the museum fur naturkunde in berlin this mount is meters ft tall and to meters to ft long and would have belonged to an animal that weighed between and kilograms and lb the longest complete dinosaur is the meters ft long diplodocus which was discovered in wyoming in the united states and displayed in pittsburgh carnegie museum of natural history in the longest dinosaur known from good fossil material is the patagotitan the skeleton mount in the american museum of natural history in new york is meters ft long the museo municipal carmen funes in plaza huincul argentina has an argentinosaurus reconstructed skeleton mount meters ft long there were larger dinosaurs but knowledge of them is based entirely on a small number of fragmentary fossils most of the largest herbivorous specimens on record were discovered in the or later and include the massive argentinosaurus which may have weighed to kilograms to short tons and reached length of to meters to ft some of the longest were the meters ft long diplodocus hallorum formerly seismosaurus the to meters to ft long supersaurus and meters ft long patagotitan and the tallest the meters ft tall sauroposeidon which could have reached a window the heaviest and longest dinosaur may have been maraapunisaurus known only from a now lost partial vertebral neural arch described in extrapolating from the illustration of this bone the animal may have been meters ft long and weighed kg lb however as no further evidence of sauropods of this size has been found and the discoverer edward drinker cope had made typographic errors before it is likely to have been an extreme overestimationthe largest carnivorous dinosaur was spinosaurus reaching a length of to meters to ft and weighing to metric tons to short tons other large carnivorous theropods included giganotosaurus carcharodontosaurus and tyrannosaurus therizinosaurus and deinocheirus were among the tallest of the theropods the largest ornithischian dinosaur was probably the hadrosaurid shantungosaurus giganteus which measured meters ft the largest individuals may have weighed as much as metric tons short tons the smallest dinosaur known is the bee hummingbird with a length of only centimeters in and mass of around g oz the smallest known dinosaurs were about the size of pigeons and were those theropods most closely related to birds for example anchiornis huxleyi is currently the smallest dinosaur described from an adult specimen with an estimated weight of g oz and a total skeletal length of centimeters ft the smallest herbivorous dinosaurs included microceratus and wannanosaurus at about centimeters ft long each behavior many modern birds are highly social often found living in flocks there is general agreement that some behaviors that are common in birds as well as in crocodiles birds closest living relatives were also common among extinct dinosaur groups interpretations of behavior in fossil species are generally based on the pose of skeletons and their habitat computer simulations of their biomechanics and comparisons with modern animals in similar ecological nichesthe first potential evidence for herding or flocking as a widespread behavior common to many dinosaur groups in addition to birds was the discovery of iguanodon bernissartensis ornithischians that were then thought to have perished together in bernissart belgium after they fell into a deep flooded sinkhole and drowned other sites have been discovered subsequently those along with multiple trackways suggest that gregarious behavior was common in many early dinosaur species trackways of hundreds or even thousands of herbivores indicate that hadrosaurids may have moved in great herds like the american bison or the african springbok sauropod tracks document that these animals traveled in groups composed of several different species at least in oxfordshire england although there is no evidence for specific herd structures congregating into herds may have evolved for defense for migratory purposes or to provide protection for young there is evidence that many types of dinosaurs including various theropods sauropods ankylosaurians ornithopods and ceratopsians formed aggregations of immature individuals one example is a site in inner mongolia that has yielded the remains of over sinornithomimus from one to seven years old this assemblage is interpreted as a social group that was trapped in mud the interpretation of dinosaurs as gregarious has also extended to depicting carnivorous theropods as pack hunters working together to bring down large prey however this lifestyle is uncommon among modern birds crocodiles and other reptiles and the taphonomic evidence suggesting pack hunting in such theropods as deinonychus and allosaurus can also be interpreted as the results of fatal disputes between feeding animals as is seen in many modern diapsid predators the crests and frills of some dinosaurs like the marginocephalians theropods and lambeosaurines may have been too fragile to be used for active defense and so they were likely used for sexual or aggressive displays though little is known about dinosaur mating and territorialism head wounds from bites suggest that theropods at least engaged in active aggressive confrontationsfrom a behavioral standpoint one of the most valuable dinosaur fossils was discovered in the gobi desert in it included a velociraptor attacking a protoceratops providing evidence that dinosaurs did indeed attack each other additional evidence for attacking live prey is the partially healed tail of an edmontosaurus a hadrosaurid dinosaur the tail is damaged in such a way that shows the animal was bitten by a tyrannosaur but survived cannibalism amongst some species of dinosaurs was confirmed by tooth marks found in madagascar in involving the theropod majungasauruscomparisons between the scleral rings of dinosaurs and modern birds and reptiles have been used to infer daily activity patterns of dinosaurs although it has been suggested that most dinosaurs were active during the day these comparisons have shown that small predatory dinosaurs such as dromaeosaurids juravenator and megapnosaurus were likely nocturnal large and herbivorous and omnivorous dinosaurs such as ceratopsians sauropodomorphs hadrosaurids ornithomimosaurs may have been cathemeral active during short intervals throughout the day although the small ornithischian agilisaurus was inferred to be diurnalbased on current fossil evidence from dinosaurs such as oryctodromeus some ornithischian species seem to have led a partially fossorial burrowing lifestyle many modern birds are arboreal tree climbing and this was also true of many mesozoic birds especially the enantiornithines while some early species may have already been arboreal as well including dromaeosaurids such as microraptor most dinosaurs seem to have relied on locomotion a good understanding of how dinosaurs moved on the ground is key to models of dinosaur behavior the science of biomechanics pioneered by robert mcneill alexander has provided significant insight in this area for example studies of the forces exerted by muscles and gravity on dinosaurs skeletal structure have investigated how fast dinosaurs could run whether diplodocids could create sonic booms via tail snapping and whether sauropods could float communication modern birds are known to communicate using visual and auditory signals and the wide diversity of visual display structures among fossil dinosaur groups such as horns frills crests sails and feathers suggests that visual communication has always been important in dinosaur biology reconstruction of the plumage color of anchiornis huxleyi suggest the importance of color in visual communication in dinosaurs the evolution of dinosaur vocalization is less certain paleontologist phil senter suggests that dinosaurs relied mostly on visual displays and possibly acoustic sounds like hissing jaw grinding or clapping splashing and wing beating possible in winged maniraptoran dinosaurs he states they were unlikely to have been capable of vocalizing since their closest relatives crocodilians and birds use different means to vocalize the former via the larynx and the latter through the unique syrinx suggesting they evolved independently and their common ancestor was mutethe earliest remains of a syrinx which has enough mineral content for fossilization was found in a specimen of the vegavis iaai dated million years ago and this organ is unlikely to have existed in dinosaurs however in contrast to senter the researchers have suggested that dinosaurs could vocalize and that the vocal system of birds evolved from a one rather than the two systems evolving independently a study suggests that dinosaurs produced closed mouth vocalizations like cooing which occur in both crocodilians and birds as well as other reptiles such vocalizations evolved independently in extant archosaurs numerous times following increases in body size the crests of the lambeosaurini and nasal chambers of ankylosaurids have been suggested to function in vocal resonance though senter states that the presence of resonance chambers in some dinosaurs is not necessarily evidence of vocalization as modern snakes have such chambers which intensify their hisses reproductive biology all dinosaurs laid amniotic eggs with hard shells made mostly of calcium carbonate dinosaur eggs were usually laid in a nest most species create somewhat elaborate nests which can be cups domes plates beds scrapes mounds or burrows some species of modern bird have no nests the common guillemot lays its eggs on bare rock and male emperor penguins keep eggs between their body and feet primitive birds and many dinosaurs often lay eggs in communal nests with males primarily incubating the eggs while modern birds have only one functional oviduct and lay one egg at a time more primitive birds and dinosaurs had two oviducts like crocodiles some dinosaurs such as troodon exhibited iterative laying where the adult might lay a pair of eggs every one or two days and then ensured simultaneous hatching by delaying brooding until all eggs were laidwhen laying eggs females grow a special type of bone between the hard outer bone and the marrow of their limbs this medullary bone which is rich in calcium is used to make eggshells a discovery of features in a tyrannosaurus rex skeleton provided evidence of medullary bone in extinct dinosaurs and for the first time allowed paleontologists to establish the sex of a fossil dinosaur specimen further research has found medullary bone in the carnosaur allosaurus and the ornithopod tenontosaurus because the line of dinosaurs that includes allosaurus and tyrannosaurus diverged from the line that led to tenontosaurus very early in the evolution of dinosaurs this suggests that the production of medullary tissue is a general characteristic of all dinosaurs another widespread trait among modern birds but see below in regards to fossil groups and extant megapodes is parental care for young after hatching jack horner discovery of a maiasaura good mother lizard nesting ground in montana demonstrated that parental care continued long after birth among ornithopods a specimen of the mongolian oviraptorid citipati osmolskae was discovered in a brooding position in which may indicate that they had begun using an insulating layer of feathers to keep the eggs warm a dinosaur embryo pertaining to the prosauropod massospondylus was found without teeth indicating that some parental care was required to feed the young dinosaurs trackways have also confirmed parental behavior among ornithopods from the isle of skye in northwestern scotlandhowever there is ample evidence of precociality or superprecociality among many dinosaur species particularly theropods for instance birds have been abundantly demonstrated to have had slow growth rates egg burying behavior and the ability to fly soon after birth both tyrannosaurus rex and troodon formosus display juveniles with clear superprecociality and likely occupying different ecological niches than the adults superprecociality has been inferred for sauropods physiology because both modern crocodilians and birds have hearts albeit modified in crocodilians it is likely that this is a trait shared by all archosaurs including all dinosaurs while all modern birds have high metabolisms and are endothermic a vigorous debate has been ongoing since the regarding how far back in the dinosaur lineage this trait extends scientists disagree as to whether dinosaurs were endothermic ectothermic or some combination of bothafter dinosaurs were discovered paleontologists first posited that they were ectothermic this supposed was used to imply that the ancient dinosaurs were relatively slow sluggish organisms even though many modern reptiles are fast and despite relying on external sources of heat to regulate their body temperature the idea of dinosaurs as ectothermic remained a prevalent view until robert t bob bakker an early proponent of dinosaur endothermy published an influential paper on the topic in evidence indicates that some dinosaurs thrived in cooler temperate climates and that some early species must have regulated their body temperature by internal biological means aided by the animals bulk in large species and feathers or other body coverings in smaller species evidence of endothermy in mesozoic dinosaurs includes the discovery of polar dinosaurs in australia and antarctica as well as analysis of structures within fossil bones that are typical of endotherms scientific debate continues regarding the specific ways in which dinosaur temperature regulation evolved in saurischian dinosaurs higher metabolisms were supported by the evolution of the avian respiratory system characterized by an extensive system of air sacs that extended the lungs and invaded many of the bones in the skeleton making them hollow early respiratory systems with air sacs may have been capable of sustaining higher activity levels than those of mammals of similar size and build in addition to providing a very efficient supply of oxygen the rapid airflow would have been an effective cooling mechanism which is essential for animals that are active but too large to get rid of all the excess heat through their skinlike other reptiles dinosaurs are primarily uricotelic that is their kidneys extract nitrogenous wastes from their bloodstream and excrete it as uric acid instead of urea or ammonia via the ureters into the intestine in most living species uric acid is excreted along with feces as a semisolid waste however at least some modern birds such as hummingbirds can be facultatively ammonotelic excreting most of the nitrogenous wastes as ammonia this material as well as the output of the intestines emerges from the cloaca in addition many species regurgitate pellets and fossil pellets that may have come from dinosaurs are known from as long ago as the cretaceous origin of birds the possibility that dinosaurs were the ancestors of birds was first suggested in by thomas henry huxley after the work of gerhard heilmann in the early century the theory of birds as dinosaur descendants was abandoned in favor of the idea of their being descendants of generalized thecodonts with the key piece of evidence being the supposed lack of clavicles in dinosaurs however as later discoveries showed clavicles or a single fused wishbone which derived from separate clavicles were not actually absent they had been found as early as in oviraptor but misidentified as an interclavicle in the john ostrom revived the theory which gained momentum in the coming decades with the advent of cladistic analysis and a great increase in the discovery of small theropods and early birds of particular note have been the fossils of the yixian formation where a variety of theropods and early birds have been found often with feathers of some type birds share over a hundred distinct anatomical features with theropod dinosaurs which are now generally accepted to have been their closest ancient relatives they are most closely allied with maniraptoran coelurosaurs a minority of scientists most notably alan feduccia and larry martin have proposed other evolutionary paths including revised versions of heilmann basal archosaur proposal or that maniraptoran theropods are the ancestors of birds but themselves are not dinosaurs only convergent with dinosaurs feathers feathers are one of the most recognizable characteristics of modern birds and a trait that was shared by all other dinosaur groups based on the current distribution of fossil evidence it appears that feathers were an ancestral dinosaurian trait though one that may have been selectively lost in some species direct fossil evidence of feathers or structures has been discovered in a diverse array of species in many dinosaur groups both among saurischians and ornithischians simple branched structures are known from heterodontosaurids primitive neornithischians and theropods and primitive ceratopsians evidence for true vaned feathers similar to the flight feathers of modern birds has been found only in the theropod subgroup maniraptora which includes oviraptorosaurs troodontids dromaeosaurids and birds structures known as pycnofibres have also been found in pterosaurs suggesting the possibility that filaments may have been common in the bird lineage and evolved before the appearance of dinosaurs themselves research into the genetics of american alligators has also revealed that crocodylian scutes do possess during embryonic development but these keratins are not expressed by the animals before hatchingarchaeopteryx was the first fossil found that revealed a potential connection between dinosaurs and birds it is considered a transitional fossil in that it displays features of both groups brought to light just two years after charles darwin seminal on the origin of species its discovery spurred the nascent debate between proponents of evolutionary biology and creationism this early bird is so that without a clear impression of feathers in the surrounding rock at least one specimen was mistaken for compsognathus since the a number of additional feathered dinosaurs have been found providing even stronger evidence of the close relationship between dinosaurs and modern birds most of these specimens were unearthed in the lagerstatte of the yixian formation liaoning northeastern china which was part of an island continent during the cretaceous though feathers have been found in only a few locations it is possible that dinosaurs elsewhere in the world were also feathered the lack of widespread fossil evidence for feathered dinosaurs may be because delicate features like skin and feathers are not often preserved by fossilization and thus are absent from the fossil recordthe description of feathered dinosaurs has not been without controversy perhaps the most vocal critics have been alan feduccia and theagarten who have proposed that some purported fossils are the result of the decomposition of collagenous fiber that underlaid the dinosaurs skin and that maniraptoran dinosaurs with vaned feathers were not actually dinosaurs but convergent with dinosaurs however their views have for the most part not been accepted by other researchers to the point that the scientific nature of feduccia proposals has been questionedin it was reported that a dinosaur tail with feathers had been found enclosed in amber the fossil is about million years old skeleton because feathers are often associated with birds feathered dinosaurs are often touted as the missing link between birds and dinosaurs however the multiple skeletal features also shared by the two groups represent another important line of evidence for paleontologists areas of the skeleton with important similarities include the neck pubis wrist carpal arm and pectoral girdle furcula wishbone and breast bone comparison of bird and dinosaur skeletons through cladistic analysis strengthens the case for the link soft anatomy large dinosaurs had a complex system of air sacs similar to those found in modern birds according to a investigation led by patrick m the lungs of theropod dinosaurs carnivores that walked on two legs and had feet likely pumped air into hollow sacs in their skeletons as is the case in birds what was once formally considered unique to birds was present in some form in the ancestors of birds said in scientists described aerosteon riocoloradensis the skeleton of which supplies the strongest evidence to date of a dinosaur with a breathing system ct scanning of aerosteon fossil bones revealed evidence for the existence of air sacs within the animal body cavity behavioral evidence fossils of the troodonts mei and sinornithoides demonstrate that some dinosaurs slept with their heads tucked under their arms this behavior which may have helped to keep the head warm is also characteristic of modern birds several deinonychosaur and oviraptorosaur specimens have also been found preserved on top of their nests likely brooding in a manner the ratio between egg volume and body mass of adults among these dinosaurs suggest that the eggs were primarily brooded by the male and that the young were highly precocial similar to many modern birdssome dinosaurs are known to have used gizzard stones like modern birds these stones are swallowed by animals to aid digestion and break down food and hard fibers once they enter the stomach when found in association with fossils gizzard stones are called gastroliths extinction of major groups the discovery that birds are a type of dinosaur showed that dinosaurs in general are not in fact extinct as is commonly stated however all dinosaurs estimated to have been species as well as many groups of birds did suddenly become extinct approximately million years ago it has been suggested that because small mammals squamata and birds occupied the ecological niches suited for small body size dinosaurs never evolved a diverse fauna of species which led to their downfall when terrestrial tetrapods were hit by the mass extinction event many other groups of animals also became extinct at this time including ammonites mollusks mosasaurs plesiosaurs pterosaurs and many groups of mammals significantly the insects suffered no discernible population loss which left them available as food for other survivors this mass extinction is known as the extinction event the nature of the event that caused this mass extinction has been extensively studied since the at present several related theories are supported by paleontologists though the consensus is that an impact event was the primary cause of dinosaur extinction some scientists cite other possible causes or support the idea that a confluence of several factors was responsible for the sudden disappearance of dinosaurs from the fossil record impact event the asteroid impact hypothesis which was brought to wide attention in by walter alvarez and colleagues links the extinction event at the end of the cretaceous to a bolide impact approximately million years ago alvarez et al proposed that a sudden increase in iridium levels recorded around the world in the period rock stratum was direct evidence of the impact the bulk of the evidence now suggests that a bolide to kilometers to miles wide hit in the vicinity of the yucatan peninsula in southeastern mexico creating the approximately km mi chicxulub crater and triggering the mass extinction scientists are not certain whether dinosaurs were thriving or declining before the impact event some scientists propose that the meteorite impact caused a long and unnatural drop in earth atmospheric temperature while others claim that it would have instead created an unusual heat wave the consensus among scientists who support this hypothesis is that the impact caused extinctions both directly by heat from the meteorite impact and also indirectly via a worldwide cooling brought about when matter ejected from the impact crater reflected thermal radiation from the sun although the speed of extinction can not be deduced from the fossil record alone various models suggest that the extinction was extremely rapid being down to hours rather than years in scientists drilling into the seafloor off mexico extracted a unique geologic record of what they believe to be the day a asteroid smashed into the planet deccan traps before arguments that the deccan traps flood basalts caused the extinction were usually linked to the view that the extinction was gradual as the flood basalt events were thought to have started around million years ago and lasted for over million years however there is evidence that two thirds of the deccan traps were created in only million years about million years ago and so these eruptions would have caused a fairly rapid extinction possibly over a period of thousands of years but still longer than would be expected from a single impact eventthe deccan traps in india could have caused extinction through several mechanisms including the release into the air of dust and sulfuric aerosols which might have blocked sunlight and thereby reduced photosynthesis in plants in addition deccan trap volcanism might have resulted in carbon dioxide emissions which would have increased the greenhouse effect when the dust and aerosols cleared from the atmosphere before the mass extinction of the dinosaurs the release of volcanic gases during the formation of the deccan traps contributed to an apparently massive global warming some data point to an average rise in temperature of in the last years before the impact at chicxulub in the years when the deccan traps hypothesis was linked to a slower extinction luis alvarez who died in replied that paleontologists were being misled by sparse data while his assertion was not initially later intensive field studies of fossil beds lent weight to his claim eventually most paleontologists began to accept the idea that the mass extinctions at the end of the cretaceous were largely or at least partly due to a massive earth impact however even walter alvarez has acknowledged that there were other major changes on earth even before the impact such as a drop in sea level and massive volcanic eruptions that produced the indian deccan traps and these may have contributed to the extinctions possible paleocene survivors dinosaur remains are occasionally found above the boundary in paleontologist spencer g lucas et al reported the discovery of a single hadrosaur right femur in the san juan basin new mexico and described it as evidence of paleocene dinosaurs the formation in which the bone was discovered has been dated to the early paleocene epoch approximately million years ago if the bone was not into that stratum by weathering action it would provide evidence that some dinosaur populations may have survived at least a years into the cenozoic other evidence includes the finding of dinosaur remains in the hell creek formation up to m in above the boundary representing years of elapsed time similar reports have come from other parts of the world including china many scientists however dismissed the supposed paleocene dinosaurs as that is washed out of their original locations and then in much later sediments direct dating of the bones themselves has supported the later date with dating methods resulting in a precise age of million years ago if correct the presence of a handful of dinosaurs in the early paleocene would not change the underlying facts of the extinction history of study dinosaur fossils have been known for millennia although their true nature was not recognized the chinese considered them to be dragon bones and documented them as such for example huayang guo zhi Hua Yang Guo Zhi  a gazetteer compiled by chang qu Chang Qu  during the western jin dynasty reported the discovery of dragon bones at wucheng in sichuan province villagers in central china have long unearthed fossilized dragon bones for use in traditional medicines in europe dinosaur fossils were generally believed to be the remains of giants and other biblical creaturesscholarly descriptions of what would now be recognized as dinosaur bones first appeared in the late century in england part of a bone now known to have been the femur of a megalosaurus was recovered from a limestone quarry at cornwell near chipping norton oxfordshire in the fragment was sent to robert plot professor of chemistry at the university of oxford and first curator of the ashmolean museum who published a description in his the natural history of he correctly identified the bone as the lower extremity of the femur of a large animal and recognized that it was too large to belong to any known species he therefore concluded it to be the femur of a huge human perhaps a titan or another type of giant featured in legends edward lhuyd a friend of sir isaac newton published lithophylacii britannici ichnographia the first scientific treatment of what would now be recognized as a dinosaur when he described and named a sauropod tooth rutellum impicatum that had been found in caswell near witney oxfordshire between and the rev william buckland the first reader of geology at the university of oxford collected more fossilized bones of megalosaurus and became the first person to describe a dinosaur in a scientific journal the second dinosaur genus to be identified iguanodon was discovered in by mary ann mantell the wife of english geologist gideon mantell gideon mantell recognized similarities between his fossils and the bones of modern iguanas he published his findings in study of these great fossil lizards soon became of great interest to european and american scientists and in the english paleontologist richard owen coined the term dinosaur he recognized that the remains that had been found so far iguanodon megalosaurus and hylaeosaurus shared a number of distinctive features and so decided to present them as a distinct taxonomic group with the backing of prince albert the husband of queen victoria owen established the natural history museum london to display the national collection of dinosaur fossils and other biological and geological exhibitsin william parker foulke discovered the first known american dinosaur in marl pits in the small town of haddonfield new jersey although fossils had been found before their nature had not been correctly discerned the creature was named hadrosaurus foulkii it was an extremely important find hadrosaurus was one of the first nearly complete dinosaur skeletons found the first was in in maidstone england and it was clearly a bipedal creature this was a revolutionary discovery as until that point most scientists had believed dinosaurs walked on four feet like other lizards foulke discoveries sparked a wave of interests in dinosaurs in the united states known as dinosaur mania dinosaur mania was exemplified by the fierce rivalry between edward drinker cope and othniel charles marsh both of whom raced to be the first to find new dinosaurs in what came to be known as the bone wars the feud probably originated when marsh publicly pointed out that cope reconstruction of an elasmosaurus skeleton was flawed cope had inadvertently placed the plesiosaur head at what should have been the animal tail end the fight between the two scientists lasted for over years ending in when cope died after spending his entire fortune on the dinosaur hunt unfortunately many valuable dinosaur specimens were damaged or destroyed due to the pair rough methods for example their diggers often used dynamite to unearth bones modern paleontologists would find such methods crude and unacceptable since blasting easily destroys fossil and stratigraphic evidence despite their unrefined methods the contributions of cope and marsh to paleontology were vast marsh unearthed new species of dinosaur and cope discovered a total of new species cope collection is now at the american museum of natural history while marsh is on display at the peabody museum of natural history at yale universityafter the search for dinosaur fossils extended to every continent including antarctica the first antarctic dinosaur to be discovered the ankylosaurid antarctopelta oliveroi was found on james ross island in although it was before an antarctic species the theropod cryolophosaurus ellioti was formally named and described in a scientific journalcurrent dinosaur hot spots include southern south america especially argentina and china china in particular has produced many exceptional feathered dinosaur specimens due to the unique geology of its dinosaur beds as well as an ancient arid climate particularly conducive to fossilization dinosaur renaissance the field of dinosaur research has enjoyed a surge in activity that began in the and is ongoing this was triggered in part by john ostrom discovery of deinonychus an active predator that may have been in marked contrast to the image of dinosaurs as sluggish and vertebrate paleontology has become a global science major new dinosaur discoveries have been made by paleontologists working in previously unexploited regions including india south america madagascar antarctica and most significantly china the feathered dinosaurs in china have further consolidated the link between dinosaurs and their living descendants modern birds the widespread application of cladistics which rigorously analyzes the relationships between biological organisms has also proved tremendously useful in classifying dinosaurs cladistic analysis among other modern techniques helps to compensate for an often incomplete and fragmentary fossil record soft tissue and dna one of the best examples of impressions in a fossil dinosaur was discovered in the pietraroia plattenkalk in southern italy the discovery was reported in and described the specimen of a small very young coelurosaur scipionyx samniticus the fossil includes portions of the intestines colon liver muscles and windpipe of this immature dinosaurin the march issue of science the paleontologist mary higby schweitzer and her team announced the discovery of flexible material resembling actual soft tissue inside a tyrannosaurus rex leg bone from the hell creek formation in montana after recovery the tissue was rehydrated by the science team when the fossilized bone was treated over several weeks to remove mineral content from the fossilized cavity a process called demineralization schweitzer found evidence of intact structures such as blood vessels bone matrix and connective tissue bone fibers scrutiny under the microscope further revealed that the putative dinosaur soft tissue had retained fine structures microstructures even at the cellular level the exact nature and composition of this material and the implications of schweitzer discovery are not yet clearin a team including schweitzer announced that using even more careful methodology they had duplicated their results by finding similar soft tissue in a dinosaur brachylophosaurus canadensis found in the judith river formation of montana this included even more detailed tissue down to preserved bone cells that seem even to have visible remnants of nuclei and what seem to be red blood cells among other materials found in the bone was collagen as in the tyrannosaurus bone the type of collagen an animal has in its bones varies according to its dna and in both cases this collagen was of the same type found in modern chickens and ostrichesthe extraction of ancient dna from dinosaur fossils has been reported on two separate occasions upon further inspection and peer review however neither of these reports could be confirmed however a functional peptide involved in the vision of a theoretical dinosaur has been inferred using analytical phylogenetic reconstruction methods on gene sequences of related modern species such as reptiles and birds in addition several proteins including hemoglobin have putatively been detected in dinosaur fossilsin researchers reported finding structures similar to blood cells and collagen fibers preserved in the bone fossils of six cretaceous dinosaur specimens which are approximately million years old cultural depictions by human standards dinosaurs were creatures of fantastic appearance and often enormous size as such they have captured the popular imagination and become an enduring part of human culture the entry of the word dinosaur into the common vernacular reflects the animals cultural importance in english dinosaur is commonly used to describe anything that is impractically large obsolete or bound for extinctionpublic enthusiasm for dinosaurs first developed in victorian england where in three decades after the first scientific descriptions of dinosaur remains a menagerie of lifelike dinosaur sculptures was unveiled in london crystal palace park the crystal palace dinosaurs proved so popular that a strong market in smaller replicas soon developed in subsequent decades dinosaur exhibits opened at parks and museums around the world ensuring that successive generations would be introduced to the animals in an immersive and exciting way dinosaurs enduring popularity in its turn has resulted in significant public funding for dinosaur science and has frequently spurred new discoveries in the united states for example the competition between museums for public attention led directly to the bone wars of the and during which a pair of feuding paleontologists made enormous scientific contributionsthe popular preoccupation with dinosaurs has ensured their appearance in literature film and other media beginning in with a passing mention in charles dickens bleak house dinosaurs have been featured in large numbers of fictional works jules verne novel journey to the center of the earth sir arthur conan doyle book the lost world the iconic film king kong the godzilla and its many sequels the novel jurassic park by michael crichton and its film adaptation are just a few notable examples of dinosaur appearances in fiction authors of works about dinosaurs including some prominent paleontologists who have often sought to use the animals as a way to educate readers about science in general dinosaurs are ubiquitous in advertising numerous companies have referenced dinosaurs in printed or televised advertisements either in order to sell their own products or in order to characterize their rivals as or obsolete
