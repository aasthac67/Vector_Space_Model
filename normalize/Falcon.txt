falcons are birds of prey in the genus falco which includes about species falcons are widely distributed on all continents of the world except antarctica though closely related raptors did occur there in the eoceneadult falcons have thin tapered wings which enable them to fly at high speed and change direction rapidly fledgling falcons in their first year of flying have longer flight feathers which make their configuration more like that of a bird such as a this makes flying easier while learning the exceptional skills required to be effective hunters as adults the falcons are the largest genus in the falconinae subfamily of falconidae which itself also includes another subfamily comprising caracaras and a few other species all these birds kill with their beaks using a tooth on the side of their the hawks eagles and other birds of prey in the accipitridae which use their feet the largest falcon is the gyrfalcon at up to cm in length the smallest falcon species is the pygmy falcon which measures just cm as with hawks and owls falcons exhibit sexual dimorphism with the females typically larger than the males thus allowing a wider range of prey speciessome small falcons with long narrow wings are called hobbies and some which hover while hunting are called kestrels as is the case with many birds of prey falcons have exceptional powers of vision the visual acuity of one species has been measured at times that of a normal human peregrine falcons have been recorded diving at speeds of miles per hour making them the creatures on earth the fastest recorded dive for one is kilometers per hour mph etymology the genus name falco is from late latin falx falcis a sickle referring to the claws of the bird in middle english and old french the title faucon refers generically to several captive raptor speciesthe traditional term for a male falcon is tercel british spelling or tiercel american spelling from the latin tertius third because of the belief that only one in three eggs hatched a male bird some sources give the etymology as deriving from the fact that a male falcon is about smaller than a female old french tiercelet a falcon chick especially one reared for falconry still in its downy stage is known as an eyas sometimes spelled eyass the word arose by mistaken division of old french un niais from latin presumed nidiscus nestling from nidus nest the technique of hunting with trained captive birds of prey is known as falconry systematics and evolution compared to other birds of prey the fossil record of the falcons is not well distributed in time the oldest fossils tentatively assigned to this genus are from the late miocene less than million years ago this coincides with a period in which many modern genera of birds became recognizable in the fossil record the falcon lineage may however be somewhat older than this and given the distribution of fossil and living falco taxa is probably of north american african or possibly middle eastern or european origin falcons are not closely related to other birds of prey and their nearest relatives are parrots and songbirds overview falcons are roughly divisible into three or four groups the first contains the kestrels probably excepting the american kestrel usually small and stocky falcons of mainly brown upperside color and sometimes sexually dimorphic three african species that are generally gray in color stand apart from the typical members of this group kestrels feed chiefly on terrestrial vertebrates and invertebrates of appropriate size such as rodents reptiles or insects the second group contains slightly larger on average species the hobbies and relatives these birds are characterized by considerable amounts of dark in their plumage their malar areas are nearly always black they feed mainly on smaller birds third are the peregrine falcon and its relatives variably sized powerful birds that also have a black malar area except some very light color morphs and often a black cap as well otherwise they are somewhat intermediate between the other groups being chiefly medium gray with some lighter or brownish colors on their upper sides they are on average more delicately patterned than the hobbies and if the hierofalcons are excluded see below this group typically contains species with horizontal barring on their undersides as opposed to the other groups where tail color varies much in general but little according to evolutionary relatedness however the fox and greater kestrels can be told apart at first glance by their tail colors but not by much else they might be very close relatives and are probably much closer to each other than the lesser and common kestrels the tails of the large falcons are quite uniformly dark gray with inconspicuous black banding and small white tips though this is probably plesiomorphic these large falco species feed on birds and terrestrial vertebrates very similar to these and sometimes included therein are the four or so species of hierofalcons literally they represent taxa with usually more phaeomelanins which impart reddish or brown colors and generally more strongly patterned plumage reminiscent of hawks their undersides have a lengthwise pattern of blotches lines or arrowhead marks while these three or four groups loosely circumscribed are an informal arrangement they probably contain several distinct clades in their entirety a study of mtdna cytochrome b sequence data of some kestrels identified a clade containing the common kestrel and related species to the exclusion of such taxa as the greater kestrel which lacks a malar stripe the lesser kestrel which is very similar to the common but also has no malar stripe and the american kestrel which has a malar stripe but its color from the brownish also the black feathers behind the ear which never occur in the true kestrels are more reminiscent of some hobbies the kestrels apparently split from their relatives in the gelasian roughly million years ago mya and are seemingly of tropical east african origin the entire true kestrel the american probably a distinct and quite young clade as also suggested by their numerous apomorphies other studies have confirmed that the hierofalcons are a monophyletic that hybridization is quite frequent at least in the larger falcon species initial studies of mtdna cytochrome b sequence data suggested that the hierofalcons are basal among living falcons the discovery of a numt proved this earlier theory erroneous in reality the hierofalcons are a rather young group originating at the same time as the start of the main kestrel radiation about mya very little fossil history exists for this lineage however the present diversity of very recent origin suggests that this lineage may have nearly gone extinct in the recent pastthe phylogeny and delimitations of the peregrine and hobbies groups are more problematic molecular studies have only been conducted on a few species and the morphologically ambiguous taxa have often been little researched the morphology of the syrinx which contributes well to resolving the overall phylogeny of the falconidae is not very informative in the present genus nonetheless a core group containing the peregrine and barbary falcons which in turn group with the hierofalcons and the more distant prairie falcon which was sometimes placed with the hierofalcons though it is entirely distinct biogeographically as well as at least most of the typical hobbies are confirmed to be monophyletic as suspectedgiven that the american falco species of today belong to the peregrine group or are apparently more basal species the initially most successful evolutionary radiation seemingly was a holarctic one that originated possibly around central eurasia or in northern africa one or several lineages were present in north america by the early pliocene at latest the origin of today major falco typical hobbies and kestrels for example or the complex or the aplomado falcon be quite confidently placed from the boundary through the zanclean and piacenzian and just into the gelasian that is from mya when the kestrels diversified some groups of falcons such as the hierofalcon complex and the superspecies have only evolved in more recent times the species of the former seem to be years old or so species the sequence follows the taxonomic

described see species accounts for these sushkinia pliocaena from the early pliocene of pavlodar kazakhstan appears to be a falcon of some sort it might belong in this genus or a closely related one in any case the genus name sushkinia is invalid for this animal because it had already been allocated to a prehistoric dragonfly relative in the bird genus was renamed psushkiniathe supposed falco pisanus was actually a pigeon of the genus columba possibly the same as columba omnisanctorum which in that case would adopt the older species name of the falcon the eocene fossil falco falconellus or f falconella from wyoming is a bird of uncertain affiliations maybe a falconid maybe not it certainly does not belong in this genus falco readei is now considered a paleosubspecies of the caracara
