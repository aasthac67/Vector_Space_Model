the reindeer rangifer tarandus also known as the caribou in north america is a species of deer with circumpolar distribution native to arctic tundra boreal and mountainous regions of northern europe siberia and north america this includes both sedentary and migratory populations rangifer herd size varies greatly in different geographic regions the taimyr herd of migrating siberian tundra reindeer r t sibiricus in russia is the largest wild reindeer herd in the world varying between and what was once the second largest herd is the migratory boreal woodland caribou r t caribou george river herd in canada with former variations between and as of january there are fewer than animals estimated to be left in the george river herd as reported by the canadian broadcasting corporation the new york times reported in april of the disappearance of the only herd of southern mountain caribou in the contiguous united states with an expert calling it functionally extinct after the herd size dwindled to a mere three animalsrangifer varies in size and colour from the smallest the svalbard reindeer to the largest the boreal woodland caribou the north american range of caribou extends from alaska through yukon the northwest territories and nunavut into the boreal forest and south through the canadian rockies and the columbia and selkirk mountains the caribou porcupine caribou and peary caribou live in the tundra while the shy boreal woodland caribou prefer the boreal forest the porcupine caribou and the caribou form large herds and undertake lengthy seasonal migrations from birthing grounds to summer and winter feeding grounds in the tundra and taiga the migrations of porcupine caribou herds are among the longest of any mammal caribou are also found in kitaa in greenland but the larger herds are in alaska the northwest territories and nunavutsome subspecies are rare and at least one has already become extinct the queen charlotte islands caribou of canada historically the range of the sedentary boreal woodland caribou covered more than half of canada and into the northern states in the us woodland caribou have disappeared from most of their original southern range and were designated as threatened in by the committee on the status of endangered wildlife in canada cosewic environment canada reported in that there were approximately boreal woodland caribou in ranges remaining in canada environment canada siberian tundra reindeer herds are in decline and rangifer tarandus is considered to be vulnerable by the iucn arctic peoples have depended on caribou for food clothing and shelter such as the caribou inuit the inuit of the kivalliq region in northern canada the caribou clan in yukon the inupiat the inuvialuit the han the northern tutchone and the who followed the porcupine caribou for millennia hunting wild reindeer and herding of reindeer are important to several arctic and peoples such as the duhalar for meat hides antlers milk and transportation the sami people sapmi have also depended on reindeer herding and fishing for centuries in sapmi reindeer pull pulksmale and female reindeer can grow antlers annually although the proportion of females that grow antlers varies greatly between population and season antlers are typically larger on males in traditional festive legend santa claus reindeer pull a sleigh through the night sky to help santa claus deliver gifts to good children on christmas eve naming carl linnaeus chose the name rangifer for the reindeer genus which albertus magnus used in his de animalibus fol liber cap dicitur rangyfer quasi ramifer this word may go back to the saami word raingo linnaeus chose the word tarandus as the specific epithet making reference to ulisse aldrovandi quadrupedum omnium bisulcorum historia fol cap de tarando however aldrovandi and konrad gesner thought that rangifer and tarandus were two separate animals in any case the tarandos name goes back to aristotle and theophrastus the use of the terms reindeer and caribou for essentially the same animal can cause confusion but the international union for conservation of nature clearly delineates the issue the world caribou and reindeer are classified as a single species rangifer tarandus reindeer is the european name for the species while in north america the species is known as caribou the word rein is of norse origin the word deer was originally broader in meaning but became more specific over time in middle english der meant a wild animal of any kind in contrast to cattle the word caribou comes through french from the qalipu meaning snow shoveler and referring to its habit of pawing through the snow for foodbecause of its importance to many cultures rangifer tarandus and some of its subspecies have names in many languages inuktitut is spoken in the eastern arctic and the caribou is known by the name tuktu the gwich in people have over two dozen distinct wordsnames for reindeer in languages spoken throughout their former native range taxonomy and evolution the species taxonomic name rangifer tarandus was defined by carl linnaeus in the woodland caribou subspecies taxonomic name rangifer tarandus caribou was defined by gmelin in based on banfield a revision of the reindeer and caribou genus rangifer r t caboti the labrador caribou r t osborni osborn british columbia and r t terraenovae the newfoundland caribou were considered invalid and included in r t caribou some recent authorities have considered them all valid even suggesting that they are quite distinct in their book entitled mammal species of the world american zoologist don e wilson and deeann reeder agree with valerius geist specialist on large north american mammals that this range actually includes several subspeciesgeist argued that the true woodland caribou the uniformly dark type with the frontally emphasised antlers which is scattered thinly along the southern rim of north american caribou distribution has been incorrectly classified he affirms that the true woodland caribou is very rare in very great difficulties and requires the most urgent of attention in an analysis of mtdna found differences between the caribou from newfoundland labrador southwestern canada and southeastern canada but maintained all in r t cariboumallory and hillis argued that although the taxonomic designations reflect evolutionary events they do not appear to reflect current ecological conditions in numerous instances populations of the same subspecies have evolved different demographic and behavioural adaptations while populations from separate subspecies have evolved similar demographic and behavioural patterns u nderstanding ecotype in relation to existing ecological constraints and releases may be more important than the taxonomic relationships between populations current classifications of rangifer tarandus either with prevailing taxonomy on subspecies designations based on ecotypes or natural population groupings fail to capture the variability of caribou across their range in canada needed for effective species conservation and management across the range of a species individuals may display considerable morphological genetic and behavioural variability reflective of both plasticity and adaptation to local environments cosewic developed designated unit du

divided by ecotype depending on several behavioural factors predominant habitat use northern tundra mountain forest boreal forest woodland woodland boreal woodland migratory or woodland mountain spacing dispersed or aggregated and migration patterns sedentary or migratory the cycles of the upper pleistocene had a major influence on the evolution of rangifer tarandus and other arctic and species isolation of rangifer tarandus in refugia during the last glacial the wisconsin in north america and the weichselian in intraspecific genetic variability particularly between the north american and eurasian parts of the arctic in kurten reported that the oldest reindeer fossil was an antler of tundra reindeer type from the sands of sussenborn in the pleistocene gunz period to bp by the period to bp its european range was very extensive reindeer occurred in spain italy and southern russia reindeer was particularly abundant in the magdalenian deposits from the late part of the just before the end of the ice age at that time and at the early mesolithic it was the game animal for many tribes the supply began to get low during the mesolithic when reindeer retired to the north in spite of the great variation all the pleistocene and living reindeer belong to the same species humans started hunting reindeer in the mesolithic and neolithic periods and humans are today the main predator in many areas norway and greenland have unbroken traditions of hunting wild reindeer from the last glacial period until the present day in the mountains of central norway such as jotunheimen it is still possible to find remains of trapping pits guiding fences and bow rests built especially for hunting reindeer these can with some certainty be dated to the migration period although it is not unlikely that they have been in use since the stone age physical characteristics antlers in most populations both sexes grow antlers the reindeer is the only cervid species in which females grow them as well as males androgens play essential role in cervids antler formation the antlerogenic genes in reindeer have more sensitivity to androgens in comparison with other cervidsthere is considerable variation between subspecies in the size of the antlers eg they are rather small and spindly in the northernmost subspecies but on average the bull reindeer antlers are the second largest of any extant deer after the moose in the largest subspecies the antlers of large males can range up to cm in in width and cm in in beam length they have the largest antlers relative to body size among living deer species antler size measured in number of points reflects the nutritional status of the reindeer and climate variation of its environment the number of points on male reindeer increases from birth to five years of age and remains relatively constant from then on in male caribou antler mass but not the number of tines varies in concert with body mass while antlers of bull woodland caribou are typically smaller than caribou they can be over one metre across they are flattened compact and relatively dense geist describes them as frontally emphasised antlers woodland caribou antlers are thicker and broader than those of the caribou and their legs and heads are longer bull caribou antlers can be significantly larger and wider than other woodland caribou central bull caribou are perhaps the most diverse in configuration and can grow to be very high and wide mountain caribou are typically the most massive with the largest circumference measurementsthe antlers main beams begin at the brow extending posterior over the shoulders and bowing so that the tips point forward the prominent palmate brow tines extend forward over the face the antlers typically have two separate groups of points lower and upper antlers begin to grow on male reindeer in march or april and on female reindeer in may or june this process is called antlerogenesis antlers grow very quickly every year on the males as the antlers grow they are covered in thick velvet filled with blood vessels and spongy in texture the antler velvet of the caribou and boreal woodland caribou is dark chocolate brown the velvet that covers growing antlers is a highly vascularised skin this velvet is dark brown on woodland or caribou and on peary caribou and the caribou herd velvet lumps in march can develop into a rack measuring more than a metre in length ft by augustwhen the antler growth is fully grown and hardened the velvet is shed or rubbed off to the inuit for whom the caribou is a culturally important keystone species the months are named after landmarks in the caribou life cycle for example amiraijaut in the igloolik region is when velvet falls off caribou antlers male reindeer use their antlers to compete with other males during the mating season in describing woodland caribou sara wrote during the rut males engage in frequent and furious sparring battles with their antlers large males with large antlers do most of the mating reindeer continue to migrate until the bull reindeer have spent the back fatin late autumn or early winter after the rut male reindeer lose their antlers growing a new pair the next summer with a larger rack than the previous year female reindeer keep their antlers until they calve in the scandinavian populations old males antlers fall off in december young males fall off in the early spring and females fall off in the summer when bull reindeer shed their antlers in early to midwinter the antlered female reindeer acquire the highest ranks in the feeding hierarchy gaining access to the best forage areas these cows are healthier than those without antlers calves whose mothers do not have antlers are more prone to disease and have a significantly higher mortality females in good nutritional condition for example during a mild winter with good winter range quality may grow new antlers earlier as antler growth requires high intakeaccording to a respected igloolik elder noah piugaattuk who was one of the last outpost camp leaders caribou tuktu antlers get detached every young males lose the velvet from the antlers much more quickly than female caribou even though they are not fully mature they start to work with their antlers just as soon as the velvet starts to fall off the young males engage in fights with their antlers towards after the velvet had fallen off they will be red as they start to get bleached their colour when the velvet starts to fall off the antler is red because the antler is made from blood the antler is the blood that has hardened in fact the core of the antler is still bloody when the velvet starts to fall off at least close to the base according to the igloolik oral history project iohp caribou antlers provided the inuit with a myriad of implements from snow knives and shovels to drying racks and tools a complex set of terms describes each part of the antler and relates it to its various uses currently the larger racks of antlers are used by inuit as materials for carving jackoposie oopakak carving entitled nunali which means place where people live and which is part of the permanent collection of the national gallery of canada includes a massive set of caribou antlers on which he has intricately carved the miniaturised world of the inuit where arctic birds caribou polar bears seals and whales are interspersed with human activities of fishing hunting cleaning skins stretching boots and travelling by dog sled and kayak from the base of the antlers to the tip of each branch pelt the colour of the fur varies considerably both between individuals and depending on season and subspecies northern populations which usually are relatively small are whiter while southern populations which typically are relatively large are darker this can be seen well in north america where the northernmost subspecies the peary caribou is the whitest and smallest subspecies of the continent while the southernmost subspecies the boreal woodland caribou is the darkest and largestthe coat has two layers of fur a dense woolly undercoat and overcoat consisting of hollow hairs fur is the primary insulation factor that allows reindeer to regulate their core body temperature in relation to their environment the thermogradient even if the temperature rises to in dugmore noted how the woodland caribou swim so high out of the water unlike any other mammal because their hollow hair acts as a supporting life jacket a darker belly color may be caused by two mutations of they appear to be more common in domestic herds heat exchange blood moving into the legs is cooled by blood returning to the body in a countercurrent heat exchange cche a highly efficient means of minimising heat loss through the skin surface in the cche mechanism in cold weather blood vessels are closely knotted and intertwined with arteries to the skin and appendages that carry warm blood with veins returning to the body that carry cold blood causing the warm arterial blood to exchange heat with the cold venous blood in this way their legs for example are kept cool maintaining the core body temperature nearly higher with less heat lost to the environment heat is thus recycled instead of being dissipated the heart does not have to pump blood as rapidly in order to maintain a constant body core temperature and thus metabolic rate cche is present in animals like reindeer fox and moose living in extreme conditions of cold or hot weather as a mechanism for retaining the heat in or out of the body these are countercurrent exchange systems with the same fluid usually blood in a circuit used for both directions of flowreindeer have specialised vascular heat exchange in their nasal passages temperature gradient along the nasal mucosa is under physiological control incoming cold air is warmed by body heat before entering the lungs and water is condensed from the expired air and captured before the reindeer breath is exhaled then used to moisten dry incoming air and possibly be absorbed into the blood through the mucous membranes like moose caribou have specialised noses featuring nasal turbinate bones that dramatically increase the surface area within the nostrils hooves the reindeer has large feet with cloven hooves for walking in snow or swamps according to the species at risk public registry sara woodland caribou have large feet with four toes in addition to two small ones called dew claws they have two large toes that support most of their weight and serve as shovels when digging for food under snow these large concave hooves offer stable support on wet soggy ground and on crusty snow the pads of the hoof change from a thick fleshy shape in the summer to become hard and thin in the winter months reducing the animal s exposure to the cold ground additional winter protection comes from the long hair between the toes it covers the pads so the caribou walks only on the horny rim of the hooves reindeer hooves adapt to the season in the summer when the tundra is soft and wet the footpads become and provide extra traction in the winter the pads shrink and tighten exposing the rim of the hoof which cuts into the ice and crusted snow to keep it from slipping this also enables them to dig down an activity known as cratering through the snow to their favourite food a lichen known as reindeer lichen cladonia rangiferina size the females usually measure cm in in length and weigh kg lb the males or bulls as they are often called are typically larger to an extent which varies between the different subspecies measuring cm in in length and usually weighing kg lb exceptionally large males have weighed as much as kg lb weight varies drastically between seasons with males losing as much as of their weightshoulder height is usually to cm to in and the tail is to cm to in long the reindeer from svalbard are the smallest they are also relatively and may have a shoulder height of as little as cm in norwegian polar institute thereby following allen rule clicking sound the knees of many subspecies of reindeer are adapted to produce a clicking sound as they walk the sounds originate in the tendons of the knees and may be audible from ten meters away the frequency of the is one of a range of signals that establish relative positions on a dominance scale among reindeer specifically loud is discovered to be an honest signal of body size providing an exceptional example of the potential for acoustic communication in mammals the clicking sound made by reindeer as they walk is caused by small tendons slipping over bone protuberances sesamoid bones in their feet the sound is made when a reindeer is walking or running occurring when the full weight of the foot is on the ground or just after it is relieved of the weight eyes a study by researchers from university college london in revealed that reindeer can see light with wavelengths as short as nm ie in the ultraviolet range considerably below the human threshold of nm it is thought that this ability helps them to survive in the arctic because many objects that blend into the landscape in light visible to humans such as urine and fur produce sharp contrasts in ultraviolet the tapetum lucidum of arctic reindeer eyes changes in colour from gold in summer to blue in winter to improve their vision during times of continuous darkness and perhaps enable them to better spot predators biology and behaviour seasonal body composition reindeer have developed adaptations for optimal metabolic efficiency during warm months as well as for during cold months the body composition of reindeer varies highly with the seasons of particular interest is the body composition and diet of breeding and females between seasons breeding females have more body mass than females between the months of march and september with a difference of around kg more than females from november to december females have more body mass than breeding females as females are able to focus their energies towards storage during colder months rather than lactation and reproduction body masses of both breeding and females peaks in september during the months of march through april breeding females have more fat mass than the females with a difference of almost kg after this however nonbreeding females on average have a higher fat mass than the breeding femalesthe environmental variations play a large part in reindeer nutrition as winter nutrition is crucial to adult and neonatal survival rates lichens are a staple during the winter months as they are a readily available food source which reduces the reliance on stored body reserves lichens are a crucial part of the reindeer diet however they are less prevalent in the diet of pregnant reindeer compared to individuals the amount of lichen in a diet is found more in adult diets than pregnant individuals due to the lack of nutritional value although lichens are high in carbohydrates they are lacking in essential proteins that vascular plants provide the amount of lichen in a diet decreases in latitude which results in nutritional stress being higher in areas with low lichen abundance reproduction and reindeer mate in late september to early november and the gestation period is about days during the mating season males battle for access to females two males will lock each other antlers together and try to push each other away the most dominant males can collect as many as females to mate with a male will stop eating during this time and lose much of his body reservesto calve females travel to isolated relatively areas such as islands in lakes peatlands lakeshores or tundra as females select the habitat for the birth of their calves they are more wary than males dugmore noted that in their seasonal migrations the herd follows a doe for that reason newborns weigh on average kg lb in may or june the calves are born after days the calves are able to graze and forage but continue suckling until the following autumn when they become independent from their mothersmales live four years less than the females whose maximum longevity is about years females with a normal body size and who have had sufficient summer nutrition can begin breeding anytime between the ages of one to three years when a female has undergone nutritional stress it is possible for her to not reproduce for the year dominant males those with larger body size and antler racks inseminate more than one doe a season social structure migration and range some populations of north american caribou for example many herds in the caribou subspecies and some woodland caribou in ungava and labrador migrate the farthest of any terrestrial mammal travelling up to km mi a year and covering sq mi other north american populations the boreal woodland caribou for example are largely sedentary the european populations are known to have shorter migrations island herds such as the subspecies r t pearsoni and r t platyrhynchus make local movements migrating reindeer can be negatively affected by parasite loads severely infected individuals are weak and probably have shortened lifespans but parasite levels vary between populations infections create an effect known as culling infected migrating animals are less likely to complete the migrationnormally travelling about km mi a day while migrating the caribou can run at speeds of mph young caribou can already outrun an olympic sprinter when only a day old during the spring migration smaller herds will group together to form larger herds of to animals but during autumn migrations the groups become smaller and the reindeer begin to mate during winter reindeer travel to forested areas to forage under the snow by spring groups leave their winter grounds to go to the calving grounds a reindeer can swim easily and quickly normally at about mph but if necessary at mph and migrating herds will not hesitate to swim across a large lake or broad river as an adaptation to their arctic environment they have lost their circadian rhythm ecology distribution and habitat originally the reindeer was found in scandinavia eastern europe greenland russia mongolia and northern china north of the latitude in north america it was found in canada alaska and the northern conterminous usa from washington to maine in the century it was apparently still present in southern idaho even in historical times it probably occurred naturally in ireland during the late pleistocene era reindeer occurred as far south as nevada and tennessee in north america and as far south as spain in europe today wild reindeer have disappeared from these areas especially from the southern parts where it vanished almost everywhere large populations of wild reindeer are still found in norway finland siberia greenland alaska and canada according to the grubb rangifer tarandus is circumboreal in the tundra and taiga from svalbard norway finland russia alaska usa and canada including most arctic islands and greenland south to northern mongolia china inner mongolia now only domesticated or feral sakhalin island and usa northern idaho and the great lakes region reindeer were introduced to and feral in iceland kerguelen islands south georgia island pribilof islands st matthew island there is strong regional variation in rangifer herd size there are large population differences among individual herds and the size of individual herds has varied greatly since the largest of all herds in taimyr russia has varied between and the second largest herd at the george river in canada has varied between and while rangifer is a widespread and numerous genus in the northern holarctic being present in both tundra and taiga boreal forest by many herds had unusually low numbers and their winter ranges in particular were smaller than they used to be caribou and reindeer numbers have fluctuated historically but many herds are in decline across their range this global decline is linked to climate change for northern migratory herds and industrial disturbance of habitat for herds caribou are susceptible to the effects of climate change due to a mismatch in the phenological process between the availability of food during the calving period in november it was reported that more than reindeer in russia had died as a result of climate change longer autumns leading to increased amounts of freezing rain created a few inches of ice over lichen starving many reindeer diet reindeer are ruminants having a stomach they mainly eat lichens in winter especially reindeer lichen a unique adaptation among mammals they are the only large mammal able to metabolise lichen owing to specialised bacteria and protozoa in their gut they are the only animals except for some gastropods in which the enzyme lichenase which breaks down lichenin to glucose has been found however they also eat the leaves of willows and birches as well as sedges and grasses they have been known to eat their own fallen antlers probably for calcium there is also some evidence to suggest that on occasion especially in the spring when they are nutritionally stressed they will feed on small rodents such as lemmings fish such as arctic char and bird eggs reindeer herded by the chukchis have been known to devour mushrooms enthusiastically in late summerduring the arctic summer when there is continuous daylight reindeer change their sleeping pattern from one synchronised with the sun to an ultradian pattern in which they sleep when they need to digest food predators a variety of predators prey heavily on reindeer including overhunting by people in some areas which contributes to the decline of populationsgolden eagles prey on calves and are the most prolific hunter on the calving grounds wolverines will take newborn calves or birthing cows as well as less commonly infirm adults brown bears and polar bears prey on reindeer of all ages but like the wolverines they are most likely to attack weaker animals such as calves and sick reindeer since healthy adult reindeer can usually outpace a bear the grey wolf is the most effective natural predator of adult reindeer and sometimes takes large numbers especially during the winter some wolf packs as well as individual grizzly bears in canada may follow and live off of a particular reindeer herd year roundadditionally as carrion reindeer may be scavenged opportunistically by foxes hawks and ravens bloodsucking insects such as mosquitoes culicidae black flies simuliidae and botflies and deer botflies oestridae specifically the reindeer warble fly hypoderma tarandi and the reindeer nose botfly cephenemyia trompe are a plague to reindeer during the summer and can cause enough stress to inhibit feeding and calving behaviours an adult reindeer will lose perhaps about liter about us pints of blood to biting insects for every week it spends in the tundra the population numbers of some of these predators is influenced by the migration of reindeer tormenting insects keep caribou on the move searching for windy areas like hilltops and mountain ridges rock reefs lakeshore and forest openings or snow patches that offer respite from the buzzing horde gathering in large herds is another strategy that caribou use to block insectsin one case the entire body of a reindeer was found in the stomach of a greenland shark a species found in the far northern atlantic although this was possibly a case of scavenging considering the dissimilarity of habitats between the ungulate and the large fish other threats deer odocoileus virginianus commonly carry meningeal worm or brainworm a nematode parasite that causes reindeer moose alces alces elk cervus canadensis and mule deer odocoileus hemionus to develop fatal neurological symptoms which include a loss of fear of humans deer that carry this worm are partly immune to itchanges in climate and habitat beginning in the twentieth century have expanded range overlap between deer and caribou increasing the frequency of infection within the reindeer population this increase in infection is a concern for wildlife managers human activities such as forestry practices forest fires and the clearing for agriculture roadways railways and power lines favour the conversion of habitats into the preferred habitat of the open forest interspersed with meadows clearings grasslands and riparian flatlands conservation current status while overall widespread and numerous some subspecies are rare and at least one has already gone extinct as of the iucn has classified the reindeer as vulnerable due to an observed population decline of over the last years according to iucn rangifer tarandus as a species is not endangered because of its overall large population and its widespread rangein north america r t dawsoni is extinct r t pearyi is endangered r t caribou is designated as threatened and some individual populations are endangered while the subspecies r t granti and r t groenlandicus are not designated as threatened many individual some of the declining and there is much concern at the local levelrangifer tarandus is endangered in canada in regions such as british columbia at the border along the columbia kootenay and kootenai rivers and around kootenay lake rangifer tarandus is endangered in the united states in idaho and washington there is strong regional variation in rangifer herd size by many caribou herds in north america had unusually low numbers and their winter ranges in particular were smaller than they used to be caribou numbers have fluctuated historically but many herds are in decline across their range there are many factors contributing to the decline in numbers boreal woodland caribou cosewic designation as threatened ongoing human development of their habitat has caused populations of woodland caribou to disappear from their original southern range in particular caribou were extirpated in many areas of eastern north america in the beginning of the century woodland caribou were designated as threatened in environment canada reported in that there were approximately boreal woodland caribou in ranges remaining in canada environment canada professor marco musiani of the university of calgary said in a statement that the woodland caribou is already an endangered species in southern canada and the united states the warming of the planet means the disappearance of their critical habitat in these regions caribou need undisturbed environments and these types of habitats are disappearing woodland caribou have disappeared from most of their original southern range and were designated as threatened in by the committee on the status of endangered wildlife in canada cosewic environment canada reported in that there were approximately boreal woodland caribou in ranges remaining in canada environment canada according to geist the woodland caribou is highly endangered throughout its distribution right into ontario in the population of the woodland caribou was designated as endangered by cosewic the small isolated population of animals was at risk from predation and habitat loss peary caribou cosewic designation as endangered in cosewic assigned endangered status to the banks island and high arctic populations of peary caribou the low arctic population of peary caribou was designated as threatened by all three were designated as endangered numbers have declined by about over the last three generations mostly because of catastrophic likely related to severe icing episodes the ice covers the vegetation and caribou starve voluntary restrictions on hunting by local people are in place but have not stopped population declines because of the continuing decline and expected changes in weather patterns this subspecies is at imminent risk of extinction relationship with humans the reindeer has an important economic role for all circumpolar peoples including the saami the nenets the khants the evenks the yukaghirs the chukchi and the koryaks in eurasia it is believed that domestication started between the bronze and iron ages siberian reindeer owners also use the reindeer to ride on siberian reindeer are larger than their scandinavian relatives for breeders a single owner may own hundreds or even thousands of animals the numbers of russian reindeer herders have been drastically reduced since the fall of the soviet union the sale of fur and meat is an important source of income reindeer were introduced into alaska near the end of the century they interbred with the native caribou subspecies there reindeer herders on the seward peninsula have experienced significant losses to their herds from animals such as wolves following the wild caribou during their migrationsreindeer meat is popular in the scandinavian countries reindeer meatballs are sold canned sauteed reindeer is the dish in sapmi in alaska and finland reindeer sausage is sold in supermarkets and grocery stores reindeer meat is very tender and lean it can be prepared fresh but also dried salted and and in addition to meat almost all of the internal organs of reindeer can be eaten some being traditional dishes furthermore lapin poron liha fresh reindeer meat completely produced and packed in finnish sapmi is protected in europe with pdo classificationreindeer antlers are powdered and sold as an aphrodisiac or as an nutritional or medicinal supplement to asian markets the blood of the caribou was supposedly mixed with alcohol as drink by hunters and loggers in colonial quebec to counter the cold this drink is now enjoyed without the blood as a wine and whiskey drink known as caribou reindeer and indigenous peoples wild reindeer are still hunted in greenland and in north america in the traditional lifestyle of the inuit people the northern first nations people the alaska natives and the kalaallit of greenland reindeer is an important source of food clothing shelter and tools the caribou inuit are inuit in nunavut keewatin region canada now known as the kivalliq region they subsisted on caribou eating dried caribou meat in the winter the ihalmiut are caribou inuit that followed the qamanirjuaq caribou herdthere is an inuit saying in the kivalliq region the caribou feeds the wolf but it is the wolf who keeps the caribou strong elder chief of koyukuk and chair for the western arctic caribou herd working group benedict jones or k ughto oodenool o represents the middle yukon river alaska his grandmother was a member of the caribou clan who travelled with the caribou as a means to survive in they were living the traditional life style at one of their hunting camps in koyukuk near the location of what is now the koyukuk national wildlife refuge his grandmother made a pair of new mukluks in one day k ughto oodenool o recounted a story told by an elder who worked on the steamboats during the gold rush days out on the yukon in late august the caribou migrated from the alaska range up north to huslia koyukuk and the tanana area one year when the steamboat was unable to continue they ran into a caribou herd numbering estimated at a million animals migrating across yukon they tied up for seven days waiting for the caribou to cross they ran out of wood for the steamboats and had to go back down miles to the wood pile to pick up some more wood on the tenth day they came back and they said there was still caribou going across the river night and day the the indigenous people of northwestern canada and northeastern alaska have been dependent on the international migratory porcupine caribou herd for millennia to them the cultural symbol and a keystone subsistence species of the just as the buffalo is to the plains indians innovative language revitalisation projects are underway to document the language and to enhance the writing and translation skills of younger speakers in one project lead research associate and fluent speaker gwich in elder kenneth frank works with linguists which include young speakers affiliated with the alaska native language center at the university of alaska in fairbanks to document traditional knowledge of caribou anatomy the main goal of the research was to elicit not only what the know about caribou anatomy but how they see caribou and what they say and believe about caribou that defines themselves their dietary and nutritional needs and their subsistence way of life elders have identified at least descriptive names for all of the bones organs and tissues associated with the caribou anatomy are not just descriptive names for all of the body parts including bones organs and tissues but also an encyclopedia of stories songs games toys ceremonies traditional tools skin clothing personal names and surnames and a highly developed ethnic cuisine in the traditional management practices were established to protect the porcupine caribou upon which the people depend they codified traditional principles of caribou management into tribal law which include limits on the harvest of caribou and procedures to be followed in processing and transporting caribou meat and limits on the number of caribou to be taken per hunting trip reindeer husbandry the reindeer is the only domesticated deer in the world though it may be more accurate to consider reindeer as reindeer in northern fennoscandia northern norway sweden and finland as well in the kola peninsula and yakutia in russia are all domestic reindeer rangifer tarandus f domesticus by their owners some reindeer in the area are truly domesticated mostly used as draught animals nowadays commonly for tourist entertainment and races traditionally important for the nomadic sami domesticated reindeer have also been used for milk eg in norway there are only two genetically pure populations of wild reindeer in
