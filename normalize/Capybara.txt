the capybara hydrochoerus hydrochaeris is a giant cavy rodent native to south america it is the largest living rodent in the world also called capivara in brazil chiguire chiguiro in colombia and venezuela carpincho in argentina paraguay and uruguay and ronsoco in peru it is a member of the genus hydrochoerus of which the only other extant member is the lesser capybara hydrochoerus isthmius its close relatives include guinea pigs and rock cavies and it is more distantly related to the agouti the chinchilla and the coypu the capybara inhabits savannas and dense forests and lives near bodies of water it is a highly social species and can be found in groups as large as individuals but usually lives in groups of individuals the capybara is not a threatened species but it is hunted for its meat and hide and also for grease from its thick fatty skin etymology its common name is derived from tupi a complex agglutination of kaa leaf pii slender u eat ara a suffix for agent nouns meaning one who eats slender leaves or capybaras were called several times cuartins in colombia in in eje cafetero alcala and near barranquilla where the meat was offered as cuartin asado the scientific name both hydrochoerus and hydrochaeris comes from greek udor hydor water and khoiros choiros pig hog classification and phylogeny the capybara and the lesser capybara belong to the subfamily hydrochoerinae along with the rock cavies the living capybaras and their extinct relatives were previously classified in their own family hydrochoeridae since molecular phylogenetic studies have recognized a close relationship between hydrochoerus and kerodon the rock cavies supporting placement of both genera in a subfamily of caviidaepaleontological classifications previously used hydrochoeridae for all capybaras while using hydrochoerinae for the living genus and its closest fossil relatives such as neochoerus but more recently have adopted the classification of hydrochoerinae within caviidae the taxonomy of fossil hydrochoerines is also in a state of flux in recent years the diversity of fossil hydrochoerines has been substantially reduced this is largely due to the recognition that capybara molar teeth show strong variation in shape over the life of an individual in one instance material once referred to four genera and seven species on the basis of differences in molar shape is now thought to represent differently aged individuals of a single species cardiatherium paranense among fossil species the name capybara can refer to the many species of hydrochoerinae that are more closely related to the modern hydrochoerus than to the cardiomyine rodents like cardiomys the fossil genera cardiatherium phugatherium hydrochoeropsis and neochoerus are all capybaras under that concept description the capybara has a heavy body and short head with fur on the upper part of its body that turns underneath its sweat glands can be found in the surface of the hairy portions of its skin an unusual trait among rodents the animal lacks down hair and its guard hair differs little from over hairadult capybaras grow to to cm to ft in length stand to cm to in tall at the withers and typically weigh to kg to lb with an average in the venezuelan llanos of kg lb females are slightly heavier than males the top recorded weights are kg lb for a wild female from brazil and kg lb for a wild male from uruguay also an kg individual was reported in sao paulo in or the dental formula is capybaras have slightly webbed feet and vestigial tails their hind legs are slightly longer than their forelegs they have three toes on their rear feet and four toes on their front feet their muzzles are blunt with nostrils and the eyes and ears are near the top of their heads its karyotype has and fn ecology capybaras are semiaquatic mammals found throughout almost all countries of south america except chile they live in densely forested areas near bodies of water such as lakes rivers swamps ponds and marshes as well as flooded savannah and along rivers in the tropical rainforest they are superb swimmers and can hold their breath underwater for up to five minutes at a time capybara have flourished in cattle ranches they roam in home ranges averaging hectares acres in populationsmany escapees from captivity can also be found in similar watery habitats around the world sightings are fairly common in florida although a breeding population has not yet been confirmed in one specimen was spotted on the central coast of california diet and predation capybaras are herbivores grazing mainly on grasses and aquatic plants as well as fruit and tree bark they are very selective feeders and feed on the leaves of one species and disregard other species surrounding it they eat a greater variety of plants during the dry season as fewer plants are available while they eat grass during the wet season they have to switch to more abundant reeds during the dry season plants that capybaras eat during the summer lose their nutritional value in the winter so are not consumed at that time the capybara jaw hinge is not perpendicular so they chew food by grinding rather than capybaras are autocoprophagous meaning they eat their own feces as a source of bacterial gut flora to help digest the cellulose in the grass that forms their normal diet and to extract the maximum protein and vitamins from their food they may also regurgitate food to masticate again similar to by cattle as is the case with other rodents the front teeth of capybaras grow continually to compensate for the constant wear from eating grasses their cheek teeth also grow continuouslylike its relative the guinea pig the capybara does not have the capacity to synthesize vitamin c and capybaras not supplemented with vitamin c in captivity have been reported to develop gum disease as a sign of scurvythey can have a lifespan of years but live less than four years in the wild because they are a favourite food of jaguar puma ocelot eagle and caiman the capybara is also the preferred prey of the anaconda social organization capybaras are known to be gregarious while they sometimes live solitarily they are more commonly found in groups of around individuals with two to four adult males four to seven adult females and the remainder juveniles capybara groups can consist of as many as or individuals during the dry season when the animals gather around available water sources males establish social bonds dominance or general group consensus they can make barks when threatened or when females are herding youngcapybaras have two types of scent glands a morrillo located on the snout and anal glands both sexes have these glands but males have much larger morrillos and use their anal glands more frequently the anal glands of males are also lined with detachable hairs a crystalline form of scent secretion is coated on these hairs and is released when in contact with objects such as plants these hairs have a scent mark and are tasted by other capybaras capybaras by rubbing their morrillos on objects or by walking over scrub and marking it with their anal glands capybaras can spread their scent further by urinating however females usually mark without urinating and less frequently than males overall females mark more often during the wet season when they are in estrus in addition to objects males also females reproduction when in estrus the female scent changes subtly and nearby males begin pursuit in addition a female alerts males she is in estrus by whistling through her nose during mating the female has the advantage and mating choice capybaras mate only in water and if a female does not want to mate with a certain male she either submerges or leaves the water dominant males are highly protective of the females but they usually can not prevent some of the subordinates from copulating the larger the group the harder it is for the male to watch all the females dominant males secure significantly more matings than each subordinate but subordinate males as a class are responsible for more matings than each dominant male the lifespan of the capybara sperm is longer than that of other rodents capybara gestation is days and produces a litter of four capybaras young on average but may produce between one and eight in a single litter birth is on land and the female rejoins the group within a few hours of delivering the newborn capybaras which join the group as soon as they are mobile within a week the young can eat grass but continue to any female in the weaned around weeks the young form a group within the main group alloparenting has been observed in this species breeding peaks between april and may in venezuela and between october and november in mato grosso brazil activities though quite agile on land capybaras are equally at home in the water they are excellent swimmers and can remain completely submerged for up to five minutes an ability they use to evade predators capybaras can sleep in water keeping only their noses out of the water as temperatures increase during the day they wallow in water and then graze during the late afternoon and early evening they also spend time wallowing in mud they rest around midnight and then continue to graze before dawn conservation and human interaction capybaras are not considered a threatened species their population is stable throughout most of their south american range though in some areas hunting has reduced their numberscapybaras are hunted for their meat and pelts in some areas and otherwise killed by humans who see their grazing as competition for livestock in some areas they are farmed which has the effect of ensuring the wetland habitats are protected their survival is aided by their ability to breed rapidlycapybaras have adapted well to urbanization in south america they can be found in many areas in zoos and parks and may live for years in captivity more than double their natural lifespan capybaras are docile and usually allow humans to pet and them but physical contact is normally discouraged as their ticks can be vectors to rocky mountain spotted feverthe european association of zoos and aquaria asked drusillas park in alfriston sussex england to keep the studbook for capybaras to monitor captive populations in europe the studbook includes information about all births deaths and movements of capybaras as well as how they are relatedcapybaras are farmed for meat and skins in south america the meat is considered unsuitable to eat in some areas while in other areas it is considered an important source of protein in parts of south america especially in venezuela capybara meat is popular during lent and holy week as the catholic church previously issued special dispensation to allow it to be eaten while other meats are generally forbidden there is widespread perception in venezuela that consumption of capybaras is exclusive to rural peoplealthough it is illegal in some states capybaras are occasionally kept as pets in the united states the image of a capybara features on the coin of uruguayin japan following the lead of izu shaboten park in multiple establishments or zoos in japan that raise capybaras have adopted the practice of having them relax in onsen during the winter they are seen as an attraction by japanese people capybaras became big in japan due to the popular cartoon character borreliosis likely involves capybaras as reservoirs and amblyomma and
