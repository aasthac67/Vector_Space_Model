foxes are small to omnivorous mammals belonging to several genera of the family canidae foxes have a flattened skull upright triangular ears a pointed slightly upturned snout and a long bushy tail or brush twelve species belong to the monophyletic true foxes group of genus vulpes approximately another current or extinct species are always or sometimes called foxes these foxes are either part of the paraphyletic group of the south american foxes or of the outlying group which consists of the fox gray fox and island fox foxes live on every continent except antarctica by far the most common and widespread species of fox is the red fox vulpes vulpes with about recognized subspecies the global distribution of foxes together with their widespread reputation for cunning has contributed to their prominence in popular culture and folklore in many societies around the world the hunting of foxes with packs of hounds long an established pursuit in europe especially in the british isles was exported by european settlers to various parts of the new world etymology the word fox comes from old english which derived from fuhsaz this in turn derives from meaning tail male foxes are known as dogs tods or reynards females as vixens and young as cubs pups or kits though the latter name is not to be confused with a distinct species called kit foxes vixen is one of very few words in modern english that retains the middle english southern dialect v pronunciation instead of f ie northern english fox versus southern english vox a group of foxes is referred to as a skulk leash or earth phylogenetic relationships within the canidae the results of dna analysis shows several phylogenetic divisions the canids which include the kit fox vulpes velox red fox vulpes vulpes cape fox vulpes chama arctic fox vulpes lagopus and fennec fox vulpes zerda the canids genus canis cuon and lycaon including the dog canis lupus familiaris gray wolf canis lupus red wolf canis rufus eastern wolf canis lycaon coyote canis latrans golden jackal canis aureus ethiopian wolf canis simensis jackal canis mesomelas jackal canis adustus dhole cuon alpinus and african wild dog lycaon pictus the south american canids including the bush dog speothos venaticus hoary fox lycalopex uetulus fox cerdocyon thous and maned wolf chrysocyon brachyurus various monotypic taxa including the fox otocyon megalotis gray fox urocyon cinereoargenteus and raccoon dog nyctereutes procyonoides biology general morphology foxes are generally smaller than some other members of the family canidae such as wolves and jackals while they may be larger than some within the family such as raccoon dogs in the largest species the red fox males weigh on average between and kilograms and pounds while the smallest species the fennec fox weighs just to kg to lb foxy features typically include a triangular face pointed ears an elongated rostrum and a bushy tail foxes are digitigrade they walk on their toes unlike most members of the family canidae foxes have partially retractable claws fox vibrissae or whiskers are black the whiskers on the muzzle mystaciae vibrissae average millimetres inches long while the whiskers everywhere else on the head average to be shorter in length whiskers carpal vibrissae are also on the forelimbs and average mm in long pointing downward and backward other physical characteristics vary according to habitat and adaptive significance pelage fox species differ in fur color length and density coat colors range from pearly white to to black flecked with white or grey on the underside fennec foxes and other species of fox adapted to life in the desert such as kit foxes for example have large ears and short fur to aid in keeping the body cool arctic foxes on the other hand have tiny ears and short limbs as well as thick insulating fur which aid in keeping the body warm red foxes by contrast have a typical auburn pelt the tail normally ending with a white marking a fox coat color and texture may vary due to the change in seasons fox pelts are richer and denser in the colder months and lighter in the warmer months to get rid of the dense winter coat foxes moult once a year around april the process begins from the feet up the legs and then along the back coat color may also change as the individual ages dentition a fox dentition like all other canids is i c pm m foxes have six extra molars totalling in teeth foxes have pronounced carnassial pairs which is characteristic of a carnivore these pairs consist of the upper premolar and the lower first molar and work together to shear tough material like flesh foxes canines are pronounced also characteristic of a carnivore and are excellent in gripping prey behaviour in the wild the typical lifespan of a fox is one to three years although individuals may live up to ten years unlike many canids foxes are not always pack animals typically they live in small family groups but some such as arctic foxes are known to be solitaryfoxes are omnivores their diet is made up primarily of invertebrates such as insects and small vertebrates such as reptiles and birds they may also eat eggs and vegetation many species are generalist predators but some such as the fox have more specialized diets most species of fox consume around kg lb of food every day foxes cache excess food burying it for later consumption usually under leaves snow or soil while hunting foxes tend to use a particular pouncing technique such that they crouch down to camouflage themselves in the terrain and then use their hind legs to leap up with great force and land on top of their chosen prey using their pronounced canine teeth they can then grip the prey neck and shake it until it is dead or can be readily disemboweledthe gray fox is one of only two canine species known to regularly climb trees the other is the raccoon dog sexual characteristics the male fox scrotum is held up close to the body with the testes inside even after they descend like other canines the male fox has a baculum or penile bone the testes of red foxes are smaller than those of arctic foxes sperm formation in red foxes begins in with the testicles attaining their greatest weight in are in heat for one to six days making their reproductive cycle twelve months long as with other canines the ova are shed during estrus without the need for the stimulation of copulating once the egg is fertilized the vixen enters a period of gestation that can last from to days foxes tend to have an average litter size of four to five with an percent success rate in becoming pregnant litter sizes can vary greatly according to species and environment the arctic fox for example can have up to eleven kitsthe vixen usually has six or eight mammae each teat has to lactiferous ducts which connect the mammary gland to the nipple allowing for milk to be carried to the nipple vocalization the fox vocal repertoire is vast whine made shortly after birth occurs at a high rate when kits are hungry and when their body temperatures are low whining stimulates the mother to care for her young it also has been known to stimulate the male fox into caring for his mate and kits yelp made about days later the kits whining turns into infantile barks yelps which occur heavily during play explosive call at the age of about one month the kits can emit an explosive call which is intended to be threatening to intruders or other cubs a howl combative call in adults the explosive call becomes an combative call during any conflict a sharper bark growl an adult fox indication to their kits to feed or head to the adult location bark adult foxes warn against intruders and in defense by barkingin the case of domesticated foxes the whining seems to remain in adult individuals as a sign of excitement and submission in the presence of their owners classification canids commonly known as foxes include the following genera and species conservation several fox species are endangered in their native environments pressures placed on foxes include habitat loss and being hunted for pelts other trade or control due in part to their opportunistic hunting style and industriousness foxes are commonly resented as nuisance animals on the other hand foxes while often considered pests themselves have been successfully employed to control pests on fruit farms while leaving the fruit intact island fox urocyon littoralis the island fox though considered a species throughout the world is becoming increasingly endangered in its endemic environment of the california channel islands a population on an island is smaller than those on the mainland because of limited resources like space food and shelter island populations therefore are highly susceptible to external threats ranging from introduced predatory species and humans to extreme weather on the california channel islands it was found that the population of the island fox was so low due to an outbreak of canine distemper virus from to as well as predation by golden eagles since the eagles have caused the population to decline by as much as because of the low number of foxes the population went through an allee effect this is where at low enough densities an individual fitness decreases conservationists therefore had to take healthy breeding pairs out of the wild population to breed them in captivity until they had enough foxes to release back into the wild nonnative grazers were also removed so that native plants would be able to grow back to their natural height thereby providing adequate cover and protection for the foxes against golden eagles darwin fox pseudalopex fulvipes darwin fox is considered critically endangered because of their small known population of mature individuals as well as their restricted distribution on the chilean mainland the population is limited to nahuelbuta national park and the surrounding valdivian rainforest similarly on chiloe island their population is limited to the forests that extend from the southernmost to the northwestern most part of the island though the nahuelbuta national park is protected of the species live on chiloe island a major problem the species faces therefore is their dwindling limited habitat due to the cutting and burning of the unprotected forests because of deforestation the darwin fox habitat is shrinking allowing for their competitor chilla fox preferred habitat of open space to increase the darwin fox subsequently is being outcompeted another problem they face is their inability to fight off diseases transmitted by the increasing number of pet dogs to conserve these animals researchers suggest the need for the forests that link the nahuelbuta national park to the coast of chile and in turn chiloe island and its forests to be protected they also suggest that other forests around chile be examined to determine whether darwin foxes have previously existed there or can live there in the future should the need to reintroduce the species to those areas arise and finally the researchers advise for the creation of a captive breeding program in chile because of the limited number of mature individuals in the wild relationships with humans foxes are often considered pests or nuisance creatures for their opportunistic attacks on poultry and other small livestock fox attacks on humans are not common many foxes adapt well to human environments with several species classified as resident urban carnivores for their ability to sustain populations entirely within urban boundaries foxes in urban areas can live longer and can have smaller litter sizes than foxes in areas urban foxes are ubiquitous in europe where they show altered behaviors compared to foxes including increased population density smaller territory and pack foraging foxes have been introduced in numerous locations with varying effects on indigenous flora and faunain some countries foxes are major predators of rabbits and hens population oscillations of these two species were the first nonlinear oscillation studied and led to the derivation of the equation fox hunting fox hunting originated in the united kingdom in the century hunting with dogs is now banned in the united kingdom though hunting without dogs is still permitted red foxes were introduced into australia in the early century for sport and have since become widespread through much of the country they have caused population decline among many native species and prey on livestock especially new lambs fox hunting is practiced as recreation in several other countries including canada france ireland italy russia united states and australia domestication there are many records of domesticated red foxes and others but rarely of sustained domestication a recent and notable exception is the russian silver fox which resulted in visible and behavioral changes and is a case study of an animal population modeling according to human domestication needs the current group of domesticated silver foxes are the result of nearly fifty years of experiments in the soviet union and russia to domesticate the silver morph of the red fox this selective breeding resulted in physical and behavioral traits appearing that are frequently seen in domestic cats dogs and other animals such as pigmentation changes floppy ears and curly tails notably the new foxes became more tame allowing themselves to be petted whimpering to get attention and sniffing and licking their caretakers attacks on humans in the united kingdom a number of cases of attacks on humans have been reported they often involved children or if there were gaps in homes through which foxes could pass urban foxes foxes are among the comparatively few mammals which have been able to adapt themselves to a certain degree to living in urban mostly suburban human environments their omnivorous diet allows them to survive on discarded food waste and their skittish and often nocturnal nature means that they are often able to avoid detection despite their larger size urban foxes however have been identified as threats to cats and small dogs and for this reason there is often pressure to exclude them from these environmentsthe san joaquin kit fox is a highly endangered species that has ironically become adapted to urban living in the san joaquin valley and salinas valley of southern california its diet includes mice ground squirrels rabbits hares bird eggs and insects and it has claimed habitats in open areas golf courses drainage basins and school grounds in culture the fox appears in many cultures usually in folklore however there are slight variations in their depictions in folklore in western folklore and also in persian folklore foxes are depicted as a symbol of cunning and trickery a reputation derived especially from their reputed ability to evade hunters this is usually represented as a character possessing these traits these traits are used on a wide variety of characters either making them a nuisance to the story a misunderstood hero or a devious villain in asian folklore foxes are depicted as a familiar spirit possessed of magic powers similar to western folklore foxes are depicted as mischievous usually tricking other people with the ability to disguise as an attractive female human however there are other depictions of foxes as a mystical sacred creature that can either bring wonder or ruin foxes appear in chinese folklore literature and mythology in which depending on the tale can be a good or a bad omen the motif was eventually introduced from chinese to japanese and korean culturesthe constellation vulpecula represents a fox notes references external links bbc wales
