the gaur bos gaurus also called the indian bison is native to south and southeast asia and has been listed as vulnerable on the iucn red list since the global population has been estimated at maximum mature individuals by it declined by more than during the last three generations and is extinct in sri lanka and probably also in bangladesh in areas it is stable and increasingit is the largest species among the wild cattle in malaysia it is called seladang and pyaung in myanmar the domesticated form of the gaur is called gayal bos frontalis or mithun characteristics the gaur is a strong and massively built bovid with a high convex ridge on the forehead between the horns which protrudes anteriorly causing a deep hollow in the profile of the upper part of the head there is a prominent ridge on the back the ears are very large the tail only just reaches the hocks and in old bulls the hair becomes very thin on the back the adult male is dark brown approaching black in very old individuals the upper part of the head from above the eyes to the nape of the neck is ashy grey or occasionally dirty white the muzzle is pale coloured and the lower part of the legs are pure white or tan the cows and young bulls are paler and in some instances have a rufous tinge which is most marked in groups inhabiting dry and open areas the tail is shorter than in the typical oxen reaching only to the hocks they have a distinct ridge running from the shoulders to the middle of the back the shoulders may be as much as cm in higher than the rump this ridge is caused by the great length of the spinous processes of the vertebrae of the of the trunk as compared with those of the loins the hair is short fine and glossy the hooves are narrow and pointedthe gaur does not have a distinct dewlap on the throat and chest both sexes have horns which grow from the sides of the head curving upwards between the horns is a high convex ridge on the forehead at their bases they present an elliptical a characteristic that is more strongly marked in bulls than in cows the horns are decidedly flattened at the base and regularly curved throughout their length and are bent inward and slightly backward at their tips the colour of the horns is some shade of pale green or yellow throughout the greater part of their length but the tips are black the horns of medium size by large bovid standards grow to a length of to cm to in the cow is considerably lighter in colour than the bull her horns are more slender and upright with more inward curvature and the frontal ridge is scarcely perceptible in young animals the horns are smooth and polished in old bulls they are rugged and dented at the basethe gaur is the largest wild bovid alive today it has a length of to cm ft in to ft in with a to cm to in long tail and is to cm ft in to ft in high at the shoulder averaging about cm ft in in females and cm ft in in males at the top of its muscular hump just behind its shoulder an average adult male is just under cm ft in tall and the male girth at its midsection behind its shoulders averages about cm ft in males are about larger and heavier than females body mass ranges widely from to kg to lb in adult females and to kg to lb in adult males in general measurements are derived from gaurs surveyed in india indian gaur males averaged about kg lb in a sample of and females weigh a median of approximately kg lb in china the shoulder height of gaurs ranges from cm in and males weigh up to kg lb the seladang or malayasian subspecies b g hubbacki appears to be larger on average than the nominate race from india but sample sizes as known are small according to some sources seladang bulls weigh on average to kg to lb which if accurate indicates these animals are on average more than more massive than the gaurs of india distribution and habitat gaur historically occurred throughout mainland south and southeast asia including vietnam cambodia laos thailand peninsular malaysia myanmar india bangladesh bhutan china and nepal today the range of the species is seriously fragmented and it is regionally extinct in sri lankagaur are largely confined to evergreen forests or and moist deciduous forests but also occur in deciduous forest areas at the periphery of their range gaur habitat is characterized by large relatively undisturbed forest tracts hilly terrain below an altitude of to m to ft availability of water and an abundance of forage in the form of grasses bamboo shrubs and trees their apparent preference for hilly terrain may be partly due to the earlier conversion of most of the plains and other areas to croplands and pastures they occur from sea level to an altitude of at least m ft areas seem to comprise optimal habitatin nepal the gaur population was estimated to be in the with the majority in chitwan national park and the adjacent parsa national park these two parks are connected by a chain of forested hills population trends appeared to be relatively stable the chitwan population has increased from to animals in the years to census conducted in parsa national park confirmed the presence of gaur in the same periodin india the population was estimated to be in the the western ghats and their outflanking hills in southern india constitute one of the most extensive extant strongholds of gaur in particular in the wayanad nagarhole mudumalai bandipur complex the populations in india bhutan and bangladesh are estimated to comprise individuals major populations of about individuals have been reported in both nagarahole and bandipur national parks over individuals in tadoba andhari tiger project individuals in both periyar tiger reserve and silent valley and adjoining forest complexes and over individuals in bhadra wildlife sanctuaryin bhutan they apparently persist all over the southern foothill zone notably in royal manas national park phibsoo wildlife sanctuary and khaling wildlife sanctuaryin bangladesh a few gaur occur in the chittagong hill tracts mostly in banderban district during a camera trap project few gaur were recorded indicating that the population is fragmented and probably declining gaurs are hunted by local tribal people in sangu matamuhari reserve forest although hunting is prohibited in bangladeshin thailand gaur were once found throughout the country but fewer than individuals were estimated to have remained in the in the mostly dong phayayen khao yai forest complex they were recorded at low density at the turn of the century with an estimated total of about individualsin vietnam several areas in dak lak province were known to contain gaur in several herds persist in cat tien national park and in adjacent state forest enterprises the current status of the gaur population is poorly known they may be in serious declinein cambodia gaur declined considerably in the period from the late to the early the most substantial population of the country remained in mondulkiri province where up to individuals may have survived in a forested landscape of over sq mi results of camera trapping carried out in suggested a globally significant population of gaur in the mondulkiri protected forest and the contiguous phnom prich wildlife sanctuaryin laos up to individuals were estimated to inhabit protected area boundaries in the they were reported discontinuously distributed in low numbers overhunting had reduced the population and survivors occurred mainly in remote sites fewer than six national biodiversity conservation areas held more than individuals areas with populations likely to be nationally important included the nam theun catchment and the adjoining plateau subsequent surveys carried out a decade later using fairly intensive camera trapping did not record any gaur any more indicating a massive decline of the populationin china gaur occur in heavily fragmented populations in yunnan and southeastern tibet by the they were extirpated in lancang county and the remaining animals were split into two populations viz in and cangyuan in the a population of individuals may have lived in yunnan province with the majority occurring in xishuangbanna national nature reserve ecology and behaviour where gaur have not been disturbed they are basically diurnal in other areas they have become largely nocturnal due to human impact on the forest in central india they are most active at night and are rarely seen in the open after in the morning during the dry season herds congregate and remain in small areas dispersing into the hills with the arrival of the monsoon while gaur depend on water for drinking they do not seem to bathe or wallowin january and february gaur live in small herds of eight to individuals one of which is a bull in april or may more bulls may join the herd for mating and individual bulls may move from herd to herd each mating with many cows in may or june they leave the herd and may form herds of bulls only or live alone herds wander km mi each day each herd has a nonexclusive home range and sometimes herds may join in groups of or moregaur herds are led by an old adult female the matriarch adult males may be solitary during the peak of the breeding season unattached males wander widely in search of receptive females no serious fighting between males has been recorded with size being the major factor in determining dominance males make a mating call of clear resonant tones which may carry for more than km mi gaur have also been known to make a whistling snort as an alarm call and a low mooin some regions in india where human disturbance is minor the gaur is very timid and shy despite their great size and power when alarmed gaur crash into the jungle at a surprising speed however in southeast asia and south india where they are used to the presence of humans gaur are said by locals to be very bold and aggressive they are frequently known to go into fields and graze alongside domestic cattle sometimes killing them in fights gaur bulls may charge without provocation especially during summer when the intense heat and parasitic insects make them more than usual to warn other members of its herd of approaching danger the gaur lets out a high whistle for help feeding ecology wild gaur graze and browse on a wider variety of plants than any other ungulate species of india with a preference for the upper portions of plants such as leaf blades stems seeds and flowers of grass species including kadamduring a survey in the bhagwan mahaveer sanctuary and mollem national park species of plants were identified as food for gaur they consume herbs young shoots flowers fruits of elephant apple dillenia ssp with a high preference for leaves food preference varies by season in winter and monsoon they feed on preferably fine and fresh grasses and herb species of the legume family such as tick clover desmodium triflorum but also browse on leaves of shrub species such as karvy strobilanthes callosus indian boxwood gardenia latifolia crossberry grewia abutifolia screw tree helicteres ssp and the chaste tree vitex negundo in summer they also feed on bark of teak tectona grandis on fruit of golden shower tree cassia fistula and on the bark and fruit of cashew anacardium occidentale gaur spent most of their daily time feeding peak feeding activity was observed between and am and between and pm during the hottest hours of the day to pm they rest in the shade of big treesthey may debark trees due to shortages of preferred food and of minerals and trace elements needed for their nutrition or for maintaining an optimum ratio for proper digestion of food and better assimilation of nutrients they may turn to available browse species and fibrous teak bark in summer as green grass and herbaceous resources dry up high concentrations of calcium ppm and phosphorus ppm have been reported in teak bark so consumption of teak bark may help animals to satisfy both mineral and other food needs survival and conservation of these herbivores depend on the availability of preferred plant species for food hence protection of the historically preferred habitats used by gaur is a significant factor in conservation biology reproduction sexual maturity occurs in the gaur second or third year females have one calf rarely two after a gestation period of about days a few days less than domestic cattle calves are typically weaned after seven to months breeding takes place but typically peaks between december and june the lifespan of a gaur in captivity is up to years natural predators due to their formidable size and power gaur have few natural predators besides humans leopards dhole packs and large mugger crocodiles occasionally attack unguarded calves or unhealthy animals only tigers and saltwater crocodiles have been reported to kill adult gaur however the habitat and distribution of gaur and saltwater crocodiles seldom overlap in recent times due to the decreasing range of both species a crocodile likely would need to be a mature adult male more than m ft and kg lb to make a successful attack on healthy adult gaurstigers hunt young or infirm gaur but have also been reported to have killed healthy bulls weighing at least kg lb a video of a tiger killing a female gaur was recorded in the bandipur tiger reserve in october when confronted by a tiger the adult members of a gaur herd often form a circle surrounding the vulnerable young and calves shielding them from the big cat as tigers rely on ambush attacks when taking on prey as large as a gaur they will almost always abandon a hunt if detected and met in this manner a herd of gaur in malaysia encircled a calf killed by a tiger and prevented it from approaching the carcass gaurs are capable of chasing off and killing tigers in an old tigress in navegaon nagzira tiger reserve appears to have died after being wounded by a gaurgaur are not as aggressive toward humans as wild water buffaloes threats in laos gaurs are highly threatened by poaching for trade to supply international markets but also by opportunistic hunting and specific hunting for home consumption in the they were particularly sought by vietnamese poachers for their commercial valuein thailand gaurs are highly threatened by poaching for commercial trade in meat and trophies conservation bos gaurus is listed in cites appendix i and is legally protected in all range states cryoconservation of animal genetic resources have been put into place in order to help reinforce the gaur population in captivity on january the first cloned gaur was born at trans ova genetics in sioux center iowa the calf was carried and brought successfully to term by a surrogate mother a domestic cow bos taurus while healthy at birth the calf died within hours of a common dysentery most likely unrelated to cloning taxonomy bison gaurus was the scientific name proposed by charles hamilton smith in later authors subordinated the species under either bos or bibosin the international commission on zoological nomenclature has fixed the first available specific name based on a wild population that the name for this wild species is valid by virtue of its being antedated by a name based on a domestic form most authors have adopted the binomial bos gaurus for the wild species as valid for the taxontraditionally three gaur subspecies have been recognized b g gaurus ranges in india nepal and bhutan b g readei described by richard lydekker in based on a specimen from myanmar is thought to range from upper myanmar to tanintharyi region b g hubbacki described by lydekker in based on a specimen from pahang in peninsular malaysia it was considered to range in peninsular malaysia and probably northward to tenasserim this classification based largely on differences in coloration and size is no longer widely recognizedin recognition of phenotypic differences between indian and southeast asian specimens the trinominals bos gaurus gaurus and bos gaurus laosiensis are provisionally accepted pending further morphometric and genetic study etymology the sanskrit word gaura means white yellowish reddish the
