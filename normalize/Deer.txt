the common name deer has the hoofed ruminant mammal forming the family cervidae the two main groups of deer are the cervinae including the muntjac the elk wapiti the fallow deer and the chital and the capreolinae including the reindeer caribou the roe deer and the moose female reindeer and male deer of all species except the chinese water deer grow and shed new antlers each year in this they differ from permanently horned antelope which are part of a different family bovidae within the same order of ungulates artiodactyla the musk deer moschidae of asia and chevrotains tragulidae of tropical african and asian forests are separate families within the ruminant clade ruminantia they are not especially closely related to deer among the ruminantia deer appear in art from paleolithic cave paintings onwards and they have played a role in mythology religion and literature throughout history as well as in heraldry their economic importance includes the use of their meat as venison their skins as soft strong buckskin and their antlers as handles for knives deer hunting has been a popular activity since at least the middle ages and remains a resource for many families today distribution deer live in a variety of biomes ranging from tundra to the tropical rainforest while often associated with forests many deer are ecotone species that live in transitional areas between forests and thickets for cover and prairie and savanna open space the majority of large deer species inhabit temperate mixed deciduous forest mountain mixed coniferous forest tropical forest and savanna habitats around the world clearing open areas within forests to some extent may actually benefit deer populations by exposing the understory and allowing the types of grasses weeds and herbs to grow that deer like to eat additionally access to adjacent croplands may also benefit deer however adequate forest or brush cover must still be provided for populations to grow and thrive deer are widely distributed with indigenous representatives in all continents except antarctica and australia though africa has only one native deer the barbary stag a subspecies of red deer that is confined to the atlas mountains in the northwest of the continent an additional extinct species of deer megaceroides algericus was present in north africa until years ago fallow deer have been introduced to south africa small species of brocket deer and pudus of central and south america and muntjacs of asia generally occupy dense forests and are less often seen in open spaces with the possible exception of the indian muntjac there are also several species of deer that are highly specialized and live almost exclusively in mountains grasslands swamps and wet savannas or riparian corridors surrounded by deserts some deer have a circumpolar distribution in both north america and eurasia examples include the caribou that live in arctic tundra and taiga boreal forests and moose that inhabit taiga and adjacent areas huemul deer taruca and chilean huemul of south america andes fill the ecological niches of the ibex and wild goat with the fawns behaving more like goat kids the highest concentration of large deer species in temperate north america lies in the canadian rocky mountain and columbia mountain regions between alberta and british columbia where all five north american deer species deer mule deer caribou elk and moose can be found this region has several clusters of national parks including mount revelstoke national park glacier national park canada yoho national park and kootenay national park on the british columbia side and banff national park jasper national park and glacier national park us on the alberta and montana sides mountain slope habitats vary from moist forested habitats to dry forests with alpine meadows higher up the foothills and river valleys between the mountain ranges provide a mosaic of cropland and deciduous parklands the rare woodland caribou have the most restricted range living at higher altitudes in the subalpine meadows and alpine tundra areas of some of the mountain ranges elk and mule deer both migrate between the alpine meadows and lower coniferous forests and tend to be most common in this region elk also inhabit river valley bottomlands which they share with deer the deer have recently expanded their range within the foothills and river valley bottoms of the canadian rockies owing to conversion of land to cropland and the clearing of coniferous forests allowing more deciduous vegetation to grow up the mountain slopes they also live in the aspen parklands north of calgary and edmonton where they share habitat with the moose the adjacent great plains grassland habitats are left to herds of elk american bison and pronghorn the eurasian continent including the indian subcontinent boasts the most species of deer in the world with most species being found in asia europe in comparison has lower diversity in plant and animal species however many national parks and protected reserves in europe do have populations of red deer roe deer and fallow deer these species have long been associated with the continent of europe but also inhabit asia minor the caucasus mountains and northwestern iran european fallow deer historically lived over much of europe during the ice ages but afterwards became restricted primarily to the anatolian peninsula in turkey fallow deer populations in europe are a result of historic introductions of this species first to the mediterranean regions of europe then eventually to the rest of europe they were initially park animals that later escaped and reestablished themselves in the wild historically europe deer species shared their deciduous forest habitat with other herbivores such as the extinct tarpan forest horse extinct aurochs forest ox and the endangered wisent european bison good places to see deer in europe include the scottish highlands the austrian alps the wetlands between austria hungary and the czech republic and some fine national parks including donana national park in spain the veluwe in the netherlands the ardennes in belgium and bialowieza national park of poland spain eastern europe and the caucasus mountains still have virgin forest areas that are not only home to sizable deer populations but also for other animals that were once abundant such as the wisent eurasian lynx iberian lynx wolves and brown bears the highest concentration of large deer species in temperate asia occurs in the mixed deciduous forests mountain coniferous forests and taiga bordering north korea manchuria northeastern china and the ussuri region russia these are among some of the richest deciduous and coniferous forests in the world where one can find siberian roe deer sika deer elk and moose asian caribou occupy the northern fringes of this region along the border deer such as the sika deer thorold deer central asian red deer and elk have historically been farmed for their antlers by han chinese turkic peoples tungusic peoples mongolians and koreans like the sami people of finland and scandinavia the tungusic peoples mongolians and turkic peoples of southern siberia northern mongolia and the ussuri region have also taken to raising herds of asian caribou the highest concentration of large deer species in the tropics occurs in southern asia in india plain region and nepal terai region these fertile plains consist of tropical seasonal moist deciduous dry deciduous forests and both dry and wet savannas that are home to chital hog deer barasingha indian sambar and indian muntjac grazing species such as the endangered barasingha and very common chital are gregarious and live in large herds indian sambar can be gregarious but are usually solitary or live in smaller herds hog deer are solitary and have lower densities than indian muntjac deer can be seen in several national parks in india nepal and sri lanka of which kanha national park dudhwa national park and chitwan national park are most famous sri lanka wilpattu national park and yala national park have large herds of indian sambar and chital the indian sambar are more gregarious in sri lanka than other parts of their range and tend to form larger herds than elsewhere the chao praya river valley of thailand was once primarily tropical seasonal moist deciduous forest and wet savanna that hosted populations of hog deer the schomburgk deer eld deer indian sambar and indian muntjac both the hog deer and eld deer are rare whereas indian sambar and indian muntjac thrive in protected national parks such as khao yai many of these south asian and southeast asian deer species also share their habitat with other herbivores such as asian elephants the various asian rhinoceros species various antelope species such as nilgai antelope blackbuck and indian gazelle in india and wild oxen such as wild asian water buffalo gaur banteng and kouprey one way that different herbivores can survive together in a given area is for each species to have different food preferences although there may be some overlap australia has six introduced species of deer that have established sustainable wild populations from acclimatisation society releases in the century these are the fallow deer red deer sambar hog deer rusa and chital red deer introduced into new zealand in from english and scottish stock were domesticated in deer farms by the late and are common farm animals there now seven other species of deer were introduced into new zealand but none are as widespread as red deer description deer constitute the second most diverse family of artiodactyla after bovids though of a similar build deer are strongly distinguished from antelopes by their antlers which are temporary and regularly regrown unlike the permanent horns of bovids characteristics typical of deer include long powerful legs a diminutive tail and long ears deer exhibit a broad variation in physical proportions the largest extant deer is the moose which is nearly metres ft tall and weighs up to kilograms lb the elk stands metres ft at the shoulder and weighs kilograms lb the northern pudu is the smallest deer in the world it reaches merely centimetres in at the shoulder and weighs kilograms lb the southern pudu is only slightly taller and heavier sexual dimorphism is quite pronounced in most species males tend to be larger than females and except for the reindeer only males possess antlerscoat colour generally varies between red and brown though it can be as dark as chocolate brown in the tufted deer or have a grayish tinge as in elk different species of brocket deer vary from gray to reddish brown in coat colour several species such as the chital the fallow deer and the sika deer feature white spots on a brown coat coat of reindeer shows notable geographical variation deer undergo two moults in a year for instance in red deer the red summer coat is gradually replaced by the dense greyish brown winter coat in autumn which in turn gives way to the summer coat in the following spring moulting is affected by the photoperioddeer are also excellent jumpers and swimmers deer are ruminants or and have a stomach some deer such as those on the island of rum do consume meat when it is available nearly all deer have a facial gland in front of each eye the gland contains a strongly scented pheromone used to mark its home range bucks of a wide range of species open these glands wide when angry or excited all deer have a liver without a gallbladder deer also have a tapetum lucidum which gives them sufficiently good night vision antlers all male deer possess antlers with the exception of the water deer in which males have long canines that reach below the lower jaw females generally lack antlers though female reindeer bear antlers smaller and less branched than those of the males occasionally females in other species may develop antlers especially in telemetacarpal deer such as european roe deer red deer deer and mule deer and less often in plesiometacarpal deer a study of antlered female deer noted that antlers tend to be small and malformed and are shed frequently around the time of parturitionthe fallow deer and the various subspecies of the reindeer have the largest as well as the heaviest antlers both in absolute terms as well as in proportion to body mass an average of grams oz per kilogram of body mass the tufted deer on the other hand has the smallest antlers of all deer while the pudu has the lightest antlers with respect to body mass grams oz per kilogram of body mass the structure of antlers show considerable variation while fallow deer and elk antlers are palmate with a broad central portion deer antlers include a series of tines sprouting upward from a main beam and those of the pudu are mere spikes antler development begins from the pedicel a bony structure that appears on the top of the skull by the time the animal is a year old the pedicel gives rise to a spiky antler the following year that is replaced by a branched antler in the third year this process of losing a set of antlers to develop a larger and more branched set continues for the rest of the life the antlers emerge as soft tissues known as velvet antlers and progressively harden into bony structures known as hard antlers following mineralisation and blockage of blood vessels in the tissue from the tip to the baseantlers might be one of the most exaggerated male secondary sexual characteristics and are intended primarily for reproductive success through sexual selection and for combat the tines forks on the antlers create grooves that allow another male antlers to lock into place this allows the males to wrestle without risking injury to the face antlers are correlated to an individual position in the social hierarchy and its behaviour for instance the heavier the antlers the higher the individual status in the social hierarchy and the greater the delay in shedding the antlers males with larger antlers tend to be more aggressive and dominant over others antlers can be an honest signal of genetic quality males with larger antlers relative to body size tend to have increased resistance to pathogens and higher reproductive capacityin elk in yellowstone national park antlers also provide protection against predation by wolves teeth most deer bear teeth the corresponding dental formula is the elk and the reindeer may be exceptions as they may retain their upper canines and thus have teeth dental formula the chinese water deer tufted deer and muntjac have enlarged upper canine teeth forming sharp tusks while other species often lack upper canines altogether the cheek teeth of deer have crescent ridges of enamel which enable them to grind a wide variety of vegetation the teeth of deer are adapted to feeding on vegetation and like other ruminants they lack upper incisors instead having a tough pad at the front of their upper jaw biology diet deer are browsers and feed primarily on foliage of grasses sedges forbs shrubs and trees with additional consumption of lichens in northern latitudes during winter they have small unspecialized stomachs by ruminant standards and high nutrition requirements rather than eating and digesting vast quantities of fibrous food as for example sheep and cattle do deer select easily digestible shoots young leaves fresh grasses soft twigs fruit fungi and lichens the food after minimal fermentation and shredding passes rapidly through the alimentary canal the deer require a large amount of minerals such as calcium and phosphate in order to support antler growth and this further necessitates a diet there are however some reports of deer engaging in carnivorous activity such as eating dead alewives along lakeshores or depredating the nests of northern bobwhites reproduction nearly all cervids are uniparental species the fawns are only cared for by the mother known as a doe a doe generally has one or two fawns at a time triplets while not unknown are uncommon mating season typically begins in later august and lasts until december some species mate until early march the gestation period is anywhere up to ten months for the european roe deer most fawns are born with their fur covered with white spots though in many species they lose these spots by the end of their first winter in the first twenty minutes of a fawn life the fawn begins to take its first steps its mother licks it clean until it is almost free of scent so predators will not find it its mother leaves often to graze and the fawn does not like to be left behind sometimes its mother must gently push it down with her foot the fawn stays hidden in the grass for one week until it is strong enough to walk with its mother the fawn and its mother stay together for about one year a male usually leaves and never sees his mother again but females sometimes come back with their own fawns and form small herds disease in some areas of the uk deer especially fallow deer due to their gregarious behaviour have been implicated as a possible reservoir for transmission of bovine tuberculosis a disease which in the uk in cost million in attempts to eradicate in new zealand deer are thought to be important as vectors picking up m bovis in areas where brushtail possums trichosurus vulpecula are infected and transferring it to previously uninfected possums when their carcasses are scavenged elsewhere the deer odocoileus virginianus has been confirmed as the sole maintenance host in the michigan outbreak of bovine tuberculosis which remains a significant barrier to the us nationwide eradication of the disease in livestockmoose and deer can carry rabiesdocile moose may suffer from brain worm a helminth which drills holes through the brain in its search for a suitable place to lay its eggs a government biologist states that they move around looking for the right spot and never really find it deer appear to be immune to this parasite it passes through the digestive system and is excreted in the feces the parasite is not screened by the moose intestine and passes into the brain where damage is done that is externally apparent both in behaviour and in gaitdeer elk and moose in north america may suffer from chronic wasting disease which was identified at a colorado laboratory in the and is believed to be a prion disease out of an abundance of caution hunters are advised to avoid contact with specified risk material srm such as the brain spinal column or lymph nodes deboning the meat when butchering and sanitizing the knives and other tools used to butcher are amongst other government recommendations evolution deer are believed to have evolved from antlerless tusked ancestors that resembled modern duikers and diminutive deer in the early eocene and gradually developed into the first antlered cervoids the superfamily of cervids and related extinct families in the miocene eventually with the development of antlers the tusks as well as the upper incisors disappeared thus evolution of deer took nearly million years biologist valerius geist suggests evolution to have occurred in stages there are not many prominent fossils to trace this evolution but only fragments of skeletons and antlers that might be easily confused with false antlers of species eocene epoch the ruminants ancestors of the cervidae are believed to have evolved from diacodexis the earliest known artiodactyl ungulate mya in the eocene diacodexis nearly the size of a rabbit featured the talus bone characteristic of all modern ungulates this ancestor and its relatives occurred throughout north america and eurasia but were on the decline by at least mya analysis of a nearly complete skeleton of diacodexis discovered in gave rise to speculation that this ancestor could be closer to the than the ruminants andromeryx is another prominent prehistoric ruminant but appears to be closer to the tragulids oligocene epoch the formation of the himalayas and the alps brought about significant geographic changes this was the chief reason behind the extensive diversification of forms and the emergence of cervids from the oligocene to the early pliocene the latter half of the oligocene mya saw the appearance of the european eumeryx and the north american leptomeryx the latter resembled bovids and cervids in dental morphology for instance it had brachyodont molars while the former was more advanced other forms included the north american blastomeryx and the european dremotherium these animals are believed to have been the direct ancestors of all modern antlered deer though they themselves lacked antlers another contemporaneous form was the protoceratid protoceras that was replaced by syndyoceras in the miocene these animals were unique in having a horn on the nose late eocene fossils dated approximately million years ago which were found in north america show that syndyoceras had bony skull outgrowths that resembled antlers miocene epoch fossil evidence suggests that the earliest members of the superfamily cervoidea appeared in eurasia in the miocene dicrocerus euprox and heteroprox were probably the first antlered cervids dicrocerus featured antlers that were shed regularly stephanocemas had more developed and diffuse crowned antlers procervulus palaeomerycidae in addition to the tusks of dremotherium possessed antlers that were not shed contemporary forms such as the merycodontines eventually gave rise to the modern pronghornthe cervinae emerged as the first group of extant cervids around mya during the late miocene in central asia the tribe muntiacini made its appearance as muntiacus leilaoensis around mya the early muntjacs varied in small as hares or as large as fallow deer they had tusks for fighting and antlers for defence capreolinae followed soon after alceini appeared mya around this period the tethys ocean disappeared to give way to vast stretches of grassland these provided the deer with abundant vegetation that led to the development of ornamental antlers and allowed populations to flourish and colonise areas as antlers had become pronounced the canines were no more retained or were poorly represented as in elk probably because diet was no more and antlers were better display organs in muntjac and tufted deer the antlers as well as the canines are small the tragulids however possess long canines to this day pliocene epoch with the onset of the pliocene the global climate became cooler a fall in the led to massive glaciation consequently grasslands abounded in nutritious forage thus a new spurt in deer populations ensued the oldest member of cervini cervocerus novorossiae appeared around the transition from miocene to pliocene mya in eurasia cervine fossils from early pliocene to as late as the pleistocene have been excavated in china and the himalayas while cervus and dama appeared nearly mya axis emerged during the late the tribes capreolini and rangiferini appeared around myaaround mya the rangiferines bretzia and eocoileus were the first cervids to reach north america this implies the bering strait could be crossed during the late this appears highly probable as the camelids migrated into asia from north america around the same time deer invaded south america in the late pliocene mya as part of the great american interchange thanks to the recently formed isthmus of panama and emerged successful due to the small number of competing ruminants in the continent pleistocene epoch large deer with impressive antlers evolved during the early pleistocene probably as a result of abundant resources to drive evolution the early pleistocene cervid eucladoceros was comparable in size to the modern elk megaloceros featured the irish elk m giganteus one of the largest known cervids the irish elk reached metres ft at the shoulder and had heavy antlers that spanned metres ft from tip to tip these large animals are thought to have faced extinction due to conflict between sexual selection for large antlers and body and natural selection for a smaller form meanwhile the moose and reindeer radiated into north america from siberia taxonomy and classification deer constitute the artiodactyl family cervidae this family was first described by german zoologist georg august goldfuss in handbuch der zoologie three subfamilies are recognised capreolinae first described by the english zoologist joshua brookes in cervinae described by goldfuss and hydropotinae first described by french zoologist edouard louis trouessart in other attempts at the classification of deer have been based on morphological and genetic differences the naturalist victor brooke suggested in that deer could be bifurcated into two classes on the according to the features of the second and fifth metacarpal bones of their forelimbs plesiometacarpalia most old world deer and telemetacarpalia most new world deer he treated the musk deer as a cervid placing it under telemetacarpalia while the telemetacarpal deer showed only those elements located far from the joint the plesiometacarpal deer retained the elements closer to the joint as well differentiation on the basis of diploid number of chromosomes in the late century has been flawed by several inconsistenciesin the zoologists colin groves and peter grubb identified three subfamilies cervinae hydropotinae and odocoileinae they noted that the hydropotines lack antlers and the other two subfamilies differ in their skeletal morphology however they reverted from this classification in external relationships until the beginning of the century it was understood that the family moschidae musk deer is sister to cervidae however a phylogenetic study by alexandre hassanin of national museum of natural history france and colleagues based on mitochondrial and nuclear analyses revealed that moschidae and bovidae form a clade sister to cervidae according to the study cervidae diverged from the clade to million years ago the following cladogram is based on the study internal relationships a phylogenetic study of the internal relationships in cervidae by clement gilbert and colleagues divided the family into two major clades capreolinae telemetacarpal or new world deer and cervinae plesiometacarpal or old world deer studies in the late century suggested a similar bifurcation in the family this as well as previous studies support monophyly in cervinae while capreolinae appears paraphyletic the study identified two lineages in cervinae cervini comprising the genera axis cervus dama and rucervus and muntiacini muntiacus and elaphodus capreolinae featured three lineages alceini alces species capreolini capreolus and the subfamily hydropotinae and rangiferini blastocerus hippocamelus mazama odocoileus pudu and rangifer species the following cladogram is based on the study extant subfamilies genera and species the subfamily capreolinae consists of genera and species while cervinae comprises genera and species

erectus fed upon the sika deer while the red deer was hunted in germany in the upper palaeolithic the reindeer was the staple food for people while the cave paintings at lascaux in southwestern france include some images of stags in history deer had a central role in the ancient art culture and mythology of the hittites the ancient egyptians the celts the ancient greeks the asians and several others for instance the stag hunt mosaic of ancient pella under the kingdom of macedonia century bc possibly depicts alexander the great hunting a deer with hephaistion in japanese shintoism the sika

believed in china to accompany the god of longevity deer was the principal sacrificial animal for the huichal indians of mexico in medieval europe deer appeared in hunting scenes and deer are depicted in many materials by various civilizations in the andesthe common male first name oscar is taken from the irish language where it is derived from two elements the first os means deer the second element cara means friend the name is borne by a famous hero of irish grandson of fionn mac cumhail the name was popularised in the century by james macpherson creator of poetry in literature deer have been an integral part of fables and other literary works since the inception of writing stags were used as symbols in the latter sumerian writings for instance the boat of sumerian god enki is named the stag of azbu there are several mentions of the animal in the rigveda as well as the bible in the indian epic ramayana sita is lured by a golden deer which rama tries to catch in the absence of both rama and lakshman ravana kidnaps sita many of the allegorical aesop fables such as the stag at the pool the doe and the stag and a lion personify deer to give moral lessons for instance the sick stag gives the message that uncaring friends can do more harm than good the yaqui deer song accompanies the deer dance which is performed by a pascola from the spanish easter dancer also known as a deer dancer pascolas would perform at religious and social functions many times of the year especially during lent and easterin one of rudolf erich raspe stories of baron munchausen narrative of his marvellous travels and campaigns in russia the baron encounters a stag while eating cherries and without ammunition fires the at the stag with his musket but it escapes the next year the baron encounters a stag with a cherry tree growing from its head presumably this is the animal he had shot at the previous year in christmas lore such as in the narrative poem a visit from st nicholas
