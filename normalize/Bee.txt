bees are flying insects closely related to wasps and ants known for their role in pollination and in the case of the bee species the western honey bee for producing honey bees are a monophyletic lineage within the superfamily apoidea they are presently considered a clade called anthophila there are over known species of bees in seven recognized biological families some species including honey bees bumblebees and stingless bees live socially in colonies while some species including mason bees carpenter bees leafcutter bees and sweat bees are solitary bees are found on every continent except for antarctica in every habitat on the planet that contains flowering plants the most common bees in the northern hemisphere are the halictidae or sweat bees but they are small and often mistaken for wasps or flies bees range in size from tiny stingless bee species whose workers are less than millimetres in long to megachile pluto the largest species of leafcutter bee whose females can attain a length of millimetres in bees feed on nectar and pollen the former primarily as an energy source and the latter primarily for protein and other nutrients most pollen is used as food for their larvae vertebrate predators of bees include birds such as insect predators include beewolves and dragonflies bee pollination is important both ecologically and commercially and the decline in wild bees has increased the value of pollination by commercially managed hives of honey bees the analysis of wild bee and hoverfly species across britain from to found the insects have been lost from a quarter of the places they inhabited in beekeeping or apiculture has been practised for millennia since at least the times of ancient egypt and ancient greece bees have appeared in mythology and folklore through all phases of art and literature from ancient times to the present day although primarily focused in the northern hemisphere where beekeeping is far more common evolution the ancestors of bees were wasps in the family crabronidae which were predators of other insects the switch from insect prey to pollen may have resulted from the consumption of prey insects which were flower visitors and were partially covered with pollen when they were fed to the wasp larvae this same evolutionary scenario may have occurred within the vespoid wasps where the pollen wasps evolved from predatory ancestors until recently the oldest bee fossil had been found in new jersey amber cretotrigona prisca of cretaceous age a corbiculate bee a bee fossil from the early cretaceous mya melittosphex burmensis is considered an extinct lineage of apoidea sister to the modern bees derived features of its morphology apomorphies place it clearly within the bees but it retains two unmodified ancestral traits plesiomorphies of the legs two spurs and a slender hind basitarsus showing its transitional status by the eocene mya there was already considerable diversity among eusocial bee lineagesthe highly eusocial corbiculate apidae appeared roughly mya and the allodapini within the apidae around mya the colletidae appear as fossils only from the late oligocene mya to early miocene the melittidae are known from palaeomacropis eocenicus in the early eocene the megachilidae are known from trace fossils characteristic leaf cuttings from the middle eocene the andrenidae are known from the boundary around mya of the florissant shale the halictidae first appear in the early eocene with species found in amber the stenotritidae are known from fossil brood cells of pleistocene age coevolution the earliest flowers were shallow blooms pollinated by insects such as beetles so the syndrome of insect pollination was well established before the first appearance of bees the novelty is that bees are specialized as pollination agents with behavioral and physical modifications that specifically enhance pollination and are the most efficient pollinating insects in a process of coevolution flowers developed floral rewards such as nectar and longer tubes and bees developed longer tongues to extract the nectar bees also developed structures known as scopal hairs and pollen baskets to collect and carry pollen the location and type differ among and between groups of bees most species have scopal hairs on their hind legs or on the underside of their abdomens some species in the family apidae have pollen baskets on their hind legs while very few lack these and instead collect pollen in their crops the appearance of these structures drove the adaptive radiation of the angiosperms and in turn bees themselves bees coevolved not only with flowers but it is believed that some species coevolved with mites some provide tufts of hairs called acarinaria that appear to provide lodgings for mites in return it is believed that mites eat fungi that attack pollen so the relationship in this case may be mutualistc phylogeny external this phylogenetic tree is based on debevic et al which used molecular phylogeny to demonstrate that the bees anthophila arose from deep within the crabronidae which is therefore paraphyletic the placement of the heterogynaidae is uncertain the small subfamily mellininae was not included in this analysis internal this cladogram of the bee families is based on hedtke et al which places the former families dasypodaidae and meganomiidae as subfamilies inside the melittidae english names where available are given in parentheses characteristics bees differ from closely related groups such as wasps by having branched or setae hairs combs on the forelimbs for cleaning their antennae small anatomical differences in limb structure and the venation of the hind wings and in females by having the seventh dorsal abdominal plate divided into two have the following characteristics a pair of large compound eyes which cover much of the surface of the head between and above these are three small simple eyes ocelli which provide information on light intensity the antennae usually have segments in males and in females and are geniculate having an elbow joint part way along they house large numbers of sense organs that can detect touch mechanoreceptors smell and taste and small hairlike mechanoreceptors that can detect air movement so as to hear sounds the mouthparts are adapted for both chewing and sucking by having both a pair of mandibles and a long proboscis for sucking up nectar the thorax has three segments each with a pair of robust legs and a pair of membranous wings on the hind two segments the front legs of corbiculate bees bear combs for cleaning the antennae and in many species the hind legs bear pollen baskets flattened sections with incurving hairs to secure the collected pollen the wings are synchronised in flight and the somewhat smaller hind wings connect to the forewings by a row of hooks along their margin which connect to a groove in the forewing the abdomen has nine segments the hindermost three being modified into the sting the largest species of bee is thought to be wallace giant bee megachile pluto whose females can attain a length of millimetres in the smallest species may be dwarf stingless bees in the tribe meliponini whose workers are less than millimetres in in length sociality haplodiploid breeding system according to inclusive fitness theory organisms can gain fitness not just through increasing their own reproductive output but also that of close relatives in evolutionary terms individuals should help relatives when cost relatedness benefit the requirements for eusociality are more easily fulfilled by haplodiploid species such as bees because of their unusual relatedness structurein haplodiploid species females develop from fertilized eggs and males from unfertilized eggs because a male is haploid has only one copy of each gene his daughters which are diploid with two copies of each gene share of his genes and of their mother therefore they share of their genes with each other this mechanism of sex determination gives rise to what w d hamilton termed supersisters more closely related to their sisters than they would be to their own offspring workers often do not reproduce but they can pass on more of their genes by helping to raise their sisters as queens than they would by having their own offspring each of which would only have of their genes assuming they would produce similar numbers this unusual situation has been proposed as an explanation of the multiple at least evolutions of eusociality within hymenopterahaplodiploidy is neither necessary nor sufficient for eusociality some eusocial species such as termites are not haplodiploid conversely all bees are haplodiploid but not all are eusocial and among eusocial species many queens mate with multiple males creating that share only of genes but monogamy queens mating singly is the ancestral state for all eusocial species so far investigated so it is likely that haplodiploidy contributed to the evolution of eusociality in bees eusociality bees may be solitary or may live in various types of communities eusociality appears to have originated from at least three independent origins in halictid bees the most advanced of these are species with eusocial colonies these are characterised by cooperative brood care and a division of labour into reproductive and adults plus overlapping generations this division of labour creates specialized groups within eusocial societies which are called castes in some species groups of cohabiting females may be sisters and if there is a division of labour within the group they are considered semisocial the group is called eusocial if in addition the group consists of a mother the queen and her daughters workers when the castes are purely behavioural alternatives with no morphological differentiation other than size the system is considered primitively eusocial as in many paper wasps when the castes are morphologically discrete the system is considered highly eusocialtrue honey bees genus apis of which seven species are currently recognized are highly eusocial and are among the best known insects their colonies are established by swarms consisting of a queen and several hundred workers there are subspecies of one of these species apis mellifera native to europe the middle east and africa africanized bees are a hybrid strain of a mellifera that escaped from experiments involving crossing european and african subspecies they are extremely defensivestingless bees are also highly eusocial they practise mass provisioning with complex nest architecture and perennial colonies also established via swarming many bumblebees are eusocial similar to the eusocial vespidae such as hornets in that the queen initiates a nest on her own rather than by swarming bumblebee colonies typically have from to bees at peak population which occurs in mid to late summer nest architecture is simple limited by the size of the nest cavity and colonies rarely last more than a year in the international union for conservation of nature set up the bumblebee specialist group to review the threat status of all bumblebee species worldwide using the iucn red list criteriathere are many more species of primitively eusocial than highly eusocial bees but they have been studied less often most are in the family halictidae or sweat bees colonies are typically small with a dozen or fewer workers on average queens and workers differ only in size if at all most species have a single season colony cycle even in the tropics and only mated females hibernate a few species have long active seasons and attain colony sizes in the hundreds such as halictus hesperus some species are eusocial in parts of their range and solitary in others or have a mix of eusocial and solitary nests in the same population the orchid bees apidae include some primitively eusocial species with similar biology some allodapine bees apidae form primitively eusocial colonies with progressive provisioning a larva food is supplied gradually as it develops as is the case in honey bees and some bumblebees solitary and communal bees most other bees including familiar insects such as carpenter bees leafcutter bees and mason bees are solitary in the sense that every female is fertile and typically inhabits a nest she constructs herself there is no division of labor so these nests lack queens and worker bees for these species solitary bees typically produce neither honey nor beeswax bees collect pollen to feed their young and have the necessary adaptations to do this however certain wasp species such as pollen wasps have similar behaviours and a few species of bee scavenge from carcases to feed their offspring solitary bees are important pollinators they gather pollen to provision their nests with food for their brood often it is mixed with nectar to form a consistency some solitary bees have advanced types of structures on their bodies very few species of solitary bee are being cultured for commercial pollination most of these species belong to a distinct set of genera which are commonly known by their nesting behavior or preferences namely carpenter bees sweat bees mason bees plasterer bees squash bees dwarf carpenter bees leafcutter bees alkali bees and digger bees most solitary bees nest in the ground in a variety of soil textures and conditions while others create nests in hollow reeds or twigs holes in wood the female typically creates a compartment a cell with an egg and some provisions for the resulting larva then seals it off a nest may consist of numerous cells when the nest is in wood usually the last those closer to the entrance contain eggs that will become males the adult does not provide care for the brood once the egg is laid and usually dies after making one or more nests the males typically emerge first and are ready for mating when the females emerge solitary bees are either stingless or very unlikely to sting only in if ever while solitary females each make individual nests some species such as the european mason bee hoplitis anthocopoides and the dawson burrowing bee amegilla dawsoni are gregarious preferring to make nests near others of the same species and giving the appearance of being social large groups of solitary bee nests are called aggregations to distinguish them from colonies in some species multiple females share a common nest but each makes and provisions her own cells independently this type of group is called communal and is not uncommon the primary advantage appears to be that a nest entrance is easier to defend from predators and parasites when there are multiple females using that same entrance on a regular basis biology life cycle the life cycle of a bee be it a solitary or social species involves the laying of an egg the development through several moults of a legless larva a pupation stage during which the insect undergoes complete metamorphosis followed by the emergence of a winged adult most solitary bees and bumble bees in temperate climates overwinter as adults or pupae and emerge in spring when increasing numbers of flowering plants come into bloom the males usually emerge first and search for females with which to mate the sex of a bee is determined by whether or not the egg is fertilised after mating a female stores the sperm and determines which sex is required at the time each individual egg is laid fertilised eggs producing female offspring and unfertilised eggs males tropical bees may have several generations in a year and no diapause stagethe egg is generally oblong slightly curved and tapering at one end solitary bees lay each egg in a separate cell with a supply of mixed pollen and nectar next to it this may be rolled into a pellet or placed in a pile and is known as mass provisioning social bee species provision progressively that is they feed the larva regularly while it grows the nest varies from a hole in the ground or in wood in solitary bees to a substantial structure with wax combs in bumblebees and honey beesin most species larvae are whitish grubs roughly oval and at both ends they have segments and spiracles in each segment for breathing they have no legs but move within the cell helped by tubercles on their sides they have short horns on the head jaws for chewing food and an appendage on either side of the mouth tipped with a bristle there is a gland under the mouth that secretes a viscous liquid which solidifies into the silk they use to produce a cocoon the cocoon is and the pupa can be seen through it over the course of a few days the larva undergoes metamorphosis into a winged adult when ready to emerge the adult splits its skin dorsally and climbs out of the exuviae and breaks out of the cell flight antoine magnan book le vol des insectes says that he and andre had applied the equations of air resistance to insects and found that their flight could not be explained by calculations but that one should be surprised that the results of the calculations do square with reality this has led to a common misconception that bees violate aerodynamic theory in fact it merely confirms that bees do not engage in flight and that their flight is explained by other mechanics such as those used by helicopters in it was shown that vortices created by many insects wings helped to provide lift cinematography and robotic of a bee wing showed that lift was generated by the unconventional combination of short choppy wing strokes a rapid rotation of the wing as it flops over and reverses direction and a very fast frequency frequency normally increases as size decreases but as the bee wing beat covers such a small arc it flaps approximately times per second faster than a fruitfly times per second which is times smaller navigation communication and finding food the ethologist karl von frisch studied navigation in the honey bee he showed that honey bees communicate by the waggle dance in which a worker indicates the location of a food source to other workers in the hive he demonstrated that bees can recognize a desired compass direction in three different ways by the sun by the polarization pattern of the blue sky and by the earth magnetic field he showed that the sun is the preferred or main compass the other mechanisms are used under cloudy skies or inside a dark beehive bees navigate using spatial memory with a rich organization digestion the gut of bees is relatively simple but multiple metabolic strategies exist in the gut microbiota pollinating bees consume nectar and pollen which require different digestion strategies by somewhat specialized bacteria while nectar is a liquid of mostly monosaccharide sugars and so easily absorbed pollen contains complex polysaccharides branching pectin and hemicellulose approximately five groups of bacteria are involved in digestion three groups specialize in simple sugars snodgrassella and two groups of lactobacillus and two other groups in complex sugars gilliamella and bifidobacterium digestion of pectin and hemicellulose is dominated by bacterial clades gilliamella and bifidobacterium respectively bacteria that can not digest polysaccharides obtain enzymes from their neighbors and bacteria that lack certain amino acids do the same creating multiple ecological nichesalthough most bee species are nectarivorous and palynivorous some are not particularly unusual are vulture bees in the genus trigona which consume carrion and wasp brood turning meat into a substance ecology floral relationships most bees are polylectic generalist meaning they collect pollen from a range of flowering plants but some are oligoleges specialists in that they only gather pollen from one or a few species or genera of closely related plants specialist pollinators also include bee species which gather floral oils instead of pollen and male orchid bees which gather aromatic compounds from orchids one of the few cases where male bees are effective pollinators bees are able to sense the presence of desirable flowers through ultraviolet patterning on flowers floral odors and even electromagnetic fields once landed a bee then uses nectar quality and pollen taste to determine whether to continue visiting similar flowers in rare cases a plant species may only be effectively pollinated by a single bee species and some plants are endangered at least in part because their pollinator is also threatened but there is a pronounced tendency for oligolectic bees to be associated with common widespread plants visited by multiple pollinator species for example the creosote bush in the arid parts of the united states southwest is associated with some oligoleges as mimics and models many bees are aposematically coloured typically orange and black warning of their ability to defend themselves with a powerful sting as such they are models for batesian mimicry by insects such as robber flies and hoverflies all of which gain a measure of protection by superficially looking and behaving like beesbees are themselves mullerian mimics of other aposematic insects with the same colour scheme including wasps lycid and other beetles and many butterflies and moths lepidoptera which are themselves distasteful often through acquiring bitter and poisonous chemicals from their plant food all the mullerian mimics including bees benefit from the reduced risk of predation that results from their easily recognised warning colorationbees are also mimicked by plants such as the bee orchid which imitates both the appearance and the scent of a female bee male bees attempt to mate pseudocopulation with the furry lip of the flower thus pollinating it as brood parasites brood parasites occur in several bee families including the apid subfamily nomadinae females of these species lack pollen collecting structures the scopa and do not construct their own nests they typically enter the nests of pollen collecting species and lay their eggs in cells provisioned by the host bee when the cuckoo bee larva hatches it consumes the host larva pollen ball and often the host egg also in particular the arctic bee species bombus hyperboreus is an aggressive species that attacks and enslaves other bees of the same subgenus however unlike many other bee brood parasites they have pollen baskets and often collect pollenin southern africa hives of african honeybees a mellifera scutellata are being destroyed by parasitic workers of the cape honeybee a m capensis these lay diploid eggs thelytoky escaping normal worker policing leading to the colony destruction the parasites can then move to other hivesthe cuckoo bees in the bombus subgenus psithyrus are closely related to and resemble their hosts in looks and size this common pattern gave rise to the ecological principle emery rule others parasitize bees in different families like townsendiella a nomadine apid two species of which are cleptoparasites of the dasypodaid genus hesperapis while the other species in the same genus attacks halictid bees nocturnal bees four bee families andrenidae colletidae halictidae and apidae contain some species that are crepuscular most are tropical or subtropical but some live in arid regions at higher latitudes these bees have greatly enlarged ocelli which are extremely sensitive to light and dark though incapable of forming images some have refracting superposition compound eyes these combine the output of many elements of their compound eyes to provide enough light for each retinal photoreceptor their ability to fly by night enables them to avoid many predators and to exploit flowers that produce nectar only or also at night predators parasites and pathogens vertebrate predators of bees include shrikes and flycatchers which make short sallies to catch insects in flight swifts and swallows fly almost continually catching insects as they go the honey buzzard attacks bees nests and eats the larvae the greater honeyguide interacts with humans by guiding them to the nests of wild bees the humans break open the nests and take the honey and the bird feeds on the larvae and the wax among mammals predators such as the badger dig up bumblebee nests and eat both the larvae and any stored food specialist ambush predators of visitors to flowers include crab spiders which wait on flowering plants for pollinating insects predatory bugs and praying mantises some of which the flower mantises of the tropics wait motionless aggressive mimics camouflaged as flowers beewolves are large wasps that habitually attack bees the ethologist niko tinbergen estimated that a single colony of the beewolf philanthus triangulum might kill several thousand honeybees in a day all the prey he observed were honeybees other predatory insects that sometimes catch bees include robber flies and dragonflies honey bees are affected by parasites including acarine and varroa mites however some bees are believed to have a mutualistic relationship with mites relationship with humans in mythology and folklore homer hymn to hermes describes three with the power of divination and thus speaking truth and identifies the food of the gods as honey sources associated the bee maidens with apollo and until the scholars followed gottfried hermann in incorrectly identifying the with the thriae honey according to a greek myth was discovered by a nymph called melissa bee and honey was offered to the greek gods from mycenean times bees were also associated with the delphic oracle and the prophetess was sometimes called a beethe image of a community of honey bees has been used from ancient to modern times in aristotle and plato in virgil and seneca in erasmus and shakespeare tolstoy and by political and social theorists such as bernard mandeville and karl marx as a model for human society in english folklore bees would be told of important events in the household in a custom known as telling the bees in art and literature some of the oldest examples of bees in art are rock paintings in spain which have been dated to bcw b yeats poem the lake isle of innisfree contains the couplet nine bean rows will i have there a hive for the honey bee and live alone in the bee loud glade at the time he was living in bedford park in the west of london beatrix potter illustrated book the tale of mrs tittlemouse features babbity bumble and her brood pictured kit williams treasure hunt book the bee on the comb uses bees and beekeeping as part of its story and puzzle sue monk kidd the secret life of bees and the film starring dakota fanning tells the story of a girl who escapes her abusive home and finds her way to live with a family of beekeepers the boatwrights the humorous animated film bee movie used jerry seinfeld first script and was his first work for children he starred as a bee named barry b benson alongside renee zellweger critics found its premise awkward and its delivery tame dave goulson a sting in the tale describes his efforts to save bumblebees in britain as well as much about their biology the playwright laline paull fantasy the bees tells the tale of a hive bee named flora from hatching onwards beekeeping humans have kept honey bee colonies commonly in hives for millennia beekeepers collect honey beeswax propolis pollen and royal jelly from hives bees are also kept to pollinate crops and to produce bees for sale to other beekeepers depictions of humans collecting honey from wild bees date to years ago efforts to domesticate them are shown in egyptian art around years ago simple hives and smoke were used jars of honey were found in the tombs of pharaohs such as tutankhamun from the century european understanding of the colonies and biology of bees allowed the construction of the moveable comb hive so that honey could be harvested without destroying the colony among classical era authors beekeeping with the use of smoke is described in aristotle history of animals book the account mentions that bees die after stinging that workers remove corpses from the hive and guard it castes including workers and drones but kings rather than queens predators including toads and and the waggle dance with the irresistible suggestion of aposeiontai aroseiontai it waggles and parakolouthousin parakolouthousin they watch beekeeping is described in detail by virgil in his eclogues it is also mentioned in his aeneid and in pliny natural history as commercial pollinators bees play an important role in pollinating flowering plants and are the major type of pollinator in many ecosystems that contain flowering plants it is estimated that one third of the human food supply depends on pollination by insects birds and bats most of which is accomplished by bees whether wild or domesticated over the last half century there has been a general decline in the species richness of wild bees and other pollinators probably attributable to stress from increased parasites and disease the use of pesticides and a general decrease in the number of wild flowers climate change probably exacerbates the problemcontract pollination has overtaken the role of honey production for beekeepers in many countries after the introduction of varroa mites feral honey bees declined dramatically in the us though their numbers have since recovered the number of colonies kept by beekeepers declined slightly through urbanization systematic pesticide use tracheal and varroa mites and the closure of beekeeping businesses in and the rate of attrition increased and was described as colony collapse disorder in invertebrate iridescent virus and the fungus nosema ceranae were shown to be in every killed colony and deadly in combination winter losses increased to about varroa mites were thought to be responsible for about half the lossesapart from colony collapse disorder losses outside the us have been attributed to causes including pesticide seed dressings using neonicotinoids such as clothianidin imidacloprid and thiamethoxam from the european union restricted some pesticides to stop bee populations from declining further in the intergovernmental panel on climate change report warned that bees faced increased risk of extinction because of global warming in the european union decided to ban field use of all three major neonicotinoids they remain permitted in veterinary greenhouse and vehicle transport usagefarmers have focused on alternative solutions to mitigate these problems by raising native plants they provide food for native bee pollinators like lasioglossum vierecki and l leucozonium leading to less reliance on honey bee populations as food producers honey is a natural product produced by bees and stored for their own use but its sweetness has always appealed to humans before domestication of bees was even attempted humans were raiding their nests for their honey smoke was often used to subdue the bees and such activities are depicted in rock paintings in spain dated to bchoney bees are used commercially to produce honey they also produce some substances used as dietary supplements with possible health benefits pollen propolis and royal jelly though all of these can also cause allergic reactions as food bee brood bees are partly considered edible insects indigenous people in many countries eat insects including the larvae and pupae of bees mostly stingless species they also gather larvae pupae and surrounding cells known as bee brood for consumption in the indonesian dish botok tawon from central and east java bee larvae are eaten as a companion to rice after being mixed with shredded coconut wrapped in banana leaves and steamedbee brood pupae and larvae although low in calcium has been found to be high in protein and carbohydrate and a useful source of phosphorus magnesium potassium and trace minerals iron zinc copper and selenium in addition while bee brood was high in fat it contained no fat soluble vitamins such as a d and e but it was a good source of most of the including choline as well as vitamin c the fat was composed mostly of saturated and monounsaturated fatty acids with being polyunsaturated fatty acids as alternative medicine apitherapy is a branch of alternative medicine that uses honey bee products including raw honey royal jelly pollen propolis beeswax and apitoxin bee venom the claim that apitherapy treats cancer which some proponents of apitherapy make remains unsupported by medicine stings the painful stings of bees are mostly associated with the poison gland and the dufour gland which are abdominal exocrine glands containing various chemicals in lasioglossum leucozonium the dufour gland mostly contains octadecanolide as well as some eicosanolide there is also evidence of and however the secretions of these glands could also be used for nest construction see also australian native bees superorganism notes references external links bees encyclopedia of life apoidea at all living identification guides and maps of bees
