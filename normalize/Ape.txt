apes hominoidea are a branch of old world tailless simians native to africa and southeast asia they are the sister group of the old world monkeys together forming the catarrhine clade they are distinguished from other primates by a wider degree of freedom of motion at the shoulder joint as evolved by the influence of brachiation in traditional and use the term ape excludes humans and can include tailless primates taxonomically considered monkeys such as the barbary ape and is thus not equivalent to the scientific taxon hominoidea there are two extant branches of the superfamily hominoidea the gibbons or lesser apes and the hominids or great apes the family hylobatidae the lesser apes include four genera and a total of sixteen species of gibbon including the lar gibbon and the siamang all native to asia they are highly arboreal and bipedal on the ground they have lighter bodies and smaller social groups than great apes the family hominidae hominids the great apes also include four genera comprising three extant species of orangutans and their subspecies two extant species of gorillas and their subspecies two extant species of chimpanzees and their subspecies and one extant species of humans in a single extant subspeciesexcept for gorillas and humans hominoids are agile climbers of trees apes eat a variety of plant and animal foods with the majority of food being plant foods which can include fruit leaves stalks roots and seeds including nuts and grass seeds human diets are sometimes substantially different from that of other apes due in part to the development of technology and a wide range of habitation humans are by far the most numerous of the ape species in fact outnumbering all other primates by a factor of several thousand to one most hominoids are rare or endangered the chief threat to most of the endangered species is loss of tropical rainforest habitat though some populations are further imperiled by hunting for bushmeat the great apes of africa are also facing threat from the ebola virus currently considered to be the greatest threat to survival of african apes ebola infection is responsible for the death of at least one third of all gorillas and chimpanzees since name and terminology ape from old english apa is a word of uncertain origin the term has a history of rather imprecise of comedic or punning usage in the vernacular its earliest meaning was generally of any anthropoid primate as is still the case for its cognates in other germanic languages later after the term monkey had been introduced into english ape was specialized to refer to a tailless therefore exceptionally primate thus the term ape obtained two different meanings as shown in the encyclopaedia britannica entry it could be used as a synonym for monkey and it could denote the tailless humanlike primate in particularsome or recently all hominoids are also called apes but the term is used broadly and has several different senses within both popular and scientific settings ape has been used as a synonym for monkey or for naming any primate with a appearance particularly those without a tail biologists have traditionally used the term ape to mean a member of the superfamily hominoidea other than humans but more recently to mean all members of hominoidea so ape to be confused with great ape becomes another word for hominoid including humansthe taxonomic term hominoid is derived from and intended as encompassing the hominids the family of great apes both terms were introduced by gray the term hominins is also due to gray intended as including the human lineage see also hominidae terminology human taxonomy the distinction between apes and monkeys is complicated by the traditional paraphyly of monkeys apes emerged as a sister group of old world monkeys in the catarhines which are a sister group of new world monkeys therefore cladistically apes catarrhines and related contemporary extinct groups such as parapithecidaea are monkeys as well for any consistent definition of monkey old world monkey may also legitimately be taken to be meant to include all the catarrhines including apes and extinct species such as aegyptopithecus in which case the apes cercopithecoidea and aegyptopithecus emerged within the old world monkeys the primates called apes today became known to europeans after the century as zoological knowledge developed it became clear that taillessness occurred in a number of different and otherwise distantly related species sir wilfrid le gros clark was one of those primatologists who developed the idea that there were trends in primate evolution and that the extant members of the order could be arranged in an ascending series leading from monkeys to apes to humans within this tradition ape came to refer to all members of the superfamily hominoidea except humans as such this use of apes represented a paraphyletic grouping meaning that even though all species of apes were descended from a common ancestor this grouping did not include all the descendant species because humans were excluded from being among the apestraditionally the vernacular name apes does not include humans but phylogenetically humans homo form part of the family hominidae within hominoidaea thus there are at least three common or traditional uses of the term ape may not distinguish between monkeys and apes that is they may use the two terms interchangeably or they may use ape for any tailless monkey or hominoid or they may use the term ape to just mean the hominoids modern taxonomy aims for the use of monophyletic groups for taxonomic classification some literature may now use the common name ape to mean all members of the superfamily hominoidea including humans for example in his book benton wrote the apes hominoidea today include the gibbons and the gorilla and chimpanzee and humans modern biologists and primatologists refer to apes that are not human as apes scientists broadly other than paleoanthropologists may use the term hominin to identify the human clade replacing the term hominid see terminology of primate names see below history of hominoid taxonomy for a discussion of changes in scientific classification and terminology regarding hominoids phylogeny genetic analysis combined with fossil evidence indicates that hominoids diverged from

crested gibbon n leucogenys gibbon n gabriellae morphology the lesser apes are the gibbon family hylobatidae of sixteen species all are native to asia their major differentiating characteristic is their long arms which they use to brachiate through trees their wrists are ball and socket joints as an evolutionary adaptation to their arboreal lifestyle generally smaller than the african apes the largest gibbon the siamang weighs up to kg lb in comparison the smallest great ape the bonobo is to kg to lb the superfamily hominoidea falls within the parvorder catarrhini which also includes the old world monkeys of africa and eurasia within this grouping the two families hylobatidae and hominidae can be distinguished from old world monkeys by the number of cusps on their molars hominoids have five in the molar pattern whereas old world monkeys have only four in a bilophodont pattern further in comparison with old world monkeys hominoids are noted for more mobile shoulder joints and arms due to the dorsal position of the scapula broader ribcages that are flatter and a shorter less mobile spine with greatly reduced caudal tail in complete loss of the tail in living hominoid species these are anatomical adaptations first to vertical hanging and swinging locomotion brachiation and later to developing balance in a bipedal pose note there are primates in other families that also lack tails and at least one the langur is known to walk significant distances bipedally the front of the ape skull is characterised by its sinuses fusion of the frontal bone and by constriction although the hominoid fossil record is still incomplete and fragmentary there is now enough evidence to provide an outline of the evolutionary history of humans previously the divergence between humans and other living hominoids was thought to have occurred to million years ago and several species of that time period such as ramapithecus were once thought to be hominins and possible ancestors of humans but later fossil finds indicated that ramapithecus was more closely related to the orangutan and new biochemical evidence indicates that the last common ancestor of humans and that is the chimpanzees occurred between and million years ago and probably nearer the lower end of that range see last common ancestor chlca distinction from monkeys cladistically apes catarrhines and extinct species such as aegyptopithecus and parapithecidaea are monkeys so one can only specify ape features not present in other monkeys apes do not possess a tail unlike most monkeys monkeys are more likely to be in trees and use their tails for balance while the great apes are considerably larger than monkeys gibbons lesser apes are smaller than some monkeys apes are considered to be more intelligent than monkeys which are considered to have more primitive brains behaviour major studies of behaviour in the field were completed on the three great apes for example by jane goodall dian fossey and birute galdikas these studies have shown that in their natural environments the hominoids show sharply varying social structure gibbons are monogamous territorial orangutans are solitary gorillas live in small troops with a single adult male leader while chimpanzees live in larger troops with bonobos exhibiting promiscuous sexual behaviour their diets also vary gorillas are foliovores while the others are all primarily frugivores although the common chimpanzee does some hunting for meat foraging behaviour is correspondingly variable diet apart from humans and gorillas apes eat a predominantly frugivorous diet mostly fruit but supplemented with a variety of other foods gorillas are predominately folivorous eating mostly stalks shoots roots and leaves with some fruit and other foods apes usually eat a small amount of raw animal foods such as insects or eggs in the case of humans migration and the invention of hunting tools and cooking has led to an even wider variety of foods and diets with many human diets including large amounts of cooked tubers roots or legumes other food production and processing methods including animal husbandry and industrial refining and processing have further changed human diets humans and other apes occasionally eat other primates some of these primates are now close to extinction with habitat loss being the underlying cause cognition all the hominoids are generally thought of as highly intelligent and scientific study has broadly confirmed that they perform very well on a wide range of cognitive there is relatively little data on gibbon cognition the early studies by wolfgang kohler demonstrated exceptional abilities in chimpanzees which kohler attributed to insight the use of tools has been repeatedly demonstrated more recently the manufacture of tools has been documented both in the wild and in laboratory tests imitation is much more easily demonstrated in great apes than in other primate species almost all the studies in animal language acquisition have been done with great apes and though there is continuing dispute as to whether they demonstrate real language abilities there is no doubt that they involve significant feats of learning chimpanzees in different parts of africa have developed tools that are used in food acquisition demonstrating a form of animal culture history of hominoid taxonomy the history of hominoid taxonomy is complex and somewhat confusing recent evidence has changed our understanding of the relationships between the hominoids especially regarding the human lineage and the traditionally used terms have become somewhat confused competing approaches to methodology and terminology are found among current scientific sources over time authorities have changed the names and the meanings of names of groups and subgroups as new is new discoveries of fossils and tools and of observations in the field plus continual comparisons of anatomy and dna changed the understanding of relationships between hominoids there has been a gradual demotion of humans from being in the taxonomy to being one branch among many this recent turmoil of history illustrates the growing influence on all taxonomy of cladistics the science of classifying living things strictly according to their lines of descent today there are eight extant genera of hominoids they are the four genera in the family hominidae namely homo pan gorilla and pongo plus four genera in the family hylobatidae gibbons hylobates hoolock nomascus and symphalangus the two subspecies of hoolock gibbons were recently moved from the genus bunopithecus to the new genus hoolock and as species a third species was described in january in carl linnaeus relying on or accounts placed a second species in homo along with h sapiens homo troglodytes man although the term orang outang is listed as a variety homo sylvestris under this species it is nevertheless not clear to which animal this name refers as linnaeus had no specimen to refer to hence no precise description linnaeus may have based homo troglodytes on reports of mythical creatures simians or asian natives dressed in animal skins linnaeus named the orangutan simia satyrus satyr monkey he placed the three genera homo simia and lemur in the order of primates the troglodytes name was used for the chimpanzee by blumenbach in but moved to the genus simia the orangutan was moved to the genus pongo in by lacepede linnaeus inclusion of humans in the primates with monkeys and apes was troubling for people who denied a close relationship between humans and the rest of the animal kingdom linnaeus lutheran archbishop had accused him of impiety in a letter to johann georg gmelin dated february linnaeus wrote it is not pleasing to me that i must place humans among the primates but man is intimately familiar with himself let not quibble over words it will be the same to me whatever name is applied but i desperately seek from you and from the whole world a general difference between men and simians from the principles of natural history i certainly know of none if only someone might tell me one if i called man a simian or vice versa i would bring together all the theologians against me perhaps i ought to in accordance with the law of natural historyaccordingly johann friedrich blumenbach in the first edition of his manual of natural history proposed that the primates be divided into the quadrumana ie apes and monkeys and bimana ie humans this distinction was taken up by other naturalists most notably georges cuvier some elevated the distinction to the level of order however the many affinities between humans and other primates and especially the great apes made it clear that the distinction made no scientific sense in the descent of man charles darwin wrote the greater number of naturalists who have taken into consideration the whole structure of man including his mental faculties have followed blumenbach and cuvier and have placed man in a separate order under the title of the bimana and therefore on an equality with the orders of the quadrumana carnivora etc recently many of our best naturalists have recurred to the view first propounded by linnaeus so remarkable for his sagacity and have placed man in the same order with the quadrumana under the title of the primates the justice of this conclusion will be admitted for in the first place we must bear in mind the comparative insignificance for classification of the great development of the brain in man and that the strongly marked differences between the skulls of man and the quadrumana lately insisted upon by bischoff aeby and others apparently follow from their differently developed brains in the second place we must remember that nearly all the other and more important differences between man and the quadrumana are manifestly adaptive in their nature and relate chiefly to the erect position of man such as the structure of his hand foot and pelvis the curvature of his spine and the position of his head changes in taxonomy and terminology hominid v hominin see also notes references external links data
