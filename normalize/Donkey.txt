the donkey or ass equus africanus asinus is a domesticated member of the horse family equidae the wild ancestor of the donkey is the african wild ass e africanus the donkey has been used as a working animal for at least years there are more than million donkeys in the world mostly in underdeveloped countries where they are used principally as draught or pack animals working donkeys are often associated with those living at or below subsistence levels small numbers of donkeys are kept for breeding or as pets in developed countries a male donkey or ass is called a jack a female a jenny or jennet a young donkey is a foal jack donkeys are often used to mate with female horses to produce mules the biological reciprocal of a mule from a stallion and jenny as its parents instead is called a hinny asses were first domesticated around bc probably in egypt or mesopotamia and have spread around the world they continue to fill important roles in many places today while domesticated species are increasing in numbers the african wild ass is an endangered species as beasts of burden and companions asses and donkeys have worked together with humans for millennia scientific and common names traditionally the scientific name for the donkey is equus asinus asinus based on the principle of priority used for scientific names of animals however the international commission on zoological nomenclature ruled in that if the domestic species and the wild species are considered subspecies of one another the scientific name of the wild species has priority even when that subspecies was described after the domestic subspecies this means that the proper scientific name for the donkey is equus africanus asinus when it is considered a subspecies and equus asinus when it is considered a species at one time the synonym ass was the more common term for the donkey the first recorded use of donkey was in either or while the word ass has cognates in most other languages donkey is an etymologically obscure word for which no credible cognate has been identified hypotheses on its derivation include the following perhaps from spanish for its gravity the donkey was also known as the king of spain trumpeter perhaps a diminutive of dun dull a typical donkey colour perhaps from the name duncan perhaps of imitative originfrom the century donkey gradually replaced ass and jenny replaced which is now considered archaic the change may have come about through a tendency to avoid pejorative terms in speech and be comparable to the substitution in north american english of rooster for cock or that of rabbit for coney which was formerly homophonic with cunny a variation of the word cunt by the end of the century changes in pronunciation of both ass and arse had caused them to become homophones in some varieties of english other words used for the ass in english from this time include cuddy in scotland neddy in southwest england and dicky in the southeast moke is documented in the century and may be of welsh or gypsy origin characteristics donkeys vary considerably in size depending on breed and management the height at the withers ranges from to hands to inches to cm and the weight from to kg to lb working donkeys in the poorest countries have a life expectancy of to years in more prosperous countries they may have a lifespan of to yearsdonkeys are adapted to marginal desert lands unlike wild and feral horses wild donkeys in dry areas are solitary and do not form harems each adult donkey establishes a home range breeding over a large area may be dominated by one jack the loud call or bray of the donkey which typically lasts for twenty seconds and can be heard for over three kilometres may help keep in contact with other donkeys over the wide spaces of the desert donkeys have large ears which may pick up more distant sounds and may help cool the donkey blood donkeys can defend themselves by biting striking with the front hooves or kicking with the hind legs breeding a jenny is normally pregnant for about months though the gestation period varies from to months and usually gives birth to a single foal births of twins are rare though less so than in horses about percent of donkey pregnancies result in twins both foals survive in about percent of those in general jennies have a conception rate that is lower than that of horses ie less than the rate for mares although jennies come into heat within or days of giving birth their fertility remains low and it is likely the reproductive tract has not returned to normal thus it is usual to wait one or two further oestrous cycles before rebreeding unlike the practice with mares jennies are usually very protective of their foals and some will not come into estrus while they have a foal at side the time lapse involved in rebreeding and the length of a jenny gestation means that a jenny will have fewer than one foal per year because of this and the longer gestation period donkey breeders do not expect to obtain a foal every year as horse breeders often do but may plan for three foals in four yearsdonkeys can interbreed with other members of the family equidae and are commonly interbred with horses the hybrid between a jack and a mare is a mule valued as a working and riding animal in many countries some large donkey breeds such as the asino di martina franca the baudet de poitou and the mammoth jack are raised only for mule production the hybrid between a stallion and a jenny is a hinny and is less common like other hybrids mules and hinnies are usually sterile donkeys can also breed with zebras in which the offspring is called a zonkey among other names behaviour donkeys have a notorious reputation for stubbornness but this has been attributed to a much stronger sense of than exhibited by horses likely based on a stronger prey instinct and a weaker connection with humans it is considerably more difficult to force or frighten a donkey into doing something it perceives to be dangerous for whatever reason once a person has earned their confidence they can be willing and companionable partners and very dependable in workalthough formal studies of their behaviour and cognition are rather limited donkeys appear to be quite intelligent cautious friendly playful and eager to learn history the genus equus which includes all extant equines is believed to have evolved from dinohippus via the intermediate form plesippus one of the oldest species is equus simplicidens described as with a head the oldest fossil to date is million years old from idaho usa the genus appears to have spread quickly into the old world with the similarly aged equus livenzovensis documented from western europe and russiamolecular phylogenies indicate the most recent common ancestor of all modern equids members of the genus equus lived mya direct paleogenomic sequencing of a middle pleistocene horse metapodial bone from canada implies a more recent myr before present date for the most recent common ancestor mrca within the range of to myr bp the oldest divergencies are the asian hemiones subgenus e asinus including the kulan onager and kiang followed by the african zebras subgenera e dolichohippus and e hippotigris all other modern forms including the domesticated horse and many fossil pliocene and pleistocene forms belong to the subgenus e equus which diverged million years ago the ancestors of the modern donkey are the nubian and somalian subspecies of african wild ass remains of domestic donkeys dating to the fourth millennium bc have been found in in lower egypt and it is believed that the domestication of the donkey was accomplished long after the domestication of cattle sheep and goats in the seventh and eighth millennia bc donkeys were probably first domesticated by pastoral people in nubia and they supplanted the ox as the chief pack animal of that culture the domestication of donkeys served to increase the mobility of pastoral cultures having the advantage over ruminants of not needing time to chew their cud and were vital in the development of trade across egypt in the dynasty iv era of egypt between and bc wealthy members of society were known to own over donkeys employed in agriculture as dairy and meat animals and as pack animals in the tomb of either king narmer or king two of the first egyptian pharaohs was excavated and the skeletons of ten donkeys were found buried in a manner usually used with high ranking humans these burials show the importance of donkeys to the early egyptian state and its ruler by the end of the fourth millennium bc the donkey had spread to southwest asia and the main breeding center had shifted to mesopotamia by bc the breeding of large white riding asses made damascus famous while syrian breeders developed at least three other breeds including one preferred by women for its easy gait the muscat or yemen ass was developed in arabia by the second millennium bc the donkey was brought to europe possibly at the same time as viticulture was introduced as the donkey is associated with the syrian god of wine dionysus greeks spread both of these to many of their colonies including those in what are now italy france and spain romans dispersed them throughout their empirethe first donkeys came to the americas on ships of the second voyage of christopher columbus and were landed at hispaniola in the first to reach north america may have been two animals taken to mexico by juan de zumarraga the first bishop of mexico who arrived there on december while the first donkeys to reach what is now the united states may have crossed the rio grande with juan de onate in april from that time on they spread northward finding use in missions and mines donkeys were documented as present in what today is arizona in by the gold rush years of the century the burro was the beast of burden of choice of early prospectors in the western united states with the end of the placer mining boom many of them escaped or were abandoned and a feral population established itself present status about million donkeys were reported worldwide in china had the most with million followed by pakistan ethiopia and mexico as of however the chinese population was reported to have dropped to million with african populations under pressure as well due to increasing trade and demand for donkey products in china some researchers believe the actual number may be somewhat higher since many donkeys go uncounted the number of breeds and percentage of world population for each of the fao world regions was in in the number of donkeys in the world was reported to be continuing to grow as it had steadily done throughout most of history factors cited as contributing to this were increasing human population progress in economic development and social stability in some poorer nations conversion of forests to farm and range land rising prices of motor vehicles and fuel and the popularity of donkeys as pets since then the world population of donkeys is reported to be rapidly shrinking falling from million to million between and and to only million in the fall in population is pronounced in developed countries in europe the total number of donkeys fell from million in to just over million in domestic animal diversity information system of the fao listed breeds of ass in june in the number of breeds of donkey recorded worldwide was and in it was the rapid increase is attributed to attention paid to identification and recognition of donkey breeds by the fao animal genetic resources project the rate of recognition of new breeds has been particularly high in some developed countries in france for example only one breed the baudet de poitou was recognised prior to the early by a further six donkey breeds had official recognitionin prosperous countries the welfare of donkeys both at home and abroad has become a concern and a number of sanctuaries for retired and rescued donkeys have been set up the largest is the donkey sanctuary near sidmouth england which also supports donkey welfare projects in egypt ethiopia india kenya and mexico uses economic use the donkey has been used as a working animal for at least years of the more than million donkeys in the world about are in underdeveloped countries where they are used principally as pack animals or for draught work in transport or agriculture after human labour the donkey is the cheapest form of agricultural power they may also be ridden or used for threshing raising water milling and other work working donkeys are often associated with those living at or below subsistence levels some cultures that prohibit women from working with oxen in agriculture do not extend this taboo to donkeys allowing them to be used by both sexesin developed countries where their use as beasts of burden has disappeared donkeys are used to sire mules to guard sheep for donkey rides for children or tourists and as pets donkeys may be pastured or stabled with horses and ponies and are thought to have a calming effect on nervous horses if a donkey is introduced to a mare and foal the foal may turn to the donkey for support after it has been weaned from its mothera few donkeys are milked or raised for meat approximately million donkeys and mules are slaughtered each year for meat worldwide in italy which has the highest consumption of equine meat in europe and where donkey meat is the main ingredient of several regional dishes about donkeys were slaughtered in yielding approximately tonnes of meat asses milk may command good prices the average price in italy in was per litre and a price of per ml was reported from croatia in it is used for soaps and cosmetics as well as dietary purposes the niche markets for both milk and meat are expanding in the past donkey skin was used in the production of parchment in the uk based charity the donkey sanctuary estimated that million skins were traded every year but the demand could be as high as millionin china donkey meat is considered a delicacy with some restaurants specializing in such dishes and guo li zhuang restaurants offer the genitals of donkeys in dishes gelatin is produced by soaking and stewing the hide to make a traditional chinese medicine product ejiao the gelatine produced by boiling donkey skins can sell for up to per kilo at october pricesin a drop in the number of chinese donkeys combined with the fact that they are slow to reproduce meant that chinese suppliers began to look to africa as a result of the increase in demand and the price that could be charged kenya opened three donkey abattoirs concerns for donkeys however have resulted in a number of african countries including uganda tanzania botswana niger burkina faso mali and senegal banning china from buying their donkey productsin the donkey sanctuary warned that the global donkey population could be reduced by half over the next half decade as the demand for ejiao increases in china in warfare during world war i john simpson kirkpatrick a british stretcher bearer serving with the australian and new zealand army corps and richard alexander dick henderson of the new zealand medical corps used donkeys to rescue wounded soldiers from the battlefield at gallipoliaccording to british food writer matthew fort donkeys were used in the italian army the mountain fusiliers each had a donkey to carry their gear and in extreme circumstances the animal could be eatendonkeys have also been used to carry explosives in conflicts that include the war in afghanistan and others care shoeing donkey hooves are more elastic than those of horses and do not naturally wear down as fast regular clipping may be required neglect can lead to permanent damage working donkeys may need to be shod donkey shoes are similar to horseshoes but usually smaller and without nutrition in their native arid and climates donkeys spend more than half of each day foraging and feeding often on poor quality scrub the donkey has a tough digestive system in which roughage is efficiently broken down by hind gut fermentation microbial action in the caecum and large intestine while there is no marked structural difference between the tract of a donkey and that of a horse the digestion of the donkey is more efficient it needs less food than a horse or pony of comparable height and weight approximately percent of body weight per day in dry matter compared to the percent consumption rate possible for a horse donkeys are also less prone to colic the reasons for this difference are not fully understood the donkey may have different intestinal flora to the horse or a longer gut retention time donkeys obtain most of their energy from structural carbohydrates some suggest that a donkey needs to be fed only straw preferably barley straw supplemented with controlled grazing in the summer or hay in the winter to get all the energy protein fat and vitamins it requires others recommend some grain to be fed particularly to working animals and others advise against feeding straw they do best when allowed to consume small amounts of food over long periods they can meet their nutritional needs on to hours of grazing per day on average dryland pasture that is not stressed by drought if they are worked long hours or do not have access to pasture they require hay or a similar dried forage with no more than a ratio of legumes to grass they also require salt and mineral supplements and access to clean fresh water in temperate climates the forage available is often too abundant and too rich may cause weight gain and obesity and lead to metabolic disorders such as founder laminitis and hyperlipaemia or to gastric ulcersthroughout the world working donkeys are associated with the very poor with those living at or below subsistence level few receive adequate food and in general donkeys throughout the third world are and burro in the iberian peninsula and hispanic america a burro is a small donkey burro is the spanish word for donkey the domestic animal diversity information system of the fao lists the burro as a specific breed of ass in mexico the donkey population is estimated at three million there are also substantial burro populations in el salvador guatemala and nicaragua burro is the spanish and portuguese word for donkey in spanish burros may also be called burro mexicano donkey burro criollo donkey or burro criollo mexicano in the united states burro is used as a loan word by english speakers to describe any small donkey used primarily as a pack animal as well as to describe the feral donkeys that live in arizona california oregon utah texas and nevadaamong donkeys burros tend to be on the small side a study of working burros in central mexico found a weight range of kilograms lb with an average weight of kg lb for males and kg lb for females height at the withers varied from cm in with an average of approximately cm in and girth measurements ranged from cm in with an average of about cm in the average age of the burros in the study was years evaluated by their teeth they ranged from to years old they are gray in color mexican burros tend to be smaller than their counterparts in the us which are both larger and more robust to strengthen their bloodstock in may the state of jalisco imported male and female donkeys from kentucky feral donkeys and wild asses in some areas domestic donkeys have returned to the wild and established feral populations such as those of the burro of north america and the asinara donkey of sardinia italy both of which have protected status feral donkeys can also cause problems notably in environments that have evolved free of any form of equid such as hawaii in australia where there may be million feral donkeys they are regarded as an invasive pest and have a serious impact on the environment they may compete with livestock and native animals for resources spread weeds and diseases foul or damage watering holes and cause erosion wild asses onagers and kiangs few species of ass exist in the wild the african wild ass equus africanus has two subspecies the somali wild ass equus africanus somaliensis and the nubian wild ass equus africanus africanus the principal ancestor of the domestic donkey both are critically endangered extinct species include the european ass equus hydruntinus which became extinct during the neolithic and the north african wild ass equus africanus atlanticus which became extinct in roman timesthere are five subspecies of asiatic wild ass or onager equus hemionus and three subspecies of the kiang equus kiang of the himalayan upland donkey hybrids a male donkey jack can be crossed with a female horse to produce a mule a male horse can be crossed with a female donkey jenny to produce a hinny hybrids are almost always sterile because horses have chromosomes whereas donkeys have producing offspring with chromosomes mules are much more common than hinnies this is believed to be caused by two factors the first being proven in cat hybrids that when the chromosome count of the male is the higher fertility rates drop the lower progesterone production of the jenny may also lead to early embryonic loss in addition there are reasons not directly related to reproductive biology due to different mating behavior jacks are often more willing to cover mares than stallions are to breed jennies further mares are usually larger than jennies and thus have more room for the ensuing foal to grow in the womb resulting in a larger animal at birth it is commonly believed that mules are more easily handled and also physically stronger than hinnies making them more desirable for breeders to producethe offspring of a cross is called a zonkey zebroid zebrass or zedonk zebra mule is an older term but still used in some regions today the foregoing terms generally refer to hybrids produced by breeding a male zebra to a female donkey zebra hinny zebret and zebrinny all refer to the cross of a female zebra with a male donkey zebrinnies are rarer than zedonkies because female zebras in captivity are most valuable when used to produce zebras there are not enough female zebras breeding in captivity to spare them for hybridizing there is no such limitation on the number of female
