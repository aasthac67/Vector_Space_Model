the caracal caracal caracal is a wild cat native to africa the middle east central asia and india it is characterised by a robust build long legs a short face long tufted ears and long canine teeth its coat is uniformly reddish tan or sandy while the ventral parts are lighter with small reddish markings it reaches cm in at the shoulder and weighs kg lb it was first scientifically described by german naturalist johann christian daniel von schreber in three subspecies are recognised typically nocturnal the caracal is highly secretive and difficult to observe it is territorial and lives mainly alone or in pairs the caracal is a carnivore that typically preys upon small mammals birds and rodents it can leap higher than metres ft and catch birds in midair it stalks its prey until it is within m ft of it after which it runs it down and kills its prey with a bite to the throat or to the back of the neck both sexes become sexually mature by the time they are one year old and breed throughout the year gestation lasts between two and three months resulting in a litter of one to six kittens juveniles leave their mothers at the age of nine to ten months though a few females stay back with their mothers the average lifespan of captive caracals is nearly years caracals were tamed and used for hunting in ancient egypt taxonomy and phylogeny felis caracal was the scientific name used by johann christian daniel von schreber in who described a caracal skin from the cape of good hope in british zoologist john edward gray placed it in the genus caracal it is placed in the family felidae and subfamily felinaein the and centuries several caracal specimens were described and proposed as subspecies since three subspecies are recognised as valid southern caracal c c caracal schreber occurs in southern and east africa northern caracal c c nubicus fischer occurs in north and west africa asiatic caracal c c schmitzi matschie occurs in asia phylogeny results of a phylogenetic study indicates that the caracal and the african golden cat caracal aurata diverged between and million years ago these two species together with the serval leptailurus serval form the caracal lineage which diverged between and million years ago the ancestor of this lineage arrived in africa between and million years agothe relationship of the caracal is considered as follows etymology the name was proposed by georges buffon in who referred to its turkish name or meaning with black ears the of the greeks and romans was most probably the caracal and the name is sometimes still applied to it but the lynx proper is a separate genusthe caracal is also known as desert lynx and persian lynx local names its name in the tigrinya language is cheke 'aanebasaa ch ok anbessa which means lion characteristics the caracal is a slender moderately sized cat characterised by a robust build a short face long canine teeth tufted ears and long legs it reaches nearly cm in at the shoulder the tan bushy tail extends to the hocks the caracal is sexually dimorphic the females are smaller than the males in most bodily parametersthe prominent facial features include the black tufts on the ears two black stripes from the forehead to the nose the black outline of the mouth the distinctive black facial markings and the white patches surrounding the eyes and the mouth the eyes appear to be narrowly open due to the lowered upper eyelid probably an adaptation to shield the eyes from the sun glare the ear tufts may start drooping as the animal ages the coat is uniformly reddish tan or sandy though black caracals are also known the underbelly and the insides of the legs are lighter often with small reddish markings the fur soft short and dense grows coarser in the summer the ground hairs the basal layer of hair covering the coat are denser in winter than in summer the length of the guard hairs the hair extending above the ground hairs can be up to cm in long in winter but shorten to cm in in summer these features indicate the onset of moulting in the hot season typically in october and november the hind legs are longer than the forelegs so the body appears to be sloping downward from the rumpmale caracals measure in length cm in and have cm in long tails male caracals ranged in weight between and kg and lb the length of females is cm in with a tail of cm in females ranged in weight between and kg and lb the caracal is often confused with the lynx as both cats have tufted ears however a notable point of difference between the two is that the lynx is spotted and blotched while the caracal shows no such markings on the coat the african golden cat has a similar build as the caracal but is darker and lacks the ear tufts the sympatric serval can be distinguished from the caracal by the former lack of ear tufts white spots behind the ears spotted coat longer legs longer tail and smaller footprintsthe skull of the caracal is high and rounded featuring large auditory bullae a supraoccipital crest normal to the sagittal crest and a strong lower jaw the caracal has a total of teeth the dental formula is the deciduous dentition is the striking canines are up to cm in long heavy and sharp these are used to give the killing bite to the prey the caracal lacks the second upper premolars and the upper molars are diminutive the large paws similar to those of the cheetah consist of four digits in the hind legs and five in the fore legs the first digit of the fore leg remains above the ground and features the dewclaw the claws sharp and retractable able to be drawn in are larger but less curved in the hind legs distribution and habitat in africa the caracal is widely distributed south of the sahara but considered rare in north africa in asia it occurs from the arabian peninsula middle east turkmenistan uzbekistan to western india it inhabits forests savannas marshy lowlands semideserts and scrub forests but prefers dry areas with low rainfall and availability of cover in montane habitats such as the ethiopian highlands it occurs up to an altitude of m ft in ethiopia degua tembien massif they can be seen along roads sometimes as road killsin the emirate of abu dhabi a male caracal was recorded by in jebel hafeet national park in the region abu dhabi in february the first such record since uzbekistan caracals were recorded only in the desert regions of the ustyurt plateau and kyzylkum desert between and individuals were sighted alive and at least were killed by herdersin iran the caracal has been recorded in abbasabad naein reserve bahram gur protected area kavir national park and in yazd provincein india the caracal occurs in sariska tiger reserve and ranthambhore tiger reserve ecology and behaviour the caracal is typically nocturnal active at night though some activity may be observed during the day as well however the cat is so secretive and difficult to observe that its activity at daytime might easily go unnoticed a study in south africa showed that caracals are most active when the air temperature drops below activity typically ceases at higher temperatures a solitary cat the caracal mainly occurs alone or in pairs the only groups seen are of mothers with their offspring females in oestrus temporarily pair with males a territorial animal the caracal marks rocks and vegetation in its territory with urine and probably with dung which is not covered with soil claw scratching is prominent and dung middens are typically not formed in israel males are found to have territories averaging sq mi while that of females averaged sq mi the male territories vary from sq mi in saudi arabia in mountain zebra national park the home ranges of females vary between and and sq mi these territories overlap extensively the conspicuous ear tufts and the facial markings often serve as a method of visual communication caracals have been observed interacting with each other by moving the head from side to side so that the tufts flicker rapidly like other cats the caracal meows growls hisses spits and purrs diet and hunting a carnivore the caracal typically preys upon small mammals birds and rodents studies in south africa have reported that it preys on the cape grysbok the common duiker sheep goats bush vlei rats rock hyraxes hares and birds a study in western india showed that rodents comprise a significant portion of the diet they will feed from a variety of sources but tend to focus on the most abundant one grasses and grapes are taken occasionally to clear their immune system and stomach of any parasites larger antelopes such as young kudu bushbuck impala mountain reedbuck and springbok may also be targeted mammals generally comprise at least of the diet lizards snakes and insects are infrequently eaten in south africa caracals have been documented preying on small livestock in areas where sheep and goat are farmed livestock is however only a small and seasonal portion of their diet when wild prey is scarceits speed and agility make it an efficient hunter able to take down prey two to three times its size the powerful hind legs allow it to leap more than m ft in the air to catch birds on the wing it can even twist and change its direction it is an adroit climber it stalks its prey until it is within m ft following which it can launch into a sprint while large prey such as antelopes are suffocated by a throat bite smaller prey are killed by a bite on the back of the neck kills are consumed immediately and less commonly dragged to cover it returns to large kills if undisturbed it has been observed to begin feeding on antelope kills at the hind parts it may scavenge at times though this has not been frequently observed it often has to compete with foxes wolves leopards and hyaena for prey reproduction both sexes become sexually mature by the time they are a year old production of gametes begins even earlier at seven to ten months however successful mating takes place only at to months breeding takes place throughout the year oestrus one to three days long recurs every two weeks unless the female is pregnant females in oestrus show a spike in and form temporary pairs with males mating has not been extensively studied a limited number of observations suggest that copulation that lasts nearly four minutes on an average begins with the male smelling the areas by the female which rolls on the ground following this he approaches and mounts the female the pair separate after copulationgestation lasts about two to three months following which a litter consisting of one to six kittens is born births generally peak from october to february births take place in dense vegetation or deserted burrows of aardvarks and porcupines kittens are born with their eyes and ears shut and the claws not retractable unable to be drawn inside the coat resembles that of adults but the abdomen is spotted eyes open by ten days but it takes longer for the vision to become normal the ears become erect and the claws become retractable by the third or the fourth week around the same time the kittens start roaming their birthplace and start playing among themselves by the fifth or the sixth week they begin taking solid food around the same time they have to wait for nearly three months before they make their first kill as the kittens start moving about by themselves the mother starts shifting them every day all the milk teeth appear in days and permanent dentition is completed in months juveniles begin dispersing at nine to ten months though a few females stay back with their mothers the average lifespan of the caracal in captivity is nearly yearsin the a captive caracal spontaneously mated with a domestic cat in the moscow zoo resulting in a felid hybrid offspring threats the caracal is listed as least concern on the iucn red list since as it is widely distributed in over range countries where the threats to caracal populations vary in extent habitat loss due to agricultural expansion the building of roads and settlements is a major threat in all range countries it is thought to be close to extinction in north africa critically endangered in pakistan endangered in jordan but stable in central and southern africa local people kill caracal to protect livestock or in retaliation for its preying on small livestock additionally it is threatened by hunting for the pet trade on the arabian peninsula in turkey and iran caracals are frequently killed in road accidents in uzbekistan the major threat to caracal is killing by herders in retaliation for livestock losses guarding techniques and sheds are inadequate to protect small livestock like goats and sheep from being attacked by predators additionally similarly to ethiopia roads crossing caracal habitat pose a potential threat for the species conservation african caracal populations are listed under cites appendix ii while asian populations come under cites appendix i hunting of caracal is prohibited in afghanistan algeria egypt india iran israel jordan kazakhstan lebanon morocco pakistan syria tajikistan tunisia turkey turkmenistan and uzbekistan caracals occur in a number of protected areas across their rangein south africa the caracal is considered least concern as it is widespread and adaptable to a variety of habitats it is tolerant to areas although it has been persecuted for many decades farmers are encouraged to report sightings of caracals both dead and alive as well as livestock killed by caracals to the national predation management information centrethe central asian caracal population is listed as critically endangered in uzbekistan since and in kazakhstan since in culture chinese emperors used caracals as gifts in the and the centuries yuan dynasty rulers bought numerous caracals cheetahs and tigers from muslim merchants in the western parts of the empire in return for gold silver cash and silk according to the ming shilu the subsequent ming dynasty continued this practice until as recently as the century the caracal was used in hunts by indian rulers to hunt small game while the cheetah was used for larger game in those times caracals were exposed to a flock of pigeons and people would bet on which caracal would kill the largest number of pigeons this probably gave rise to the expression to put the cat among the pigeons the caracal appears to have been religiously significant in the ancient egyptian culture as it occurs in paintings and as bronze figurines sculptures are thought to have guarded the tombs of pharaohs embalmed caracals have also been discovered its pelt was used for making fur coats references external links caracal iucn cat specialist group caracal
