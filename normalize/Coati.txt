coatis also known as coatimundis are members of the family procyonidae in the genera nasua and nasuella they are diurnal mammals native to south america central america mexico and the southwestern united states the name coatimundi purportedly derives from the tupian languages of brazilthe coati is also known in english as the coon physical characteristics adult coatis measure to cm to in from head to the base of the tail which can be as long as their bodies coatis are about cm in tall at the shoulder and weigh between and kg and lb about the size of a large house cat males can become almost twice as large as females and have large sharp canine teeth the above measurements are for the and south america coatis the two mountain coatis are smallerall coatis share a slender head with an elongated flexible slightly nose small ears dark feet and a long tail used for balance and signaling coatis have either a light brown or black coat with a lighter and a tail in most cases coatis have a long brown tail with rings on it which are anywhere from starkly defined like a raccoon to very faint like raccoons and unlike cats and cacomistles the rings go completely around the tail coatis often hold the tail erect it is used as such to keep troops of coatis together in tall vegetation the tip of the tail can be moved slightly on its own as is the case with cats but it is not prehensile as is that of the kinkajou another procyonid coatis have and paws and walk plantigrade on the soles of the feet as do humans like raccoons and bears coatis have nonretractable claws coatis also are in common with raccoons and other procyonids and others in the order carnivora and rare cases amongst other mammals able to rotate their ankles beyond they are therefore able to descend trees head first other animals living in forests have acquired some or all of these properties through convergent evolution including members of the mongoose civet weasel cat and bear families the coati snout is long and somewhat see suidae part of the reason for its nickname raccoon it is also extremely flexible it can be rotated up to in any direction they use their noses to push objects and rub parts of their body the facial markings include white markings around the eyes and on the ears and snout coatis have strong limbs to climb and dig and have a reputation for intelligence like their fellow procyonid the raccoon they prefer to sleep or rest in elevated places and niches like the rainforest canopy in crudely built sleeping nests coatis are active day and night habitat and range overall coatis are widespread occupying habitats ranging from hot and arid areas to humid amazonian rainforests or even cold andean mountain slopes including grasslands and bushy areas their geographical range extends from the southwestern us southern arizona new mexico and texas through northern uruguay around ten coatis are thought to have formed a breeding population in cumbria uk taxonomy the following species are recognized genus nasua nasua narica linnaeus coati southwestern united states mexico central america and colombia nasua nasua linnaeus south american coati south america genus nasuella nasuella meridensis thomas eastern mountain coati venezuela nasuella olivacea gray western mountain coati colombia and ecuador the cozumel island coati was formerly recognized as a species but the vast majority of recent authorities treat it as a subspecies n narica nelsoni of the coatigenetic evidence cytochrome b sequences has suggested that the genus nasuella should be merged into nasua as the latter is otherwise paraphyletic other genetic studies have shown that the closest relatives of the coatis are the olingos genus bassaricyon the two lineages are thought to have diverged about million years ago lifespan in the wild coatis live for about seven years while in captivity they can live for up to or years feeding habits coatis are omnivores their diet consists mainly of ground litter invertebrates such as tarantula and fruit et al hirsch they also eat small vertebrate prey such as lizards rodents small birds birds eggs and crocodile eggs the snout with an acute sense of smell assists the paws in a manner to unearth invertebrates behavior little is known about the behavior of the mountain coatis and the following is almost entirely about the coatis of the genus nasua unlike most members of the raccoon family procyonidae coatis are primarily diurnal nasua coati females and young males up to two years of age are gregarious and travel through their territories in noisy loosely organized bands made up of four to individuals foraging with their offspring on the ground or in the forest canopy males over two years become solitary due to behavioural disposition and collective aggression from the females and will join the female groups only during the breeding season when provoked or for defense coatis can be fierce fighters their strong jaws sharp canine teeth and fast scratching paws along with a tough hide sturdily attached to the underlying muscles make it very difficult for potential predators eg dogs or jaguars to seize the smaller mammal coatis communicate their intentions or moods with chirping snorting or grunting sounds different chirping sounds are used to express joy during social grooming appeasement after fights or to convey irritation or anger snorting while digging along with an erect tail states territorial or food claims during foraging coatis additionally use special postures or moves to convey simple messages for example hiding the nose between the front paws as a sign for submission lowering the head baring teeth and jumping at an enemy signal an aggressive disposition individuals recognize other coatis by their looks voices and smells the individual smell is intensified by special on their necks and bellies coatis from panama are known to rub their own fur and that of other troop members with resin from trattinnickia aspera burseraceae trees but its purpose is unclear some proposed possibilities are it serves as an insect repellent a fungicide or as a form of reproduction coati breeding season mainly corresponds with the start of the rainy season to coincide with maximum availability of food especially fruits between january and march in some areas and between october and february in others during the breeding season an adult male is accepted into the band of females and juveniles near the beginning of the breeding season leading to a polygynous mating system the pregnant females separate from the group build a nest on a tree or in a rocky niche and after a gestation period of about weeks give birth to litters of three to seven kits about six weeks after birth the females and their young will rejoin the band females become sexually mature at two years of age while males will acquire sexual maturity at three years of age natural predators coati predators include jaguarundis anacondas maned wolves boa constrictors foxes dogs tayras ocelots and jaguars large raptors such as ornate eagles and harpy eagles also are known to hunt them capuchin monkeys hunt their pups status coatis face unregulated hunting and the serious threat of environmental destruction in central and south america the absence of scientifically sound population studies of nasua or nasuella in the wild is probably leading to a severe underestimation of the ecological problems and decline in numbers affecting the species in captivity coatis are one of five groups of procyonids commonly kept as pets in various parts of north central and south america the others being the raccoons common and the kinkajou the cat and cacomistle however while both the and south america coatis are common in captivity mountain coatis are extremely rare in captivitycoatis are small creatures that can be wild somewhat difficult to control or train in some cases and generally behave in a manner radically different from that of a pet dog optimally they should have a spacious outdoor enclosure and a room in the house other place as well they can be given the run of the house but need careful watching more careful in some cases than others it is possible to litter or toilet train coatis if one can not be trained as such it is still possible to lessen problems in that they tend to designate a latrine area which can have a litter pan placed in it as is done with many ferrets pet skunks rabbits and rodents coatis generally need both dog and cat vaccines for distemper and many other diseases and a killed rabies vaccine they can be spayed or neutered for the same reason as cats and dogs and other pets gallery references external links media related to nasua at wikimedia commons the dictionary definition of
