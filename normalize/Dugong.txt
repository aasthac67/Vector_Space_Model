the dugong dugong dugon is a marine mammal it is one of four living species of the order sirenia which also includes three species of manatees it is the only living representative of the family dugongidae its closest modern relative steller sea cow hydrodamalis gigas was hunted to extinction in the century the dugong is the only strictly herbivorous marine mammal the dugong is the only sirenian in its range which spans the waters of some countries and territories throughout the pacific the dugong is largely dependent on seagrass communities for subsistence and is thus restricted to the coastal habitats which support seagrass meadows with the largest dugong concentrations typically occurring in wide shallow protected areas such as bays mangrove channels the waters of large inshore islands and waters the northern waters of australia between shark bay and moreton bay are believed to be the dugong contemporary stronghold like all modern sirenians the dugong has a fusiform body with no dorsal fin or hind limbs the forelimbs or flippers are the dugong is easily distinguished from the manatees by its fluked tail but also possesses a unique skull and teeth its snout is sharply downturned an adaptation for feeding in benthic seagrass communities the molar teeth are simple and unlike the more elaborate molar dentition of manatees the dugong has been hunted for thousands of years for its meat and oil traditional hunting still has great cultural significance in several countries in its modern range particularly northern australia and the pacific islands the dugong current distribution is fragmented and many populations are believed to be close to extinction the iucn lists the dugong as a species vulnerable to extinction while the convention on international trade in endangered species limits or bans the trade of derived products despite being legally protected in many countries the main causes of population decline remain anthropogenic and include fatalities habitat degradation and hunting with its long lifespan of years or more and slow rate of reproduction the dugong is especially vulnerable to extinction evolution dugongs are part of the sirenia order of placental mammals which comprises modern sea cows manatees as well as dugongs and their extinct relatives sirenia are the only extant herbivorous marine mammals and the only group of herbivorous mammals to have become completely aquatic sirenians are thought to have a fossil record early they attained modest diversity during the oligocene and miocene but subsequently declined as a result of climatic cooling oceanographic changes and human interference etymology and taxonomy the word dugong derives from the visayan probably cebuano dugung the name was first adopted and popularized by the french naturalist leclerc comte de buffon as dugon in histoire naturelle after descriptions of the animal from the island of leyte in the philippines other common local names include sea cow sea pig and sea camel dugong dugon is the only extant species of the family dugongidae and one of only four extant species of the sirenia order the others forming the manatee family it was first classified by muller in as trichechus dugon a member of the manatee genus previously defined by linnaeus it was later assigned as the type species of dugong by lacepede and further classified within its own family by gray and subfamily by simpsondugongs and other sirenians are not closely related to other marine mammals being more related to elephants dugongs and elephants share a monophyletic group with hyraxes and the aardvark one of the earliest offshoots of eutherians the fossil record shows sirenians appearing in the eocene where they most likely lived in the tethys ocean the two extant families of sirenians are thought to have diverged in the after which the dugongs and their closest relative the steller sea cow split off from a common ancestor in the miocene the steller sea cow became extinct in the century no fossils exist of other members of the dugongidaemolecular studies have been made on dugong populations using mitochondrial dna the results have suggested that the population of southeast asia is distinct from the others australia has two distinct maternal lineages one of which also contains the dugongs from africa and arabia limited genetic mixing has taken place between those in southeast asia and those in australia mostly around timor one of the lineages stretches all the way from moreton bay to western australia while the other only stretches from moreton bay to the northern territory there is not yet sufficient genetic data to make clear boundaries between distinct groups anatomy and morphology the dugong body is large with a cylindrical shape that tapers at both ends it has thick smooth skin that is a pale cream colour at birth but darkens dorsally and laterally to with age the colour of a dugong can change due to the growth of algae on the skin the body is sparsely covered in short hair a common feature among sirenians which may allow for tactile interpretation of their environment these hairs are most developed around the mouth which has a large upper lip forming a highly mobile muzzle this muscular upper lip aids the dugong in foraging the dugong tail flukes and flippers are similar to those of dolphins these flukes are raised up and down in long strokes to move the animal forward and can be twisted to turn the forelimbs are flippers which aid in turning and slowing the dugong lacks nails on its flippers which are only of a dugong body length the tail has deep notchesa dugong brain weighs a maximum of g oz about of the animal body weight with very small eyes dugongs have limited vision but acute hearing within narrow sound thresholds their ears which lack pinnae are located on the sides of their head the nostrils are located on top of the head and can be closed using valves dugongs have two teats one located behind each flipper there are few differences between sexes the body structures are almost the same a male testes are not externally located and the main difference between males and females is the location of the genital aperture in relation to the umbilicus and the anus the lungs in a dugong are very long extending almost as far as the kidneys which are also highly elongated in order to cope with the saltwater environment if the dugong is wounded its blood will clot rapidly the skull of a dugong is unique the skull is enlarged with sharply premaxilla which are stronger in males the spine has between and vertebrae unlike in manatees the dugong teeth do not continually grow back via horizontal tooth replacement the dugong has two incisors tusks which emerge in males during puberty the female tusks continue to grow without emerging during puberty sometimes erupting later in life after reaching the base of the premaxilla the number of growth layer groups in a tusk indicates the age of a dugong and the cheekteeth move forward with age the full dental formula of dugongs is meaning they have two incisors three premolars and three molars on each side of their upper jaw and three incisors one canine three premolars and three molars on each side of their lower jaw like other sirenians the dugong experiences pachyostosis a condition in which the ribs and other long bones are unusually solid and contain little or no marrow these heavy bones which are among the densest in the animal kingdom may act as a ballast to help keep sirenians suspended slightly below the water surfacean adult length rarely exceeds metres ft an individual this long is expected to weigh around kilograms lb weight in adults is typically more than kilograms lb and less than kilograms lb the largest individual recorded was metres ft long and weighed kilograms lb and was found off the saurashtra coast of west india females tend to be larger than males distribution and habitat dugongs are found in warm coastal waters from the western pacific ocean to the eastern coast of africa along an estimated kilometres mi of coastline between and degrees to the north and south of the equator their historic range is believed to correspond to that of seagrasses from the potamogetonaceae and hydrocharitaceae families the full size of the former range is unknown although it is believed that the current populations represent the historical limits of the range which is highly fractured today populations of dugongs are found in the waters of countries and territories recorded numbers of dugongs are generally believed to be lower than actual numbers due to a lack of accurate surveys despite this the dugong population is thought to be shrinking with a worldwide decline of percent in the last years they have disappeared from the waters of hong kong mauritius and taiwan as well as parts of cambodia japan the philippines and vietnam further disappearances are likelydugongs are generally found in warm waters around the coast with large numbers concentrated in wide and shallow protected bays the dugong is the only strictly marine herbivorous mammal as all species of manatee utilise fresh water to some degree nonetheless they can tolerate the brackish waters found in coastal wetlands and large numbers are also found in wide and shallow mangrove channels and around leeward sides of large inshore islands where seagrass beds are common they are usually located at a depth of around m ft although in areas where the continental shelf remains shallow dugongs have been known to travel more than kilometres mi from the shore descending to as far as metres ft where deepwater seagrasses such as halophila spinulosa are found special habitats are used for different activities it has been observed that shallow waters are used as sites for calving minimizing the risk of predation deep waters may provide a thermal refuge from cooler waters closer to the shore during winter australia australia is home to the largest population stretching from shark bay in western australia to moreton bay in queensland the population of shark bay is thought to be stable with over dugongs smaller populations exist up the coast including one in ashmore reef large numbers of dugongs live to the north of the northern territory with a population of over in the gulf of carpentaria alone a population of over exists in the torres strait such as off thursday island although there is significant migration between the strait and the waters of new guinea the great barrier reef provides important feeding areas for the species this reef area houses a stable population of around although the population concentration has shifted over time large bays facing north on the queensland coast provide significant habitats for dugong with the southernmost of these being hervey bay and moreton bay dugongs had been occasional visitors along the gold coast where a of a local population through range expansions has started recently persian gulf the persian gulf has the dugong population in the world inhabiting most of the southern coast and the current population is believed to range from to in the course of a study being carried out in and on the persian gulf the largest reported group sighting was made of more than individuals to the west of qatar however recent studies revealed severe declines both in population size and distributions among the region a study for instance found a nearly drop in population since reasons for this drastic population loss include illegal poaching oil spills and net entanglement east africa and south asia in the late herds of up to dugongs were observed off the coast of east africa and nearby islands current populations in this area are extremely small numbering and below and it is thought likely they will become extinct the eastern side of the red sea is home to large populations numbering in the hundreds and similar populations are thought to exist on the western side in the it was estimated there could be as many as dugongs in the red sea dugong populations in madagascar are poorly studied but due to widespread exploitation it is thought they may have severely declined with few surviving individuals in mozambique most of the remaining local populations are very small and the largest about individuals occurs at bazaruto island but they have become rare in historical habitats such as in maputo bay and on inhaca island in tanzania observations have recently been increased around the mafia island marine park where a hunt was intended by fishermen but failed in in the seychelles dugongs had been regarded as extinct in century until a small number was discovered around the aldabra atoll this population may belong to a different group than that distributed among the inner isles dugongs once thrived among the chagos archipelago and sea cow island was named after the species although the species no longer occurs in the regiona highly isolated breeding population exists in the marine national park gulf of kutch the only remaining population in western india it is kilometres mi from the population in the persian gulf and kilometres mi from the nearest population in india former populations in this area centered on the maldives and the laccadive islands are presumed to be extinct a population exists in the gulf of mannar marine national park and the palk strait between india and sri lanka but it is seriously depleted recoveries of seagrass beds along former ranges of dugongs such as the chilika lake have been confirmed in recent years raising hopes for of the species the population around the andaman and nicobar islands are known only from a few records and although the population was large during british rule it is now believed to be small and scattered once distributed throughout the coastal belt in sri lanka the dugong numbers have declined in last two decades southern pacific outside of australia a small population exists today along the southern coast of china where efforts are being made to protect it including the establishment of a seagrass sanctuary for dugong and other endangered marine fauna ranging in guangxi despite these efforts numbers continue to decrease and in it was reported that no more dugong could be found on the west coast of the island of hainan historically dugongs were also present in the southern parts of the yellow seain vietnam dugongs have been restricted mostly to the provinces of kien giang and ba tau including phu quoc island and con dao island which hosted large populations in the past con dao is now the only site in vietnam where dugong are regularly seen protected within the con dao national park nonetheless dangerously low levels of awarenesses for conservation of marine organisms in vietnam and cambodia may result in increased intentional or unintentional catches and illegal trade is a potential danger for local dugongs on phu quoc the first festival was held in aiming to raise awareness of these issuesin thailand the present distribution of dugongs is restricted to six provinces along the andaman sea and very few dugongs are present in the gulf of thailand the gulf of thailand was historically home to large number of the animals but none have been sighted in the west of the gulf in recent years and the remaining population in the east is thought to be very small and possibly declining dugongs are believed to exist in the straits of johor in very small numbers the waters around borneo support a small population with more scattered throughout the malay archipelagoall the islands of the philippines once provided habitats for sizeable herds of dugongs they were common until the when their numbers declined sharply due to accidental drownings in fishing gear and habitat destruction of seagrass meadows today only isolated populations survive most notably in the waters off the calamian islands in palawan isabela in luzon guimaras and mindanao the dugong became the first marine animal protected by philippine law with harsh penalties for harming them recently local marine trash problem in the archipelago remained unabated and became the biggest threat to the already dwindling population of dugongs in the country litters of plastic waste sachets plastic bottles jollibee containers etc and other materials abound in the coastal areas as these materials may be mistaken as food by dugongs these may lead to death due to plastic ingestion overpopulation and lack of education of all coastal fisherfolk in the philippines regarding marine trash are clearly harming the coastal environment not only in palawan but also across the islands of the philippinespopulations also exist around the solomon islands archipelago and new caledonia stretching to an easternmost population in vanuatu a highly isolated population lives around the islands of palaua single dugong lives at cocos keeling islands although the animal is thought to be a vagrant northern pacific today possibly the smallest and northernmost population of dugongs exists around the ryukyu islands and a population formerly existed off taiwan an endangered population of or fewer dugongs possibly as few as three individuals survives around okinawa new sightings of a pair have been reported in indicating a possible breeding had occurred in these waters a single individual was recorded at amami oshima at the northernmost edge of the dugong historic range more than years after the last previous recorded sighting a vagrant strayed into port near ushibuka kumamoto and died due to poor health historically the yaeyama islands held a large concentration of dugongs with more than individuals on aragusuku island large quantities of skulls are preserved at an utaki that outsiders are strictly forbidden to enter dugong populations in these areas were reduced by historical hunts as payments to the ryukyu kingdom before being wiped out because of illegal hunting and fishing using destructive methods such as dynamite fishing after the second world war populations around taiwan appear to be almost extinct although remnant individuals may visit areas with rich seagrass beds such as dongsha atoll some of the last reported sightings were made in kenting national park in the and there had been occasional records of vagrants at the northern mariana islands prior to it is unknown how much mixing there was between these populations historically some theorize that populations existed independently for example that the okinawan population were isolated members derived from the migration of a philippine subspecies others postulate that the populations formed part of a where migration between ryukyu taiwan and the philippines was common extinct mediterranean population it has been confirmed that dugongs once inhabited the water of the mediterranean possibly until after the rise of civilizations along the inland sea this population possibly shared ancestry with the red sea population and the mediterranean population had never been large due to geographical factors and climate changes the mediterranean is the region where the dugongidae originated in the eocene along with caribbean sea ecology and life history dugongs are and the oldest recorded specimen reached age they have few natural predators although animals such as crocodiles killer whales and sharks pose a threat to the young and a dugong has also been recorded to have died from trauma after being impaled by a stingray barb a large number of infections and parasitic diseases affect dugongs detected pathogens include helminths cryptosporidium different types of bacterial infections and other unidentified parasites of dugong deaths in queensland since are thought to be because of diseasealthough they are social animals they are usually solitary or found in pairs due to the inability of seagrass beds to support large populations gatherings of hundreds of dugongs sometimes happen but they last only for a short time because they are shy and do not approach humans little is known about dugong behavior they can go six minutes without breathing though about two and a half minutes is more typical and have been known to rest on their tail to breathe with their heads above water they can dive to a maximum depth of metres ft they spend most of their lives no deeper than metres ft communication between individuals is through chirps whistles barks and other sounds that echo underwater different sounds have been observed with different amplitudes and frequencies implying different purposes visual communication is limited due to poor eyesight and is mainly used for activities such as lekking for courtship purposes mothers and calves are in almost constant physical contact and calves have been known to reach out and touch their mothers with their flippers for reassurancedugongs are often traveling long distances in search of food but staying within a certain range their entire life large numbers often move together from one area to another it is thought that these movements are caused by changes in seagrass availability their memory allows them to return to specific points after long travels dugong movements mostly occur within a localized area of seagrass beds and animals in the same region show individualistic patterns of movement daily movement is affected by the tides in areas where there is a large tidal range dugongs travel with the tide in order to access shallower feeding areas in moreton bay dugongs often travel between foraging grounds inside the bay and warmer oceanic waters at higher latitudes dugongs make seasonal travels to reach warmer water during the winter occasionally individual dugongs make travels over many days and can travel over deep ocean waters one animal was seen as far south as sydney although they are marine creatures dugongs have been known to travel up creeks and in one case a dugong was caught kilometres mi up a creek near cooktown feeding dugongs along with other sirenians are referred to as sea cows because their diet consists mainly of when eating they ingest the whole plant including the roots although when this is impossible they will feed on just the leaves a wide variety of seagrass has been found in dugong stomach contents and evidence exists they will eat algae when seagrass is scarce although almost completely herbivorous they will occasionally eat invertebrates such as jellyfish sea squirts and shellfish dugongs in moreton bay australia are omnivorous feeding on invertebrates such as polychaetes or marine algae when the supply of their choice grasses decreases in other southern areas of both western and eastern australia there is evidence that dugongs actively seek out large invertebrates this does not apply to dugongs in tropical areas in which fecal evidence indicates that invertebrates are not eatenmost dugongs do not feed on lush areas but where the seagrass is more sparse additional factors such as protein concentration and regenerative ability also affect the value of a seagrass bed the chemical structure and composition of the seagrass is important and the grass species most often eaten are low in fiber high in nitrogen and easily digestible in the great barrier reef dugongs feed on seagrass such as halophila and halodule so as to maximize nutrient intake instead of bulk eating seagrasses of a lower seral are preferred where the area has not fully vegetated only certain seagrass meadows are suitable for dugong consumption due to the dugong highly specialized diet there is evidence that dugongs actively alter seagrass species compositions at local levels dugongs may search out deeper seagrass feeding trails have been observed as deep as metres ft and dugongs have been seen feeding as deep as metres ft dugongs are relatively swimming at around kilometres per hour mph when moving along the seabed to feed they walk on their pectoral finsdugong feeding may favor the subsequent growth seagrasses such as halophilia and halodule species such as zosteria capricorni are more dominant in established seagrass beds but grow slowly while halophilia and halodule grow quickly in the open space left by dugong feeding this behavior is known as cultivation grazing and favors the rapidly growing higher nutrient seagrasses that dugongs prefer dugongs may also prefer to feed on younger less fibrous strands of seagrasses and cycles of cultivation feeding at different seagrass meadows may provide them with a greater number of younger plants due to their poor eyesight dugongs often use smell to locate edible plants they also have a strong tactile sense and feel their surroundings with their long sensitive bristles they will dig up an entire plant and then shake it to remove the sand before eating it they have been known to collect a pile of plants in one area before eating them the flexible and muscular upper lip is used to dig out the plants this leaves furrows in the sand in their path reproduction and parental care a dugong reaches sexual maturity between the ages of eight and eighteen older than in most other mammals the way that females know how a male has reached sexual maturity is by the eruption of tusks in the male since tusks erupt in males when testosterone levels reach a high enough level the age when a female first gives birth is disputed with some studies placing the age between ten and seventeen years while others place it as early as six years there is evidence that male dugongs lose fertility at older ages despite the longevity of the dugong which may live for years or more females give birth only a few times during their life and invest considerable parental care in their young the time between births is unclear with estimates ranging from to yearsmating behaviour varies between populations located in different areas in some populations males will establish a territory which females in estrus will visit in these areas a male will try to impress the females while defending the area from other males a practice known as lekking in other areas many males will attempt to mate with the same female sometimes inflicting injuries to the female or each other during this the female will have copulated with multiple males who will have fought to mount her from below this greatly increases the chances of conceptionfemales give birth after a month gestation usually to just one calf birth occurs in very shallow water with occasions known where the mothers were almost on the shore as soon as the young is born the mother pushes it to the surface to take a breath newborns are already metres ft long and weigh around kilograms lb once born they stay close to their mothers possibly to make swimming easier the calf nurses for months although it begins to eat seagrasses soon after birth a calf will only leave its mother once it has matured when need to be nursed calves would suck their flippers in a sucking fashion as observed in calves under human care importance to humans dugongs have historically provided easy targets for hunters who killed them for their meat oil skin and bones as the anthropologist a asbjorn jon has noted they are often considered as the inspiration for mermaids and people around the world developed cultures around dugong hunting in some areas it remains an animal of great significance and a growing ecotourism industry around dugongs has had an economic benefit in some countriesthere is a wall painting of a dugong apparently drawn by neolithic peoples in tambun cave ipoh malaysia this was discovered by lieutenant rl rawlings in while on a routine patrol during the renaissance and the baroque eras dugongs were often exhibited in wunderkammers they were also presented as fiji mermaids in sideshows dugong meat and oil have traditionally been some of the most valuable foods of australian aborigines and torres strait islanders some aborigines regard dugongs as part of their aboriginality dugongs have also played a role in legends in kenya and the animal is known there as the queen of the sea body parts are used as food medicine and decorations in the gulf states dugongs served not only as a source of food but their tusks were used as sword handles dugong oil is important as a preservative and conditioner for wooden boats to people around the gulf of kutch in india who also believe the meat to be an aphrodisiac dugong ribs were used to make carvings in japan in southern china dugongs were traditionally regarded as a miraculous fish and it was bad luck to catch them a wave of immigration beginning at the end of the resulted in dugongs being hunted for food in the philippines dugongs are thought to bring bad luck and parts of them are used to ward against evil spirits in areas of thailand it is believed that the dugong tears form a powerful love potion while in parts of indonesia they are considered reincarnations of women in papua new guinea they are seen as a symbol of strength conservation dugong numbers have decreased in recent times for a population to remain stable percent of adults must survive the span of one year the estimated percentage of females humans can kill without depleting the population is this number is reduced in areas where calving is minimal due to food shortages even in the best conditions a population is unlikely to increase more than a year leaving dugongs vulnerable to the fact that they live in shallow waters puts them under great pressure from human activity research on dugongs and the effects of human activity on them has been limited mostly taking place in australia in many countries dugong numbers have never been surveyed as such trends are uncertain with more data needed for comprehensive management the only data stretching back far enough to mention population trends comes from the urban coast of queensland australia the last major worldwide study made in concluded that the dugong was declining and possibly extinct in a third of its range with unknown status in another halfthe iucn red list lists the dugong as vulnerable and the convention on international trade in endangered species of wild fauna and flora regulates and in some areas has banned international trade regional cooperation is important due to the widespread distribution of the animal and in there was strong support for southeast asian cooperation to protect dugongs kenya has passed legislation banning the hunting of dugongs and restricting trawling but the dugong is not yet listed under kenya wildlife act for endangered species mozambique has had legislation to protect dugongs since but this has not been effectively enforced many marine parks have been established on the african coast of the red sea and the egyptian gulf of aqaba is fully protected the united arab emirates has banned all hunting of dugongs within its waters as has bahrain the uae has additionally banned drift net fishing india and sri lanka ban the hunting and selling of dugongs and their products japan has listed dugongs as endangered and has banned intentional kills and harassment hunting catching and harassment are banned by the people republic of china the first marine mammal to be protected in the philippines was the dugong although monitoring this is difficult palau has legislated to protect dugongs although this is not well enforced and poaching persists indonesia lists dugongs as a protected species however protection is not always enforced and souvenir products made from dugong parts can be openly found in markets in bali the dugong is a national animal of papua new guinea which bans all except traditional hunting vanuatu and new caledonia ban hunting of dugongs dugongs are protected throughout australia although the rules vary by state in some areas indigenous hunting is allowed dugongs are listed under the nature conservation act in the australian state of queensland as vulnerable most currently live in established marine parks where boats must travel at a restricted speed and mesh net fishing is restricted in vietnam an illegal network targeting dugongs had been detected and was shut down in potential hunts along tanzanian coasts by fishermen have raised concerns as well human activity despite being legally protected in many countries the main causes of population decline remain anthropogenic and include hunting habitat degradation and fatalities entanglement in fishing nets has caused many deaths although there are no precise statistics most issues with industrial fishing occur in deeper waters where dugong populations are low with local fishing being the main risk in shallower waters as dugongs can not stay underwater for a very long period they are highly prone to deaths due to entanglement the use of shark nets has historically caused large numbers of deaths and they have been eliminated in most areas and replaced with baited hooks hunting has historically been a problem too although in most areas they are no longer hunted with the exception of certain indigenous communities in areas such as northern australia hunting remains the greatest impact on the dugong populationvessel strikes have proved a problem for manatees but the relevance of this to dugongs is unknown increasing boat traffic has increased danger especially in shallow waters ecotourism has increased in some countries although the effects remain undocumented it has been seen to cause issues in areas such as hainan due to environmental degradation modern farming practices and increased land clearing have also had an impact and much of the coastline of dugong habitats are undergoing industrialization with increasing human populations dugongs accumulate heavy metal ions in their tissues throughout their lives more so than other marine mammals the effects are unknown while international cooperation to form a conservative unit has been undertaken needs are an impediment to dugong conservation in many developing countries the shallow waters are often used as a source of food and income problems exacerbated by aid used to improve fishing in many countries the legislation does not exist to protect dugongs and if it does it is not enforcedoil spills are a danger to dugongs in some areas as is land reclamation in okinawa the small dugong population is threatened by united states military activity plans exist to build a military base close to the henoko reef and military activity also adds the threats of noise pollution chemical pollution soil erosion and exposure to depleted uranium the military base plans have been fought in us courts by some okinawans whose concerns include the impact on the local environment and dugong habitats it was later revealed that the government of japan was hiding evidence of the negative effects of ship lanes and human activities on dugongs observed during surveys carried out off henoko reef one of the three individuals has not been observed since june corresponding to the start of the excavation operations environmental degradation if dugongs do not get enough to eat they may calve later and produce fewer young food shortages can be caused by many factors such as a loss of habitat death and decline in quality of seagrass and a disturbance of feeding caused by human activity sewage detergents heavy metal hypersaline water herbicides and other waste products all negatively affect seagrass meadows human activity such as mining trawling dredging land reclamation and boat propeller scarring also cause an increase in sedimentation which smothers seagrass and prevents light from reaching it this is the most significant negative factor affecting seagrasshalophila of the dugong preferred species of rapidly due to lack of light dying completely after days extreme weather such as cyclones and floods can destroy hundreds of square kilometers of seagrass meadows as well as washing dugongs ashore the recovery of seagrass meadows and the spread of seagrass into new areas or areas where it has been destroyed can take over a decade most measures for protection involve restricting activities such as trawling in areas containing seagrass meadows with little to no action on pollutants originating from land in some areas water salinity is increased due to wastewater and it is unknown how much salinity seagrass can withstanddugong habitat in the oura bay area of henoko okinawa japan is currently under threat from land reclamation conducted by japanese government in order to build a us marine base in the area in august preliminary drilling surveys were conducted around the seagrass beds there the construction is expected to seriously damage the dugong population habitat possibly leading to local extinction capture and captivity the australian state of queensland has sixteen dugong protection parks and some preservation zones have been established where even aboriginal peoples are not allowed to hunt capturing animals for research has caused only one or two deaths dugongs are expensive to keep in captivity due to the long time mothers and calves spend together and the inability to grow the seagrass that dugongs eat in an aquarium only one orphaned calf has ever been successfully kept in captivityworldwide only three dugongs are held in captivity a female from the philippines lives at toba aquarium in toba mie japan a male also lived there until he died on february the second resides in sea world indonesia after having been rescued from a fisherman net and treated the last one a male is kept at sydney aquarium where he has resided since he was a juvenile sydney aquarium had a second dugong for many years until she died in a captive dugong at underwater world singapore was reported to have died in at the age of from complications arising from an acute digestive disorder references
