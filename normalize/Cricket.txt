cricket is a game played between two teams of eleven players on a field at the centre of which is a pitch with a wicket at each end each comprising two bails balanced on three stumps the batting side scores runs by striking the ball bowled at the wicket with the bat and running between the wickets while the bowling and fielding side tries to prevent this by getting the ball to either wicket and dismiss each batter so they are out means of dismissal include being bowled when the ball hits the stumps and dislodges the bails and by the fielding side catching the ball after it is hit by the bat but before it hits the ground when ten batters have been dismissed the innings ends and the teams swap roles the game is adjudicated by two umpires aided by a third umpire and match referee in international matches they communicate with two scorers who record the match statistical information forms of cricket range from with each team batting for a single innings of overs to test matches played over five days traditionally cricketers play in kit but in limited overs cricket they wear club or team colours in addition to the basic kit some players wear protective gear to prevent injury caused by the ball which is a hard solid spheroid made of compressed leather with a slightly raised sewn seam enclosing a cork core layered with tightly wound string the earliest reference to cricket is in south east england in the century it spread globally with the expansion of the british empire with the first international matches in the second half of the century the game governing body is the international cricket council icc which has over members twelve of which are full members who play test matches the game rules the laws of cricket are maintained by marylebone cricket club mcc in london the sport is followed primarily in the indian subcontinent australasia the united kingdom southern africa and the west indies women cricket which is organised and played separately has also achieved international standard the most successful side playing international cricket is australia which has won seven one day international trophies including five world cups more than any other country and has been the test side more than any other country history origins cricket is one of many games in the club ball sphere that basically involve hitting a ball with a implement others include baseball golf hockey tennis squash badminton and table tennis in cricket case a key difference is the existence of a solid target structure the wicket originally it is thought a wicket gate through which sheep were herded that the batsman must defend the cricket historian harry altham identified three groups of club ball games the hockey group in which the ball is driven to and fro between two targets the goals the golf group in which the ball is driven towards an undefended target the hole and the cricket group in which the ball is aimed at a mark the wicket and driven away from it it is generally believed that cricket originated as a children game in the counties of england sometime during the medieval period although there are claims for prior dates the earliest definite reference to cricket being played comes from evidence given at a court case in guildford on monday january julian calendar equating to january in the gregorian calendar the case concerned ownership of a certain plot of land and the court heard the testimony of a coroner john derrick who gave witness that being a scholler in the ffree schoole of guldeford hee and diverse of his fellows did runne and play there at creckett and other plaies given derrick age it was about half a century earlier when he was at school and so it is certain that cricket was being played c by boys in surrey the view that it was originally a children game is reinforced by randle cotgrave dictionary in which he defined the noun crosse as the crooked staff wherewith boys play at cricket and the verb form crosser as to play at cricket one possible source for the sport name is the old english word cryce or cricc meaning a crutch or staff in samuel johnson dictionary he derived cricket from cryce saxon a stick in old french the word criquet seems to have meant a kind of club or stick given the strong medieval trade connections between england and the county of flanders when the latter belonged to the duchy of burgundy the name may have been derived from the middle dutch in use in flanders at the time krick meaning a stick crook another possible source is the middle dutch word krickstoel meaning a long low stool used for kneeling in church and which resembled the long low wicket with two stumps used in early cricket according to heiner gillmeister a european language expert of bonn university cricket derives from the middle dutch phrase for hockey met de krik ket sen ie with the stick chase gillmeister has suggested that not only the name but also the sport itself may be of flemish origin growth of amateur and professional cricket in england although the main object of the game has always been to score the most runs the early form of cricket differed from the modern game in certain key technical aspects the ball was bowled underarm by the bowler and along the ground towards a batsman armed with a bat that in shape resembled a hockey stick the batsman defended a low wicket and runs were called notches because the scorers recorded them by notching tally sticksin the year cotgrave dictionary was published ecclesiastical court records at sidlesham in sussex state that two parishioners bartholomew wyatt and richard latter failed to attend church on easter sunday because they were playing cricket they were fined each and ordered to do penance this is the earliest mention of adult participation in cricket and it was around the same time that the earliest known organised or village match was played at chevening kent in a player called jasper vinall died after he was accidentally struck on the head during a match between two parish teams in sussexcricket remained a local pursuit for much of the century it is known through numerous references found in the records of ecclesiastical court cases to have been proscribed at times by the puritans before and during the commonwealth the problem was nearly always the issue of sunday play as the puritans considered cricket to be profane if played on the sabbath especially if large crowds or gambling were involvedaccording to the social historian derek birley there was a great upsurge of sport after the restoration in gambling on sport became a problem significant enough for parliament to pass the gambling act limiting stakes to which was in any case a colossal sum exceeding the annual income of of the population along with prizefighting horse racing and blood sports cricket was perceived to be a gambling sport rich patrons made matches for high stakes forming teams in which they engaged the first professional players by the end of the century cricket had developed into a major sport that was spreading throughout england and was already being taken abroad by english mariners and colonisers the earliest reference to cricket overseas is dated a newspaper report survives of a great cricket match played in sussex for fifty guineas apiece this is the earliest known contest that is generally considered a first class matchthe patrons and other players from the social class known as the gentry began to classify themselves as amateurs to establish a clear distinction from the professionals who were invariably members of the working class even to the point of having separate changing and dining facilities the gentry including such nobles as the dukes of richmond exerted their honour code of noblesse oblige to claim rights of leadership in any sporting contests they took part in especially as it was necessary for them to play alongside their social inferiors if they were to win their bets in time a perception took hold that the typical amateur who played in cricket until when amateurism was abolished was someone with a public school education who had then gone to one of cambridge or oxford university society insisted that such people were officers and gentlemen whose destiny was to provide leadership in a purely financial sense the cricketing amateur would theoretically claim expenses for playing while his professional counterpart played under contract and was paid a wage or match fee in practice many amateurs claimed more than actual expenditure and the derisive term shamateur was coined to describe the practice english cricket in the and centuries the game underwent major development in the century to become england national sport its success was underwritten by the twin necessities of patronage and betting cricket was prominent in london as early as and in the middle years of the century large crowds flocked to matches on the artillery ground in finsbury the single wicket form of the sport attracted huge crowds and wagers to match its popularity peaking in the season bowling underwent an evolution around when bowlers began to pitch the ball instead of rolling or skimming it towards the batsman this caused a revolution in bat design because to deal with the bouncing ball it was necessary to introduce the modern straight bat in place of the old hockey stick shapethe hambledon club was founded in the and for the next twenty years until the formation of marylebone cricket club mcc and the opening of lord old ground in hambledon was both the game greatest club and its focal point mcc quickly became the sport premier club and the custodian of the laws of cricket new laws introduced in the latter part of the century included the three stump wicket and leg before wicket lbw the century saw underarm bowling superseded by first roundarm and then overarm bowling both developments were controversial organisation of the game at county level led to the creation of the county clubs starting with sussex in in december the eight leading county clubs formed the official county championship which began in most famous player of the century was w g grace who started his long and influential career in it was especially during the career of grace that the distinction between amateurs and professionals became blurred by the existence of players like him who were nominally amateur but in terms of their financial gain de facto professional grace himself was said to have been paid more money for playing cricket than any professionalthe last two decades before the first world war have been called the golden age of cricket it is a nostalgic name prompted by the collective sense of loss resulting from the war but the period did produce some great players and memorable matches especially as organised competition at county and test level developed cricket becomes an international sport meanwhile the british empire had been instrumental in spreading the game overseas and by the middle of the century it had become well established in australia the caribbean india new zealand north america and south africa in the international match took place between the united states and canada in a team of english players went to north america on the first overseas tourin an english team made the first tour of australia the first australian team to travel overseas consisted of aboriginal stockmen who toured england in an england team took part in what was retrospectively recognised as the test match at the melbourne cricket ground against australia the rivalry between england and australia gave birth to the ashes in and this has remained test cricket most famous contest test cricket began to expand in when south africa played england world cricket in the century the years were dominated by australia don bradman statistically the greatest test batsman of all time test cricket continued to expand during the century with the addition of the west indies new zealand and india before the second world war and then pakistan sri lanka zimbabwe bangladesh ireland and afghanistan both in the period south africa was banned from international cricket from to as part of the apartheid boycott the rise of limited overs cricket cricket entered a new era in when english counties introduced the limited overs variant as it was sure to produce a result limited overs cricket was lucrative and the number of matches increased the first limited overs international was played in and the governing international cricket council icc seeing its potential staged the first limited overs cricket world cup in in the century a new limited overs form made an immediate impact on june afghanistan and ireland became the and icc full members enabling them to play test cricket laws and gameplay in cricket the rules of the game are specified in a code called the laws of cricket hereinafter called the laws which has a global remit there are laws always written with a capital l the earliest known version of the code was drafted in and since it has been owned and maintained by its custodian the marylebone cricket club mcc in london playing area cricket is a game played on a cricket field see image right between two teams of eleven players each the field is usually circular or oval in shape and the edge of the playing area is marked by a boundary which may be a fence part of the stands a rope a painted line or a combination of these the boundary must if possible be marked along its entire lengthin the approximate centre of the field is a rectangular pitch see image below on which a wooden target called a wicket is sited at each end the wickets are placed yards m apart the pitch is a flat surface feet m wide with very short grass that tends to be worn away as the game progresses cricket can also be played on artificial surfaces notably matting each wicket is made of three wooden stumps topped by two bails as illustrated above the pitch is marked at each end with four white painted lines a bowling crease a popping crease and two return creases the three stumps are aligned centrally on the bowling crease which is eight feet eight inches long the popping crease is drawn four feet in front of the bowling crease and parallel to it although it is drawn as a line six feet either side of the wicket it is in fact unlimited in length the return creases are drawn at right angles to the popping crease so that they intersect the ends of the bowling crease each return crease is drawn as an line so that it extends four feet behind the bowling crease but is also in fact unlimited in length match structure and closure before a match begins the team captains who are also players toss a coin to decide which team will bat first and so take the first innings innings is the term used for each phase of play in the match in each innings one team bats attempting to score runs while the other team bowls and fields the ball attempting to restrict the scoring and dismiss the batsmen when the first innings ends the teams change roles there can be two to four innings depending upon the type of match a match with four scheduled innings is played over three to five days a match with two scheduled innings is usually completed in a single day during an innings all eleven members of the fielding team take the field but usually only two members of the batting team are on the field at any given time the exception to this is if a batsman has any type of illness or injury restricting his or her ability to run in this case the batsman is allowed a runner who can run between the wickets when the batsman hits a scoring run or runs though this does not apply in international cricket the order of batsmen is usually announced just before the match but it can be variedthe main objective of each team is to score more runs than their opponents but in some forms of cricket it is also necessary to dismiss all of the opposition batsmen in their final innings in order to win the match which would otherwise be drawn if the team batting last is all out having scored fewer runs than their opponents they are said to have lost by n runs where n is the difference between the aggregate number of runs scored by the teams if the team that bats last scores enough runs to win it is said to have won by n wickets where n is the number of wickets left to fall for example a team that passes its opponents total having lost six wickets ie six of their batsmen have been dismissed have won the match by four wickets in a match one team combined first and second innings total may be less than the other side first innings total the team with the greater score is then said to have won by an innings and n runs and does not need to bat again n is the difference between the two teams aggregate scores if the team batting last is all out and both sides have scored the same number of runs then the match is a tie this result is quite rare in matches of two innings a side with only happening in matches from the earliest known instance in until january in the traditional form of the game if the time allotted for the match expires before either side can win then the game is declared a drawif the match has only a single innings per side then a maximum number of overs applies to each innings such a match is called a limited overs or match and the side scoring more runs wins regardless of the number of wickets lost so that a draw can not occur if this kind of match is temporarily interrupted by bad weather then a complex mathematical formula known as the method after its developers is often used to recalculate a new target score a match can also be declared a if fewer than a previously agreed number of overs have been bowled by either team in circumstances that make normal resumption of play impossible for example wet weatherin all forms of cricket the umpires can abandon the match if bad light or rain makes it impossible to continue there have been instances of entire matches even test matches scheduled to be played over five days being lost to bad weather without a ball being bowled for example the third test of the series in australia bat and ball the essence of the sport is that a bowler delivers ie bowls the ball from his or her end of the pitch towards the batsman who armed with a bat is on strike at the other end see next basic gameplay the bat is made of wood usually salix alba white willow and has the shape of a blade topped by a cylindrical handle the blade must not be more than inches cm wide and the total length of the bat not more than inches cm there is no standard for the weight which is usually between lb oz and lb and kg the ball is a hard spheroid with a circumference of inches cm the ball has a seam six rows of stitches attaching the leather shell of the ball to the string and cork interior the seam on a new ball is prominent and helps the bowler propel it in a less predictable manner during matches the quality of the ball deteriorates to a point where it is no longer usable during the course of this deterioration its behaviour in flight will change and can influence the outcome of the match players will therefore attempt to modify the ball behaviour by modifying its physical properties polishing the ball and wetting it with sweat or saliva is legal even when the polishing is deliberately done on one side only to increase the ball swing through the air but the acts of rubbing other substances into the ball scratching the surface or picking at the seam are illegal ball tampering basic gameplay bowler to batsman during normal play thirteen players and two umpires are on the field two of the players are batsmen and the rest are all eleven members of the fielding team the other nine players in the batting team are off the field in the pavilion the image with overlay below shows what is happening when a ball is being bowled and which of the personnel are on or close to the pitch in the photo the two batsmen wearing yellow have taken position at each end of the pitch three members of the fielding team wearing dark blue are in shot one of the two umpires wearing white hat is stationed behind the wicket at the bowler end of the pitch the bowler is bowling the ball from his end of the pitch to the batsman at the other end who is called the striker the other batsman at the bowling end is called the the who is a specialist is positioned behind the striker wicket and behind him stands one of the fielders in a position called first slip while the bowler and the first slip are wearing conventional kit only the two batsmen and the are wearing protective gear including safety helmets padded gloves and leg guards pads while the umpire in shot stands at the bowler end of the pitch his colleague stands in the outfield usually in or near the fielding position called square leg so that he is in line with the popping crease at the striker end of the pitch the bowling crease not numbered is the one on which the wicket is located between the return creases the bowler intends to hit the wicket with the ball or at least to prevent the striker from scoring runs the striker intends by using his bat to defend his wicket and if possible to hit the ball away from the pitch in order to score runs some players are skilled in both batting and bowling or as either or these as well as so are termed bowlers are classified according to their style generally as fast bowlers seam bowlers or spinners batsmen are classified according to whether they are or fielding of the eleven fielders three are in shot in the image above the other eight are elsewhere on the field their positions determined on a tactical basis by the captain or the bowler fielders often change position between deliveries again as directed by the captain or bowlerif a fielder is injured or becomes ill during a match a substitute is allowed to field instead of him but the substitute can not bowl or act as a captain except in the case of concussion substitutes in international cricket the substitute leaves the field when the injured player is fit to return the laws of cricket were updated in to allow substitutes to act as specialist roles the captain is often the most experienced player in the team certainly the most tactically astute and can possess any of the main skillsets as a batsman a bowler or a within the laws the captain has certain responsibilities in terms of nominating his players to the umpires before the match and ensuring that his players conduct themselves within the spirit and traditions of the game as well as within the laws the sometimes called simply the keeper is a specialist fielder subject to various rules within the laws about his equipment and demeanour he is the only member of the fielding side who can effect a stumping and is the only one permitted to wear gloves and external leg guards depending on their primary skills the other ten players in the team tend to be classified as specialist batsmen or specialist bowlers generally a team will include five or six specialist batsmen and four or five specialist bowlers plus the clothing and equipment the and the batsmen wear protective gear because of the hardness of the ball which can be delivered at speeds of more than kilometres per hour mph and presents a major health and safety concern protective clothing includes pads designed to protect the knees and shins batting gloves or gloves for the hands a safety helmet for the head and a box for male players inside the trousers to protect the crotch area some batsmen wear additional padding inside their shirts and trousers such as thigh pads arm pads rib protectors and shoulder pads the only fielders allowed to wear protective gear are those in positions very close to the batsman ie if they are alongside or in front of him but they can not wear gloves or external leg guardssubject to certain variations clothing generally includes a collared shirt with short or long sleeves long trousers woolen pullover if needed cricket cap for fielding or a safety helmet and spiked shoes or boots to increase traction the kit is traditionally all white and this remains the case in test and cricket but in limited overs cricket team colours are worn instead innings the innings ending with in both singular and plural form is the term used for each phase of play during a match depending on the type of match being played each team has either one or two innings sometimes all eleven members of the batting side take a turn to bat but for various reasons an innings can end before they have all done so the innings terminates if the batting team is all out a term defined by the laws at the fall of a wicket or the retirement of a batsman further balls remain to be bowled but no further batsman is available to come in in this situation one of the batsmen has not been dismissed and is termed not out this is because he has no partners left and there must always be two active batsmen while the innings is in progress an innings may end early while there are still two not out batsmen the batting team captain may declare the innings closed even though some of his players have not had a turn to bat this is a tactical decision by the captain usually because he believes his team have scored sufficient runs and need time to dismiss the opposition in their innings the set number of overs ie in a limited overs match have been bowled the match has ended prematurely due to bad weather or running out of time in the final innings of the match the batting side has reached its target and won the game overs the laws state that throughout an innings the ball shall be bowled from each end alternately in overs of balls the name over came about because the umpire calls over when six balls have been bowled at this point another bowler is deployed at the other end and the fielding side changes ends while the batsmen do not a bowler can not bowl two successive overs although a bowler can and usually does bowl alternate overs from the same end for several overs which are termed a spell the batsmen do not change ends at the end of the over and so the one who was is now the striker and the umpires also change positions so that the one who was at square leg now stands behind the wicket at the end and umpires and scorers the game on the field is regulated by the two umpires one of whom stands behind the wicket at the bowler end the other in a position called square leg which is about metres away from the batsman on strike and in line with the popping crease on which he is taking guard the umpires have several responsibilities including adjudication on whether a ball has been correctly bowled ie not a or a wide when a run is scored whether a batsman is out the fielding side must first appeal to the umpire usually with the phrase how that or owzat when intervals start and end and the suitability of the pitch field and weather for playing the game the umpires are authorised to interrupt or even abandon a match due to circumstances likely to endanger the players such as a damp pitch or deterioration of the lightoff the field in televised matches there is usually a third umpire who can make decisions on certain incidents with the aid of video evidence the third umpire is mandatory under the playing conditions for test and limited overs international matches played between two icc full member countries these matches also have a match referee whose job is to ensure that play is within the laws and the spirit of the gamethe match details including runs and dismissals are recorded by two official scorers one representing each team the scorers are directed by the hand signals of an umpire see image right for example the umpire raises a forefinger to signal that the batsman is out has been dismissed he raises both arms above his head if the batsman has hit the ball for six runs the scorers are required by the laws to record all runs scored wickets taken and overs bowled in practice they also note significant amounts of additional data relating to the gamea match statistics are summarised on a scorecard prior to the popularisation of scorecards most scoring was done by men sitting on vantage points cuttings notches on tally sticks and runs were originally called notches according to rowland bowen the earliest known scorecard templates were introduced in by t pratt of sevenoaks and soon came into general use it is believed that scorecards were printed and sold at lord for the first time in spirit of the game besides observing the laws cricketers must respect the spirit of cricket which is the preamble to the laws first published in the code and updated in and now opens with this statement cricket owes much of its appeal and enjoyment to the fact that it should be played not only according to the laws but also within the spirit of cricket the preamble is a short statement that emphasises the positive behaviours that make cricket an exciting game that encourages leadership friendship and teamwork the major responsibility for ensuring fair play is placed firmly on the captains but extends to all players umpires teachers coaches and parents involved the umpires are the sole judges of fair and unfair play they are required under the laws to intervene in case of dangerous or unfair play or in cases of unacceptable conduct by a player previous versions of the spirit identified actions that were deemed contrary for example appealing knowing that the batsman is not out but all specifics are now covered in the laws of cricket the relevant governing playing regulations and disciplinary codes or left to the judgement of the umpires captains their clubs and governing bodies the terse expression of the spirit of cricket now avoids the diversity of cultural conventions that exist in the detail of sportsmanship or its absence bowling and dismissal most bowlers are considered specialists in that they are selected for the team because of their skill as a bowler although some are and even specialist batsmen bowl occasionally the specialists bowl several times during an innings but may not bowl two overs consecutively if the captain wants a bowler to change ends another bowler must temporarily fill in so that the change is not immediatea bowler reaches his delivery stride by means of a and an over is deemed to have begun when the bowler starts his for the first delivery of that over the ball then being in play fast bowlers needing momentum take a lengthy run up while bowlers with a slow delivery take no more than a couple of steps before bowling the fastest bowlers can deliver the ball at a speed of over kilometres per hour mph and they sometimes rely on sheer speed to try to defeat the batsman who is forced to react very quickly other fast bowlers rely on a mixture of speed and guile by making the ball seam or swing ie curve in flight this type of delivery can deceive a batsman into miscuing his shot for example so that the ball just touches the edge of the bat and can then be caught behind by the or a slip fielder at the other end of the bowling scale is the spin bowler who bowls at a relatively slow pace and relies entirely on guile to deceive the batsman a spinner will often buy his wicket by tossing one up in a slower steeper parabolic path to lure the batsman into making a poor shot the batsman has to be very wary of such deliveries as they are often flighted or spun so that the ball will not behave quite as he expects and he could be trapped into getting himself out in between the pacemen and the spinners are the medium paced seamers who rely on persistent accuracy to try to contain the rate of scoring and wear down the batsman concentrationthere are ten ways in which a batsman can be dismissed five relatively common and five extremely rare the common forms of dismissal are bowled caught leg before wicket lbw run out and stumped rare methods are hit wicket hit the ball twice obstructing the field handled the ball and timed out the laws state that the fielding team usually the bowler in practice must appeal for a dismissal before the umpire can give his decision if the batsman is out the umpire raises a forefinger and says out otherwise he will shake his head and say not out there is effectively an eleventh method of dismissal retired out which is not an dismissal as such but rather a retrospective one for which no fielder is credited batting runs and extras batsmen take turns to bat via a batting order which is decided beforehand by the team captain and presented to the umpires though the order remains flexible when the captain officially nominates the team substitute batsmen are generally not allowed except in the case of concussion substitutes in international cricketin order to begin batting the batsman first adopts a batting stance standardly this involves adopting a slight crouch with the feet pointing across the front of the wicket looking in the direction of the bowler and holding the bat so it passes over the feet and so its tip can rest on the ground near to the toes of the back foota skilled batsman can use a wide array of shots or strokes in both defensive and attacking mode the idea is to hit the ball to the best effect with the flat surface of the bat blade if the ball touches the side of the bat it is called an edge the batsman does not have to play a shot and can allow the ball to go through to the wicketkeeper equally he does not have to attempt a run when he hits the ball with his bat batsmen do not always seek to hit the ball as hard as possible and a good player can score runs just by making a deft stroke with a turn of the wrists or by simply blocking the ball but directing it away from fielders so that he has time to take a run a wide variety of shots are played the batsman repertoire including strokes named according to the style of swing and the direction aimed eg cut drive hook pull the batsman on strike ie the striker must prevent the ball hitting the wicket and try to score runs by hitting the ball with his bat so that he and his partner have time to run from one end of the pitch to the other before the fielding side can return the ball to register a run both runners must touch the ground behind the popping crease with either their bats or their bodies the batsmen carry their bats as they run each completed run increments the score of both the team and the striker the decision to attempt a run is ideally made by the batsman who has the better view of the ball progress and this is communicated by calling usually yes no or wait more than one run can be scored from a single hit hits worth one to three runs are common but the size of the field is such that it is usually difficult to run four or more to compensate for this hits that reach the boundary of the field are automatically awarded four runs if the ball touches the ground en route to the boundary or six runs if the ball clears the boundary without touching the ground within the boundary in these cases the batsmen do not need to run hits for five are unusual and generally rely on the help of overthrows by a fielder returning the ball if an odd number of runs is scored by the striker the two batsmen have changed ends and the one who was is now the striker only the striker can score individual runs but all runs are added to the team totaladditional runs can be gained by the batting team as extras called sundries in australia due to errors made by the fielding side this is achieved in four ways a penalty of one extra conceded by the bowler if he breaks the rules wide a penalty of one extra conceded by the bowler if he bowls so that the ball is out of the batsman reach bye an extra awarded if the batsman misses the ball and it goes past the and gives the batsmen time to run in the conventional way leg bye as for a bye except that the ball has hit the batsman body though not his bat if the bowler has conceded a or a wide his team incurs an additional penalty because that ball ie delivery has to be bowled again and hence the batting side has the opportunity to score more runs from this extra ball women cricket women cricket was first recorded in surrey in international development began at the start of the century and the first test match was played between australia and england in december the following year new zealand women joined them and in netherlands women became the tenth women test nation when they made their debut against south africa women in the international women cricket council was founded it merged with the icc in in the first cricket world cup of any kind took place when a women world cup was held in england in the international women cricket council was merged with the international cricket council icc to form one unified body to help manage and develop cricket the icc women rankings were launched on october covering all three formats of women cricket in october following the icc decision to award international status to all members the women rankings were split into separate odi for full members and lists governance the international cricket council icc which has its headquarters in dubai is the global governing body of cricket it was founded as the imperial cricket conference in by representatives from england australia and south africa renamed the international cricket conference in and took up its current name in the icc in has member nations twelve of which hold full membership and can play test cricket the icc is responsible for the organisation and governance of cricket major international tournaments notably the men and women versions of the cricket world cup it also appoints the umpires and referees that officiate at all sanctioned test matches limited overs internationals and internationals each member nation has a national cricket board which regulates cricket matches played in its country selects the national squad and organises home and away tours for the national team in the west indies which for cricket purposes is a federation of nations these matters are addressed by cricket west indiesthe table below lists the icc full members and their national cricket boards types of match cricket is a sport with multiple formats that can effectively be divided into cricket limited overs cricket and historically single wicket cricket the highest standard is test cricket always written with a capital t which is in effect the international version of cricket and is restricted to teams representing the twelve countries that are full members of the icc see above although the term test match was not coined until much later test cricket is deemed to have begun with two matches between australia and england in the australian season since most test series between england and australia have been played for a trophy known as the ashes the term in general usage is applied to domestic cricket test matches are played over five days and over three to four days in all of these matches the teams are allotted two innings each and the draw is a valid resultlimited overs cricket is always scheduled for completion in a single day and the teams are allotted one innings each there are two types list a which normally allows fifty overs per team and in which the teams have twenty overs each both of the limited overs forms are played internationally as limited overs internationals loi and internationals list a was introduced in england in the season as a knockout cup contested by the county clubs in a national league competition was established the concept was gradually introduced to the other leading cricket countries and the first limited overs international was played in in the first cricket world cup took place in england is a new variant of limited overs itself with the purpose being to complete the match within about three hours usually in an evening session the first world championship was held in limited overs matches can not be drawn although a tie is possible and an unfinished match is a no result single wicket was popular in the and centuries and its matches were generally considered in this form although each team may have from one to six players there is only one batsman in at a time and he must face every delivery bowled while his innings lasts single wicket has rarely been played since limited overs cricket began matches tended to have two innings per team like a full one and they could end in a draw international competitions most international matches are played as parts of when one nation travels to another for a number of weeks or months and plays a number of matches of various sorts against the host nation sometimes a perpetual trophy is awarded to the winner of the test series the most famous of which is the ashes the icc also organises competitions that are for several countries at once including the cricket world cup icc world cup and icc champions trophy a league competition for test matches played as part of normal tours the icc world test championship had been proposed several times and its first instance began in a league competition for odis the icc cricket world cup super league is planned to begin in the icc maintains test rankings odi rankings and rankings systems for the countries which play these forms of cricket competitions for member nations of the icc with associate status include the icc intercontinental cup for cricket matches and the world cricket league for matches the final matches of which now also serve as the icc world cup qualifier national competitions cricket in england is played for the most part by the county clubs which contest the county championship the concept of a champion county has existed since the century but the official competition was not established until the most successful club has been yorkshire who had won official titles plus one shared as of established its national
