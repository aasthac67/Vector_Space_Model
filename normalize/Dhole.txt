the dhole cuon alpinus is a canid native to central south east asia and southeast asia other english names for the species include asian wild dog asiatic wild dog indian wild dog whistling dog red dog and mountain wolf it is genetically close to species within the genus canis but distinct in several anatomical aspects its skull is convex rather than concave in profile it lacks a third lower molar and the upper molars sport only a single cusp as opposed to between two and four during the pleistocene the dhole ranged throughout asia europe and north america but became restricted to its historical range years agothe dhole is a highly social animal living in large clans without rigid dominance hierarchies and containing multiple breeding females such clans usually consist of individuals but groups of over are known it is a diurnal pack hunter which preferentially targets and ungulates in tropical forests the dhole competes with tiger and leopard targeting somewhat different prey species but still with substantial dietary overlapit is listed as endangered by the iucn as populations are decreasing and are estimated at fewer than adults factors contributing to this decline include habitat loss loss of prey competition with other species persecution due to livestock predation and disease transfer from domestic dogs etymology and naming the etymology of dhole is unclear the possible earliest written use of the word in english occurred in by soldier thomas williamson who encountered the animal in ramghur district he stated that dhole was a common local name for the species in charles hamilton smith claimed that it was derived from a language spoken in parts of the years later smith connected this word with turkish deli crazy and erroneously compared the turkish word with old saxon dol and dutch dol cfr also english dull german toll which are in fact from the dwalaz stupid richard lydekker wrote nearly years later that the word was not used by the natives living within the species range the dictionary theorises that it may have come from the kannada tola taxonomy and evolution canis alpinus was the binomial name proposed by peter simon pallas in who described its range as encompassing the upper levels of udskoi ostrog in amurland towards the eastern side and in the region of the upper lena river around the yenisei river and occasionally crossing into china this northern russian range reported by pallas during the and centuries is considerably north of where this species occurs todaycanis primaevus was a name proposed by brian houghton hodgson in who thought that the dhole is a primitive canis form and the progenitor of the domestic dog hodgson later took note of the dhole physical distinctiveness from the genus canis and proposed the genus cuonthe first study on the origins of the species was conducted by paleontologist erich thenius who concluded that the dhole was a descendant of a golden ancestor the earliest known member of the genus cuon is the chinese cuon majori of the villafranchian period it resembled canis in its physical form more than the modern species which has greatly reduced molars whose cusps have developed into sharply trenchant points by the middle pleistocene c majori had lost the last lower molar altogether c alpinus itself arose during the late middle pleistocene by which point the transformation of the lower molar into a single cusped slicing tooth had been completed late middle pleistocene dholes were virtually indistinguishable from their modern descendants save for their greater size which closely approached that of the gray wolf the dhole became extinct in much of europe during the late wurm period though it may have survived up until the early holocene in the iberian peninsula and at riparo fredian in northern italy the vast pleistocene range of this species also included numerous islands in asia that this species no longer inhabits such as sri lanka borneo and possibly palawan in the philippines the fossil record indicates that the species also occurred in north america with remains being found in beringia and mexicothe dhole distinctive morphology has been a source of much confusion in determining the species systematic position among the canidae george simpson placed the dhole in the subfamily simocyoninae alongside the african wild dog and the bush dog on account of all three species similar dentition subsequent authors including juliet noted greater morphological similarities to canids of the genera canis dusicyon and alopex than to either speothos or lycaon with any resemblance to the latter two being due to convergent evolutionsome authors consider the extinct canis subgenus named xenocyon as ancestral to both the genus lycaon and the genus cuon subsequent studies on the canid genome revealed that the dhole and african wild dog are closely related to members of the genus canis this closeness to canis may have been confirmed in a menagerie in madras where according to zoologist reginald pocock there is a record of a dhole interbred with a golden jackal admixture with the african wild dog in whole genome sequencing was used to compare all members apart from the and jackals of the genus canis along with the dhole and the african wild dog lycaon pictus there was strong evidence of ancient genetic admixture between the dhole and the african wild dog today their ranges are remote from each other however during the pleistocene era the dhole could be found as far west as europe the study proposes that the dhole distribution may have once included the middle east from where it may have admixed with the african wild dog in north africa however there is no evidence of the dhole having existed in the middle east nor north africa subspecies historically up to subspecies of dholes have been recognised as of seven subspecies are recognised by however studies on the dhole mtdna and microsatellite genotype showed no clear subspecific distinctions nevertheless two major phylogeographic groupings were discovered in dholes of the asian mainland which likely diverged during a glaciation event one population extends from south central and north india south of the ganges into myanmar and the other extends from india north of the ganges into northeastern india myanmar thailand and the malaysian peninsula the origin of dholes in sumatra and java is as of unclear as they show greater relatedness to dholes in india myanmar and china rather than with those in nearby malaysia in the absence of further data the researchers involved in the study speculated that javan and sumatran dholes could have been introduced to the islands by humans characteristics in appearance the dhole has been variously described as combining the physical characteristics of the gray wolf and the red fox and as being on account of its long backbone and slender limbs it has a wide and massive skull with a sagittal crest and its masseter muscles are highly developed compared to other canid species giving the face an almost appearance the rostrum is shorter than that of domestic dogs and most other canids the species has six rather than seven lower molars the upper molars are weak being one third to one half the size of those of wolves and have only one cusp as opposed to between two and four as is usual in canids an adaptation thought to improve shearing ability thus allowing it to compete more successfully with kleptoparasites adult females can weigh from to kg to lb while the slightly larger male may weigh from to kg to lb the mean weight of adults from three small samples was kg lb occasionally dholes may be sympatric with the indian wolf canis lupus pallipes which is one of the smallest races of the gray wolf but is still approximately heavier on average it stands to in to mm at the shoulder and measures ft m in body length its ears are somewhat rounded but less so than the african wild dog the general tone of the fur is reddish with the brightest hues occurring in winter in the winter coat the back is clothed in a saturated to reddish colour with brownish highlights along the top of the head neck and shoulders the throat chest flanks and belly and the upper parts of the limbs are less brightly coloured and are more yellowish in tone the lower parts of the limbs are whitish with dark brownish bands on the anterior sides of the forelimbs the muzzle and forehead are the tail is very luxuriant and fluffy and is mainly of a colour with a dark brown tip the summer coat is shorter coarser and darker the dorsal and lateral guard hairs in adults measure mm in length dholes in the moscow zoo moult once a year from march to maydholes produce whistles resembling the calls of red foxes sometimes rendered as how this sound is produced is unknown though it is thought to help in coordinating the pack when travelling through thick brush when attacking prey they emit screaming kakakakaa sounds other sounds include whines food soliciting growls warning screams chatterings both of which are alarm calls and yapping cries in contrast to wolves dholes do not howl or bark dholes have a complex body language friendly or submissive greetings are accompanied by horizontal lip retraction and the lowering of the tail as well as licking playful dholes open their mouths with their lips retracted and their tails held in a vertical position whilst assuming a play bow aggressive or threatening dholes pucker their lips forward in a snarl and raise the hairs on their backs as well as keep their tails horizontal or vertical when afraid they pull their lips back horizontally with their tails tucked and their ears flat against the skull distribution and habitat the dhole still occurs in tibet and possibly also in north korea it once inhabited the alpine steppes extending into kashmir to the ladakh area but has not been recorded in pakistan in central asia the dhole primarily inhabits mountainous areas in the western part of its range it lives mostly in alpine meadows and steppes high above sea level while in the east it mainly ranges in montane taigas and is sometimes sighted along coastlines in india myanmar indochina indonesia and china it prefers forested areas in alpine zones and occasionally also in plains regionsthe dhole might still be present in the tunkinsky national park in extreme southern siberia near lake baikal it possibly still lives in the primorsky krai province in far eastern russia where it was considered a rare and endangered species in with unconfirmed reports in the dom protected forest area no sighting was reported in other areas since the late currently no other recent reports are confirmed of dhole being present in russiaone pack was sighted in the qilian mountains in in to local government officials and herders reported the presence of several dhole packs at elevations of to m to ft near taxkorgan nature reserve in the xinjiang autonomous region several packs and a female adult with pups were also recorded by camera traps at elevations of around to m to ft in yanchiwan national nature reserve in the northern gansu province in dholes have been also reported in the mountainsin china yunnan province dholes were recorded in baima xueshan nature reserve in dhole samples from wild animals were recently obtained in the jiangxi province in confirmed records by since have occurred in southern and western gansu province southern shaanxi province southern qinghai province southern and western yunnan province western sichuan province the southern xinjiang autonomous region and in the southeastern tibet autonomoous regionthe dhole occurs in most of india south of the ganges particularly in the central indian highlands and the western and eastern ghats it is also present in arunachal pradesh assam meghalaya and west bengal and in the plain terai region dhole populations in the himalayas and northwest india are fragmentedin dhole packs were recorded by camera traps in the chitwan national park its presence was confirmed in the kanchenjunga conservation area in by camera traps in february dholes were sighted in the vansda national park with camera traps confirming the presence of two individuals in may of the same year this was the first confirmed sighting of dholes in gujarat since bhutan the dhole is present in jigme dorji national parkin bangladesh it inhabits forest reserves in the sylhet area as well the chittagong hill tracts in the southeast recent camera trap photos in the chittagong in showed the continued presence of the dhole these regions probably do not harbour a viable population as mostly small groups or solitary individuals were sightedin myanmar the dhole is present in several protected areas in dholes and tigers were recorded by for the first time in the hill forests of karen stateits range is highly fragmented in the malaysian peninsula sumatra java vietnam and thailand in camera trap videos in the montane tropical forests at m ft in the kerinci seblat national park in sumatra revealed its continued presence a camera trapping survey in the khao ang rue nai wildlife sanctuary in thailand from january to february documented one healthy dhole pack in northern laos dholes were studied in nam louey national protected area camera trap surveys from recorded dholes in the same nam louey national protected areain vietnam dholes were sighted only in pu mat national park in in yok don national park in and and in ninh thuan province in disjunct dhole population was reported in the area of trabzon and rize in northeastern turkey near the border with georgia in the this report was not considered to be reliable one single individual was claimed to have been shot in in the nearby republic in the central caucasus its remains were analysed in may by a biologist from the state university who concluded that the skull was indeed of a dhole in august researchers from the national museum of natural history and the karadeniz technical university started an expedition to track and document this possible turkish population of dhole in october they concluded that no real evidence exists of a living dhole population in turkey or in the republic pending dna analysis of samples from the original skins ecology and behaviour social and territorial behaviour dholes are more social than gray wolves and have less of a dominance hierarchy as seasonal scarcity of food is not a serious concern for them in this manner they closely resemble african wild dogs in social structure they live in clans rather than packs as the latter term refers to a group of animals that always hunt together in contrast dhole clans frequently break into small packs of to animals particularly during the spring season as this is the optimal number for catching fawns dominant dholes are hard to identify as they do not engage in dominance displays as wolves do though other clan members will show submissive behaviour toward them intragroup fighting is rarely observeddholes are far less territorial than wolves with pups from one clan often joining another without trouble once they mature sexually clans typically number to individuals in india though clans of have been reported in thailand clans rarely exceed three individuals unlike other canids there is no evidence of dholes using urine to mark their territories or travel routes when urinating dholes especially males may raise one hind leg or both to result in a handstand handstand urination is also seen in bush dogs speothos venaticus they may defecate in conspicuous places though a territorial function is unlikely as faeces are mostly deposited within the clan territory rather than the periphery faeces are often deposited in what appear to be communal latrines they do not scrape the earth with their feet as other canids do to mark their territories denning four kinds of den have been described simple earth dens with one entrance usually remodeled striped hyena or porcupine dens complex cavernous earth dens with more than one entrance simple cavernous dens excavated under or between rocks and complex cavernous dens with several other dens in the vicinity some of which are interconnected dens are typically located under dense scrub or on the banks of dry rivers or creeks the entrance to a dhole den can be almost vertical with a sharp turn three to four feet down the tunnel opens into an antechamber from which extends more than one passage some dens may have up to six entrances leading up to feet m of interconnecting tunnels these cities may be developed over many generations of dholes and are shared by the clan females when raising young together like african wild dogs and dingoes dholes will avoid killing prey close to their dens reproduction and development in india the mating season occurs between and january while captive dholes in the moscow zoo breed mostly in february unlike wolf packs dhole clans may contain more than one breeding female more than one female dhole may den and rear their litters together in the same den during mating the female assumes a crouched position there is no copulatory tie characteristic of other canids when the male dismounts instead the pair lie on their sides facing each other in a semicircular formation the gestation period lasts days with litter sizes averaging four to six pups their growth rate is much faster than that of wolves being similar in rate to that of coyotes the hormone metabolites of five males and three females kept in thai zoos was studied the breeding males showed an increased level of testosterone from october to january the oestrogen level of captive females increases for about weeks in january followed by an increase of progesterone they displayed sexual behaviours during the oestrogen peak of the femalespups are suckled at least days during this time the pack feeds the mother at the den site dholes do not use rendezvous sites to meet their pups as wolves do though one or more adults will stay with the pups at the den while the rest of the pack hunts once weaning begins the adults of the clan will regurgitate food for the pups until they are old enough to join in hunting they remain at the den site for days by the age of six months pups accompany the adults on hunts and will assist in killing large prey such as sambar by the age of eight months maximum longevity in captivity is years hunting behaviour before embarking on a hunt clans go through elaborate prehunt social rituals involving nuzzling body rubbing and and heterosexual mounting dholes are primarily diurnal hunters hunting in the early hours of the morning they rarely hunt nocturnally except on moonlit nights indicating they greatly rely on sight when hunting although not as fast as jackals and foxes they can chase their prey for many hours during a pursuit one or more dholes may take over chasing their prey while the rest of the pack keeps up at a steadier pace behind taking over once the other group tires most chases are short lasting only m when chasing prey they run at a pace of mph dholes frequently drive their prey into water bodies where the targeted animal movements are hinderedonce large prey is caught one dhole will grab the prey nose while the rest of the pack pulls the animal down by the flanks and hindquarters they do not use a killing bite to the throat they occasionally blind their prey by attacking the eyes serows are among the only ungulate species capable of effectively defending themselves against dhole attacks due to their thick protective coats and short sharp horns capable of easily impaling dholes they will tear open their prey flanks and disembowel it eating the heart liver lungs and some sections of the intestines the stomach and rumen are usually left untouched prey weighing less than kg is usually killed within two minutes while large stags may take minutes to die once prey is secured dholes will tear off pieces of the carcass and eat in seclusion unlike wolf packs in which the breeding pair monopolises food dholes give priority to the pups when feeding at a kill allowing them to eat first they are generally tolerant of scavengers at their kills both mother and young are provided with regurgitated food by other pack members feeding ecology prey animals in india include chital sambar deer muntjac mouse deer barasingha wild boar gaur water buffaloes banteng cattle nilgai goats indian hares himalayan field rats and langurs there is one record of a pack bringing down an indian elephant calf in assam despite desperate defense of the mother resulting in numerous losses to the pack in kashmir they prey on markhor and thamin in myanmar malayan tapir sumatran serow in sumatra and the malay peninsula and javan rusa in java in the tian shan and tarbagatai mountains dholes prey on siberian ibexes arkhar roe deer maral and wild boar in the altai and sayan mountains they prey on musk deer and reindeer in eastern siberia they prey on roe deer manchurian wapiti wild pig musk deer and reindeer while in primorye they feed on sika deer and goral in mongolia they prey on argali and rarely siberian ibexlike african wild dogs but unlike wolves dholes are not known to attack people dholes eat fruit and vegetable matter more readily than other canids in captivity they eat various kinds of grasses herbs and leaves seemingly for pleasure rather than just when ill in summertime in the tian shan mountains dholes eat large quantities of mountain rhubarb although opportunistic dholes have a seeming aversion to hunting cattle and their calves livestock predation by dholes has been a problem in bhutan since the late as domestic animals are often left outside to graze in the forest sometimes for weeks at a time livestock at night and grazed near homes are never attacked oxen are killed more often than cows probably because they are given less protection enemies and competitors in some areas dholes are sympatric to tigers and leopards competition between these species is mostly avoided through differences in prey selection although there is still substantial dietary overlap along with leopards dholes typically target animals in the kg range mean weights of kg for dhole and kg for leopard while tigers selected for prey animals heavier than kg but their mean prey weight was kg also other characteristics of the prey such as sex arboreality and aggressiveness may play a role in prey selection for example dholes preferentially select male chital whereas leopards kill both sexes more evenly and tigers prefer larger prey altogether dholes and tigers kill langurs rarely compared to leopards due to the leopards greater arboreality while leopards kill wild boar infrequently due to the inability of this relatively light predator to tackle aggressive prey of comparable weighton some occasions dholes may attack tigers when confronted by dholes tigers will seek refuge in trees or stand with their backs to a tree or bush where they may be mobbed for lengthy periods before finally attempting escape escaping tigers are usually killed while tigers which stand their ground have a greater chance of survival tigers are dangerous opponents for dholes as they have sufficient strength to kill a dhole with a single paw strike dhole packs may steal leopard kills while leopards may kill dholes if they encounter them singly or in pairs since leopards are smaller than tigers and are more likely to hunt dholes dhole packs tend to react more aggressively toward them than they do towards tigersthere are numerous records of leopards being treed by dholes dholes sometimes drive tigers leopards snow leopards and bears see below from their kills dholes were once thought to be a major factor in reducing asiatic cheetah populations though this is doubtful as cheetahs live in open areas as opposed to forested areas favoured by dholesdhole packs occasionally attack asiatic black bears snow leopards and sloth bears when attacking bears dholes will attempt to prevent them from seeking refuge in caves and lacerate their hindquartersalthough usually antagonistic toward wolves they may hunt and feed alongside one another there is at least one record of a lone wolf associating with a pair of dholes in debrigarh wildlife sanctuary they infrequently associate in mixed groups with eurasian golden jackals domestic dogs may kill dholes though they will feed alongside them on occasion diseases and parasites dholes are vulnerable to a number of different diseases particularly in areas where they are sympatric with other canid species infectious pathogens such as toxocara canis are present in their faeces they may suffer from rabies canine distemper mange trypanosomiasis canine parvovirus and endoparasites such as cestodes and roundworms threats the dhole only rarely takes domestic livestock certain people such as the kurumbas and some mon tribes will appropriate dhole kills some indian villagers welcome the dhole because of this appropriation of dhole kills dholes were persecuted throughout india for bounties until they were given protection by the wildlife protection act of methods used for dhole hunting included poisoning snaring shooting and clubbing at den sites native indian people killed dholes primarily to protect livestock while british sporthunters during the british raj did so under the conviction that dholes were responsible for drops in game populations persecution of dholes still occurs with varying degrees of intensity according to the region bounties paid for dholes used to be rupees though this was reduced to in after the number of presented dhole carcasses became too numerous to maintain the established reward in indochina dholes suffer heavily from nonselective hunting techniques such as snaringthe fur trade does not pose a significant threat to dholes the people of india do not eat dhole flesh and their fur is not considered overly valuable due to their rarity dholes were never harvested for their skins in large numbers in the soviet union and were sometimes accepted as dog or wolf pelts being labeled as half wolf for the latter the winter fur was prized by the chinese who bought dhole pelts in ussuriysk during the late for a few silver rubles in the early century dhole pelts reached eight rubles in manchuria in semirechye fur coats made from dhole skin were considered the warmest but were very costly conservation in india the dhole is protected under schedule of the wildlife protection act the creation of reserves under project tiger provided some protection for dhole populations sympatric with tigers in the indian government sanctioned its first dhole conservation breeding centre at the indira gandhi zoological park igzp in visakhapatnam the dhole has been protected in russia since though it is vulnerable to poison left out for wolves in china the animal is listed as a category ii protected species under the chinese wildlife protection act of in cambodia the dhole is protected from all hunting while conservation laws in vietnam limit extraction and utilisationin the korean company sooam biotech was reported to be attempting to clone the dhole using dogs as surrogate mothers to help conserve the species in culture and literature three animals are featured on the coping stone of the bharhut stupa dating from bc they are shown waiting by a tree with a woman or spirit trapped up it a scene reminiscent of dholes treeing tigers the animal fearsome reputation in india is reflected by the number of pejorative names it possesses in hindi which variously translate as red devil devil dog jungle devil or hound of kali according to zoologist and explorer leopold von schrenck he had trouble obtaining dhole specimens during his exploration of amurland as the local gilyaks greatly feared the species this fear and superstition was not however shared by neighbouring tungusic peoples von schrenk speculated that this differing attitude towards dholes was due to the tungusic people more nomadic lifestyle animals are described in numerous old european texts including the ostrogoth sagas where they are portrayed as hellhounds the demon dogs accompanying hellequin in mediaeval french passion plays as well as the ones inhabiting the legendary forest of broceliande have been attributed to dholes according to charles hamilton smith the dangerous wild canids mentioned by scaliger as having lived in the forests of montefalcone could have been based on dholes as they were described as unlike wolves in habits voice and appearance the montefalcone family coat of arms had a pair of red dogs as supportersdholes appear in rudyard kipling red dog where they are portrayed as aggressive and bloodthirsty animals which descend from the deccan plateau into the seeonee hills inhabited by mowgli and his adopted wolf pack to cause carnage among the jungle denizens they are described as living in packs numbering hundreds of individuals and that even shere khan and hathi make way for them when they descend into the jungle the dholes are despised by the wolves because of their destructiveness their habit of not living in dens and the hair between their toes with mowgli and kaa help the seeonee wolf pack manages to wipe out the dholes by leading them through bee hives and torrential waters before finishing off the rest in battle japanese author uchida roan wrote Quan Wu Yu  inu monogatari a dog tale in as a nationalistic critique of the declining popularity of indigenous dog breeds which he asserted were descended from the dhole a fictional version of the dhole imbued with supernatural abilities appears in the season episode of tv series the titled alpha dholes also appear as enemies in the video game far cry alongside other predators such as the bengal tiger honey badger snow leopard clouded leopard tibetan wolf and asian black bear they can be found hunting the player and other npcs across the map but are easily killed being one of the weakest enemies in the game they once again appear in the video game far cry primal where they play similar roles as their counterparts in the previous game but can now also be tamed and used in combat by takkar the main protagonist of the game tameability brian houghton hodgson kept captured dholes in captivity and found with the exception of one animal they remained shy and vicious even after months according to richard lydekker adult dholes are nearly impossible to tame though pups are docile and can even be allowed to play with domestic dog pups until they reach early adulthood a dhole may have
