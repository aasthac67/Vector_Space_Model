a camel is an ungulate in the genus camelus that bears distinctive fatty deposits known as humps on its back camels have long been domesticated and as livestock they provide food milk and meat and textiles fiber and felt from hair camels are working animals especially suited to their desert habitat and are a vital means of transport for passengers and cargo there are three surviving species of camel the dromedary makes up of the world camel population and the bactrian camel makes up the wild bactrian camel is a separate species and is now critically endangered the word camel is also used informally in a wider sense where the more correct term is camelid to include all seven species of the family camelidae the true camels the above three species along with the new world camelids the llama the alpaca the guanaco and the vicuna the word itself is derived via latin camelus and greek kamelos kamelos from hebrew arabic or phoenician gamal taxonomy extant species species are extant recently extinct species an extinct species of camel in the separate genus camelops known as c hesternus lived in western north america until the end of the pleistocene roughly years ago biology the average life expectancy of a camel is to years a adult dromedary camel stands m ft in at the shoulder and m ft in at the hump bactrian camels can be a foot taller camels can run at up to mph in short bursts and sustain speeds of up to mph bactrian camels weigh to kg to lb and dromedaries to kg to lb the widening toes on a camel hoof provide supplemental grip for varying soil sedimentsthe male dromedary camel has an organ called a dulla in its throat a large inflatable sac he extrudes from his mouth when in rut to assert dominance and attract females it resembles a long swollen pink tongue hanging out of the side of its mouth camels mate by having both male and female sitting on the ground with the male mounting from behind the male usually ejaculates three or four times within a single mating session camelids are the only ungulates to mate in a sitting position ecological and behavioral adaptations camels do not directly store water in their humps they are reservoirs of fatty tissue concentrating body fat in their humps minimizes the insulating effect fat would have if distributed over the rest of their bodies helping camels survive in hot climates when this tissue is metabolized it yields more than one gram of water for every gram of fat processed this fat metabolization while releasing energy causes water to evaporate from the lungs during respiration as oxygen is required for the metabolic process overall there is a net decrease in water camels have a series of physiological adaptations that allow them to withstand long periods of time without any external source of water the dromedary camel can drink as seldom as once every days even under very hot conditions and can lose up to of its body mass due to dehydration unlike other mammals camels red blood cells are oval rather than circular in shape this facilitates the flow of red blood cells during dehydration and makes them better at withstanding high osmotic variation without rupturing when drinking large amounts of water a kg lb camel can drink l us gal of water in three minutescamels are able to withstand changes in body temperature and water consumption that would kill most other mammals their temperature ranges from at dawn and steadily increases to by sunset before they cool off at night again in general to compare between camels and the other livestock camels lose only liters of fluid intake every day while the other livestock lose to liters per day breulmann et al maintaining the brain temperature within certain limits is critical for animals to assist this camels have a rete mirabile a complex of arteries and veins lying very close to each other which utilizes countercurrent blood flow to cool blood flowing to the brain camels rarely sweat even when ambient temperatures reach any sweat that does occur evaporates at the skin level rather than at the surface of their coat the heat of vaporization therefore comes from body heat rather than ambient heat camels can withstand losing of their body weight to sweating whereas most other mammals can withstand only about dehydration before cardiac failure results from circulatory disturbancewhen the camel exhales water vapor becomes trapped in their nostrils and is reabsorbed into the body as a means to conserve water camels eating green herbage can ingest sufficient moisture in milder conditions to maintain their bodies hydrated state without the need for drinking the camel thick coat insulates it from the intense heat radiated from desert sand a shorn camel must sweat more to avoid overheating during the summer the coat becomes lighter in color reflecting light as well as helping avoid sunburn the camel long legs help by keeping its body farther from the ground which can heat up to dromedaries have a pad of thick tissue over the sternum called the pedestal when the animal lies down in a sternal recumbent position the pedestal raises the body from the hot surface and allows cooling air to pass under the bodycamels mouths have a thick leathery lining allowing them to chew thorny desert plants long eyelashes and ear hairs together with nostrils that can close form a barrier against sand if sand gets lodged in their eyes they can dislodge it using their transparent third eyelid the camels gait and widened feet help them move without sinking into the sandthe kidneys and intestines of a camel are very efficient at reabsorbing water camels kidneys have a cortex to medulla ratio thus the medullary part of a camel kidney occupies twice as much area as a cow kidney secondly renal corpuscles have a smaller diameter which reduces surface area for filtration these two major anatomical characteristics enable camels to conserve water and limit the volume of urine in extreme desert conditions camel urine comes out as a thick syrup and camel faeces are so dry that they do not require drying when the bedouins use them to fuel firesthe camel immune system differs from those of other mammals normally the antibody molecules consist of two heavy or long chains along the length of the y and two light or short chains at each tip of the y camels in addition to these also have antibodies made of only two heavy chains a trait that makes them smaller and more durable these antibodies discovered in are thought to have developed million years ago after camelids split from ruminants and pigs genetics the karyotypes of different camelid species have been studied earlier by many groups but no agreement on chromosome nomenclature of camelids has been reached a study flow sorted camel chromosomes building on the fact that camels have pairs of chromosomes and found that the karyotype consisted of one metacentric three submetacentric and acrocentric autosomes the y is a small metacentric chromosome while the x is a large metacentric chromosome the hybrid camel a hybrid between bactrian and dromedary camels has one hump though it has an indentation cm in deep that divides the front from the back the hybrid is m ft in at the shoulder and m ft in tall at the hump it weighs an average of kg lb and can carry around to kg to lb which is more than either the dromedary or bactrian canaccording to molecular data the wild bactrian camel c ferus separated from the domestic bactrian camel c bactrianus about million years ago new world and old world camelids diverged about million years ago in spite of this these species can hybridize and produce viable offspring the cama is a hybrid bred by scientists to see how closely related the parent species are scientists collected semen from a camel via an artificial vagina and inseminated a llama after stimulating ovulation with gonadotrophin injections the cama is halfway in size between a camel and a llama and lacks a hump it has ears intermediate between those of camels and llamas longer legs than the llama and partially cloven hooves like the mule camas are sterile despite both parents having the same number of chromosomes evolution the earliest known camel called protylopus lived in north america to million years ago during the eocene it was about the size of a rabbit and lived in the open woodlands of what is now south dakota by million years ago the poebrotherium was the size of a goat and had many more traits similar to camels and llamas the hoofed stenomylus which walked on the tips of its toes also existed around this time and the aepycamelus evolved in the miocenean early relative of extant old world camels paracamelus existed in the upper miocene to middle pleistocene around million years ago the north american camelidae spread to south america as part of the great american interchange via the newly formed isthmus of panama where they gave rise to guanacos and related animals and to asia via the bering land bridge surprising finds of fossil paracamelus on ellesmere island beginning in in the high canadian arctic suggest that the extant old world camels may descend from a larger boreal browser whose hump may have evolved as an adaptation in a cold climate this creature is estimated to have stood around nine feet metres tall the bactrican camel diverged from the dromedary about million years ago according to the fossil recordthe last camel native to north america was camelops hesternus which vanished along with horses bears mammoths and mastodons ground sloths sabertooth cats and many other megafauna coinciding with the migration of humans from asia domestication like horses before their extinction in their continent of origin camels spread across beringia moving in the opposite direction from the asian immigration to america they survived in the old world and eventually humans domesticated them and spread them globally along with many other megafauna in north america the original wild camels were wiped out during the spread of the first indigenous peoples of the americas from asia into north america years ago although fossils have never been associated with definitive evidence of huntingmost camels surviving today are domesticated although feral populations exist in australia india and kazakhstan wild camels survive only in the wild bactrian camel population of the gobi deserthumans may have first domesticated dromedaries in somalia and southern arabia around bce and bactrian camels in central asia around bce as at sukhteh also known as the burnt city iranmartin heide work on the domestication of the camel tentatively concludes that humans had domesticated the bactrian camel by at least the middle of the third millennium somewhere east of the zagros mountains with the practice then moving into mesopotamia heide suggests that mentions of camels in the patriarchal narratives may refer at least in some places to the bactrian camel while noting that the camel is not mentioned in relationship to canaanrecent excavations in the timna valley by lidar and erez discovered what may be the earliest domestic camel bones yet found in israel or even outside the arabian peninsula dating to around bc this garnered considerable media coverage as it is strong evidence that the stories of abraham jacob esau and joseph were written after this timethe existence of camels in not in the eastern mediterranean not a new idea the historian richard bulliet did not think that the occasional mention of camels in the bible meant that the domestic camels were common in the holy land at that time the archaeologist william f albright writing even earlier saw camels in the bible as an anachronismthe official report by and notes the introduction of the dromedary camel camelus dromedarius as a pack animal to the southern levant substantially facilitated trade across the vast deserts of arabia promoting both economic and social change eg kohler borowski jasmin this has generated extensive discussion regarding the date of the earliest domestic camel in the southern levant and beyond eg albright epstein bulliet zarins uerpmann and uerpmann jasmin heide rosen and saidel grigson most scholars today agree that the dromedary was exploited as a pack animal sometime in the early iron age not before the century bc and concludes current data from copper smelting sites of the aravah valley enable us to pinpoint the introduction of domestic camels to the southern levant more precisely based on stratigraphic contexts associated with an extensive suite of radiocarbon dates the data indicate that this event occurred not earlier than the last third of the century bc and most probably during this time the coincidence of this event with a major reorganization of the copper industry of the to the results of the campaign of pharaoh shoshenq the possibility that the two were connected and that camels were introduced as part of the efforts to improve efficiency by facilitating trade textiles desert tribes and mongolian nomads use camel hair for tents yurts clothing bedding and accessories camels have outer guard hairs and soft inner down and the fibers are sorted by color and age of the animal the guard hairs can be felted for use as waterproof coats for the herdsmen while the softer hair is used for premium goods the fiber can be spun for use in weaving or made into yarns for hand knitting or crochet pure camel hair is recorded as being used for western garments from the century onwards and from the century a mixture of wool and camel hair was used military uses by at least bc the first camel saddles had appeared and bactrian camels could be ridden the first saddle was positioned to the back of the camel and control of the bactrian camel was exercised by means of a stick however between and bc bactrian camels came into military use new saddles which were inflexible and bent were put over the humps and divided the rider weight over the animal in the seventh century bc the military arabian saddle evolved which again improved the saddle design slightlymilitary forces have used camel cavalries in wars throughout africa the middle east and into the border security force bsf of india though as of july the bsf planned the replacement of camels with atvs the first documented use of camel cavalries occurred in the battle of qarqar in bc armies have also used camels as freight animals instead of horses and mulesthe east roman empire used auxiliary forces known as dromedarii whom the romans recruited in desert provinces the camels were used mostly in combat because of their ability to scare off horses at close range horses are afraid of the camels scent a quality famously employed by the achaemenid persians when fighting lydia in the battle of thymbra bc and centuries the united states army established the us camel corps stationed in california in the late century one may still see stables at the benicia arsenal in benicia california where they nowadays serve as the benicia historical museum though the experimental use of camels was seen as a success john b floyd secretary of war in recommended that funds be allocated towards obtaining a thousand more camels the outbreak of the american civil war in saw the end of the camel corps texas became part of the confederacy and most of the camels were left to wander away into the desertfrance created a mehariste camel corps in as part of the armee in the sahara in order to exercise greater control over the tuareg and arab insurgents as previous efforts to defeat them on foot had failed the free french camel corps fought during world war ii and units remained in service until the end of french rule over algeria in the british created the imperial camel corps it was originally used to fight the senussi but was later used in the sinai and palestine campaign in world war i the imperial camel corps comprised infantrymen mounted on camels for movement across desert though they dismounted at battle sites and fought on foot after july the corps began to become run down receiving no new reinforcements and was formally disbanded in world war i the british army also created the egyptian camel transport corps which consisted of a group of egyptian camel drivers and their camels the corps supported british war operations in sinai palestine and syria by transporting supplies to the troopsthe somaliland camel corps was created by colonial authorities in british somaliland in it was disbanded in camels were used by romanian forces during world war ii in the caucasian region at the same period the soviet units operating around astrakhan in adopted local camels as draft animals due to shortage of trucks and horses and kept them even after moving out of the area despite severe losses some of these camels came as far west as to berlin itselfthe bikaner camel corps of british india fought alongside the british indian army in world wars i and iithe tropas nomadas nomad troops were an auxiliary regiment of sahrawi tribesmen serving in the colonial army in spanish sahara today western sahara operational from the until the end of the spanish presence in the territory in the tropas nomadas were equipped with small arms and led by spanish officers the unit guarded outposts and sometimes conducted patrols on camelback food uses dairy camel milk is a staple food of desert nomad tribes and is sometimes considered a meal itself a nomad can live on only camel milk for almost a monthcamel milk can readily be made into yogurt but can only be made into butter if it is soured first churned and a clarifying agent is then added until recently camel milk could not be made into camel cheese because rennet was unable to coagulate the milk proteins to allow the collection of curds developing less wasteful uses of the milk the fao commissioned professor jp ramet of the ecole nationale superieure et des industries alimentaires who was able to produce curdling by the addition of calcium phosphate and vegetable rennet in the the cheese produced from this process has low levels of cholesterol and is easy to digest even for the lactose intolerantcamel milk can also be made into ice cream meat they provide food in the form of meat and milk tariq et approximately million camels and camelids are slaughtered each year for meat worldwide a camel carcass can provide a substantial amount of meat the male dromedary carcass can weigh kg lb while the carcass of a male bactrian can weigh up to kg lb the carcass of a female dromedary weighs less than the male ranging between and kg and lb the brisket ribs and loin are among the preferred parts and the hump is considered a delicacy the hump contains white and sickly fat which can be used to make the khli preserved meat of mutton beef or camel on the other hand camel milk and meat are rich in protein vitamins glycogen and other nutrients making them essential in the diet of many people from chemical composition to meat quality the dromedary camel is the preferred breed for meat production it does well even in arid areas due to its unusual physiological behaviors and characteristics which include tolerance to extreme temperatures radiation from the sun water paucity rugged landscape and low vegetation camel meat is reported to taste like coarse beef but older camels can prove to be very tough although camel meat becomes tenderer the more it is cooked the abu dhabi officers club serves a camel burger mixed with beef or lamb fat in order to improve the texture and taste in karachi pakistan some restaurants prepare nihari from camel meat specialist camel butchers provide expert cuts with the hump considered the most popularcamel meat has been eaten for centuries it has been recorded by ancient greek writers as an available dish at banquets in ancient persia usually roasted whole the roman emperor heliogabalus enjoyed camel heel camel meat is mainly eaten in certain regions including eritrea somalia djibouti saudi arabia egypt syria libya sudan ethiopia kazakhstan and other arid regions where alternative forms of protein may be limited or where camel meat has had a long cultural history camel blood is also consumable as is the case among pastoralists in northern kenya where camel blood is drunk with milk and acts as a key source of iron vitamin d salts and mineralsa report issued jointly by the saudi ministry of health and the united states centers for disease control and prevention details four cases of human bubonic plague resulting from the ingestion of raw camel liver australia camel meat is also occasionally found in australian cuisine for example a camel lasagna is available in alice springs australia has exported camel meat primarily to the middle east but also to europe and the us for many years the meat is very popular among north african australians such as somalis and other australians have also been buying it the feral nature of the animals means they produce a different type of meat to farmed camels in other parts of the world and it is sought after because it is and a unique genetic group demand is outstripping supply and governments are being urged not to cull the camels but redirect the cost of the cull into developing the market australia has seven camel dairies which produce milk cheese and skincare products in addition to meat religion islam camel meat is halal arabic for muslims however according to some islamic schools of thought a state of impurity is brought on by the consumption of it consequently these schools hold that muslims must perform wudhu ablution before the next time they pray after eating camel meat also some islamic schools of thought consider it haram arabic for a muslim to perform salat in places where camels lie as it is said to be a dwelling place of the shaytan arabic according to abu yusuf the urine of camel may be used for medical treatment if necessary but according to abu hanifah the drinking of camel urine is discouragedthe islamic texts contain several stories featuring camels in the story of the people of thamud the prophet salih miraculously brings forth a naqat arabic out of a rock after the prophet muhammad migrated from mecca to medina he allowed his to roam there the location where the camel stopped to rest determined the location where he would build his house in medina judaism according to jewish tradition camel meat and milk are not kosher camels possess only one of the two kosher criteria although they chew their cud they do not possess cloven hooves but these you shall not eat among those that bring up the cud and those that have a cloven hoof the camel because it brings up its cud but does not have a completely cloven hoof it is unclean for you depictions in culture distribution and numbers there are around million camels alive as of with being dromedaries dromedaries alive today are domesticated animals mostly living in the horn of africa the sahel maghreb middle east and south asia the horn region alone has the largest concentration of camels in the world where the dromedaries constitute an important part of local nomadic life they provide nomadic people in somalia and ethiopia with milk food and transportation around dromedary camels are now feral in australia descended from those introduced as a method of transport in the and early centuries this population is growing about per year representatives of the australian government have culled more than of the animals in part because the camels use too much of the limited resources needed by sheep farmersa small population of introduced camels dromedaries and bactrians wandered through southwestern united states after having been imported in the century as part of the us camel corps experiment when the project ended they were used as draft animals in mines and escaped or were released us camels were bought and exported to canada during the cariboo gold rushthe bactrian camel is as of reduced to an estimated million animals most of which are domesticated the wild bactrian camel is a separate species and is the only truly wild as opposed to feral camel in the world the wild camels are critically endangered and number approximately
