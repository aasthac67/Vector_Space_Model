duck is the common name for numerous species in the waterfowl family anatidae which also includes swans and geese ducks are divided among several subfamilies in the family anatidae they do not represent a monophyletic group the group of all descendants of a single common ancestral species but a form taxon since swans and geese are not considered ducks ducks are mostly aquatic birds mostly smaller than the swans and geese and may be found in both fresh water and sea water ducks are sometimes confused with several types of unrelated water birds with similar forms such as loons or divers grebes gallinules and coots etymology the word duck comes from old english duce diver a derivative of the verb ducan to duck bend down low as if to get under something or dive because of the way many species in the dabbling duck group feed by upending compare with dutch duiken and german tauchen to dive this word replaced old english duck possibly to avoid confusion with other old english words like ende end with similar forms other germanic languages still have similar words for duck for example dutch eend duck german ente duck and norwegian and duck the word was inherited from compare latin anas duck lithuanian antis duck ancient greek nessa netta duck and sanskrit ati water bird among others a duckling is a young duck in downy plumage or baby duck but in the food trade a young domestic duck which has just reached adult size and bulk and its meat is still fully tender is sometimes labelled as a duckling a male duck is called a drake and the female is called a duck or in ornithology a hen morphology the overall body plan of ducks is elongated and broad and the ducks are also relatively albeit not as as the geese and swans the body shape of diving ducks varies somewhat from this in being more rounded the bill is usually broad and contains serrated pectens which are particularly well defined in the species in the case of some fishing species the bill is long and strongly serrated the scaled legs are strong and well developed and generally set far back on the body more so in the highly aquatic species the wings are very strong and are generally short and pointed and the flight of ducks requires fast continuous strokes requiring in turn strong wing muscles three species of steamer duck are almost flightless however many species of duck are temporarily flightless while moulting they seek out protected habitat with good food supplies during this period this moult typically precedes migration the drakes of northern species often have extravagant plumage but that is moulted in summer to give a more appearance the eclipse plumage southern resident species typically show less sexual dimorphism although there are exceptions such as the paradise shelduck of new zealand which is both strikingly sexually dimorphic and in which the female plumage is brighter than that of the male the plumage of juvenile birds generally resembles that of the female over the course of evolution female ducks have evolved to have a corkscrew shaped vagina to prevent rape behaviour feeding ducks eat a variety of food sources such as grasses aquatic plants fish insects small amphibians worms and small molluscs dabbling ducks feed on the surface of water or on land or as deep as they can reach by without completely submerging along the edge of the beak there is a structure called a pecten this strains the water squirting from the side of the beak and traps any food the pecten is also used to preen feathers and to hold slippery food items diving ducks and sea ducks forage deep underwater to be able to submerge more easily the diving ducks are heavier than dabbling ducks and therefore have more difficulty taking off to fly a few specialized species such as the mergansers are adapted to catch and swallow large fish the others have the characteristic wide flat beak adapted to jobs such as pulling up waterweed pulling worms and small molluscs out of mud searching for insect larvae and bulk jobs such as dredging out holding turning head first and swallowing a squirming frog to avoid injury when digging into sediment it has no cere but the nostrils come out through hard horn the guardian british newspaper published an article advising that ducks should not be fed with bread because it damages the health of the ducks and pollutes waterways breeding ducks generally only have one partner at a time although the partnership usually only lasts one year larger species and the more sedentary species like specialists tend to have that last numerous years most duck species breed once a year choosing to do so in favourable conditions or wet seasons ducks also tend to make a nest before breeding and after hatching lead their ducklings to water mother ducks are very caring and protective of their young but may abandon some of their ducklings if they are physically stuck in an area they can not get out of such as nesting in an enclosed courtyard or are not prospering due to genetic defects or sickness brought about by hypothermia starvation or disease ducklings can also be orphaned by inconsistent late hatching where a few eggs hatch after the mother has abandoned the nest and led her ducklings to water most domestic ducks neglect their eggs and ducklings and their eggs must be hatched under a broody hen or artificially communication female mallard ducks as well as several other species in the genus anas such as the american and pacific black ducks make the classic quack sound while males make a similar but raspier sound that is sometimes written as breeeeze but despite widespread misconceptions most species of duck do not quack in general ducks make a wide range of calls ranging from whistles cooing yodels and grunts for example the scaup which are diving ducks make a noise like scaup hence their name calls may be loud displaying calls or quieter contact calls a common urban legend claims that duck quacks do not echo however this has been proven to be false this myth was first debunked by the acoustics research centre at the university of salford in as part of the british association festival of science it was also debunked in one of the earlier episodes of the popular discovery channel television show mythbusters distribution and habitat the ducks have a cosmopolitan distribution a number of species manage to live on islands like south georgia and the auckland islands numerous ducks have managed to establish themselves on oceanic islands such as hawaii new zealand and kerguelen although many of these species and populations are threatened or have become extinct some duck species mainly those breeding in the temperate and arctic northern hemisphere are migratory those in the tropics however are generally not some ducks particularly in australia where rainfall is patchy and erratic are nomadic seeking out the temporary lakes and pools that form after localised heavy rain predators worldwide ducks have many predators ducklings are particularly vulnerable since their inability to fly makes them easy prey not only for predatory birds but also for large fish like pike crocodilians predatory testudines such as the alligator snapping turtle and other aquatic hunters including birds such as herons ducks nests are raided by predators and brooding females may be caught unaware on the nest by mammals such as foxes or large birds such as hawks or owls adult ducks are fast fliers but may be caught on the water by large aquatic predators including big fish such as the north american muskie and the european pike in flight ducks are safe from all but a few predators such as humans and the peregrine falcon which regularly uses its speed and strength to catch ducks relationship with humans domestication ducks have many economic uses being farmed for their meat eggs and feathers particularly their down approximately billion ducks are slaughtered each year for meat worldwide they are also kept and bred by aviculturists and often displayed in zoos almost all the varieties of domestic ducks are descended from the mallard anas platyrhynchos apart from the muscovy duck cairina moschata the call duck is another example of a domestic duck breed its name comes from its original use established by hunters as a decoy to attract wild mallards from the sky into traps set for them on the ground the call duck is the world smallest domestic duck breed as it weighs less than kg lb hunting in many areas wild ducks of various species including ducks farmed and released into the wild are hunted for food or sport by shooting or formerly by being trapped using duck decoys because an idle floating duck or a duck squatting on land can not react to fly or move quickly a sitting duck has come to mean an easy target these ducks may be contaminated by pollutants such as pcbs cultural references in psychologist richard wiseman and colleagues at the university of hertfordshire uk finished a laughlab experiment concluding that of all animals ducks attract the most humor and silliness he said if you going to tell a joke involving an animal make it a duck the word duck may have become an inherently funny word in many languages possibly because ducks are seen as silly in their looks or behavior of the many ducks in fiction many are cartoon characters such as walt disney donald duck and warner bros daffy duck howard the duck started as a comic book character in and was made into a movie in the disney film the mighty ducks starring emilio estevez chose the duck as the mascot for the fictional youth hockey team who are protagonists of the movie based on the duck being described as a fierce fighter this led to the duck becoming the nickname and mascot for the eventual national hockey league professional team anaheim ducks the duck is also the nickname of the university of oregon sports teams as well as the long island ducks
