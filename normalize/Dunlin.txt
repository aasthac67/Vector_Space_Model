the dunlin calidris alpina is a small wader sometimes separated with the other stints in erolia the english name is a dialect form of dunling first recorded in it derives from dun dull brown with the suffix meaning a person or thing with the given quality the genus name is from ancient greek kalidris or skalidris a term used by aristotle for some waterside birds the specific alpina is from latin and means of high mountains in this case referring to the alpsit is a circumpolar breeder in arctic or subarctic regions birds that breed in northern europe and asia are migrants wintering south to africa southeast asia and the middle east birds that breed in alaska and the canadian arctic migrate short distances to the pacific and atlantic coasts of north america although those nesting in northern alaska overwinter in asia many dunlins winter along the iberian south coast description an adult dunlin in breeding plumage shows the distinctive black belly which no other wader possesses the winter dunlin is basically grey above and white below juveniles are brown above with two whitish v shapes on the back they usually have black marks on the flanks or belly and show a strong white wingbar in flight the legs and slightly decurved bill are black there are a number of subspecies differing mainly in the extent of rufous colouration in the breeding plumage and the bill length bill length varies between sexes the females having longer bills than the males on the tip of the dunlin bill is a soft covering that fills with blood and with many nerve endings forming a sensitive probe that is used to locate invertebrate prey in mud and sand although the bill can look in dead specimens in life it is blunt subspecies c a arctica schioler breeds in northeast greenland c a schinzii brehm schilling breeds in southeast greenland iceland the british isles scandinavia the baltic c a alpina linnaeus breeds in northern europe and northwest siberia c a centralis buturlin breeds in and northeast siberia c a sakhalina vieillot breeds in eastern russia to the chukchi peninsula c a kistchinski tomkovich breeds around the sea of okhotsk to kuril islands and kamchatka c a actites nechaev tomkovich breeds on sakhalin c a arcticola todd breeds from northwest alaska to northwest canada c a pacifica coues breeds in western and southern alaska c a hudsonia todd breeds in central canada nesting the nest is a shallow scrape on the ground lined with vegetation into which typically four eggs are laid and incubated by the male and female parents chicks are precocial however are brooded during early development they start to fly at approximately three weeks of age the majority of brood care is provided by the male as the female deserts the brood and often leaves the breeding area the call is a typical sandpiper peep and the display song a harsh trill the dunlin is one of the species to which the agreement on the conservation of migratory waterbirds aewa applies apparent hybrids between this species and the sandpiper as well as with the purple sandpiper have been reported from the atlantic coasts of north america and europe respectively behaviour the dunlin is highly gregarious in winter sometimes forming large flocks on coastal mudflats or sandy beaches large numbers can often be seen swirling in synchronized flight on during migration or on their winter habitat this bird is one of the most common waders throughout its breeding and wintering ranges and it is the species with which other waders tend to be compared at cm in length and with a cm in wingspan it is similar in size to a common starling but stouter with a thicker bill the dunlin moves along the coastal mudflat beaches it prefers with a characteristic sewing machine feeding action methodically picking small food items insects form the main part of the dunlin diet on the nesting grounds it eats molluscs worms and crustaceans in coastal areas dunlin are small migratory waders however they show strong philopatry with individuals of the southern dunlin calidris alpina schinzii in sweden and finland returning to or very close to their natal patches habitat fragmentation has reduced the availability of habitat patches to these birds through reducing patch size and increasing patch isolation this reduced connectivity between patches has reduced the movements of dunlin leaving them more susceptible to inbreeding in these locations future management for the conservation of southern dunlin should include increasing the connectivity between habitat patches references external links
