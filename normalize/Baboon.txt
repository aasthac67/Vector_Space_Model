baboons are primates comprising the genus papio one of the genera of old world monkeys there are five species of baboons commonly known as hamadryas baboon guinea baboon olive baboon yellow baboon and chacma baboon each species is native to one of five areas of africa and the hamadryas baboon is also native to part of the arabian peninsula baboons are among the largest primates and have existed for at least two million years baboons vary in size and weight depending on the species the smallest the kinda baboon is cm in in length and weighs only kg lb while the largest the chacma baboon is up to cm in in length and weighs kg lb all baboons have long muzzles heavy powerful jaws with sharp canine teeth eyes thick fur except on their muzzles short tails and nerveless hairless pads of skin on their protruding buttocks called ischial callosities that provide for sitting comfort male hamadryas baboons have large white manes baboons exhibit sexual dimorphism in size colour canine teeth development baboons have diurnality and are terrestrial but sleep in trees or on high cliffs or rocks at night away from predators they are found in open savannahs and woodlands across africa they are omnivorous common sources of food are grasses seeds roots leaves bark various fruits insects fish shellfish rodents birds vervet monkeys and small antelopes their principal predators are nile crocodiles leopards lions and hyenas most baboons live in hierarchical troops containing harems baboons can determine from vocal exchanges what the dominance relations are between individuals in general each male can mate with any female the mating order among the males depends partly on their social rank females typically give birth after a gestation usually to one infant the females tend to be the primary caretaker of the young although several females may share the duties for all of their offspring offspring are weaned after about a year they reach sexual maturity around five to eight years males leave their birth group usually before they reach sexual maturity whereas most females stay in the same group for their lives baboons in captivity live up to years while in the wild they average between to years taxonomy five species of papio are commonly recognized although there is some disagreement about whether they are really full species or subspecies they are p ursinus chacma baboon found in southern africa p papio western red or guinea baboon found in the far western africa p hamadryas hamadryas baboon found in the horn of africa and southwestern arabia p anubis olive baboon found in the african savanna and p cynocephalus yellow baboon found in and eastern africa the five species of baboons in the genus papio are hamadryas baboon papio hamadryas guinea baboon papio papio olive baboon papio anubis yellow baboon papio cynocephalus central yellow baboon papio cynocephalus cynocephalus ibean baboon papio cynocephalus ibeanus kinda baboon papio cynocephalus kindae chacma baboon papio ursinus cape chacma papio ursinus ursinus chacma papio ursinus griseipes ruacana chacma papio ursinus raucanamany authors distinguish p hamadryas as a full species but regard all the others as subspecies of p cynocephalus and refer to them collectively as savanna baboons this may not be helpful it is based on the argument that the hamadryas baboon is behaviorally and physically distinct from other baboon species and that this reflects a separate evolutionary history however recent morphological and genetic studies of papio show the hamadryas baboon to be more closely related to the northern baboon species the guinea and olive baboons than to the southern species the yellow and chacma baboons the traditional classification probably the variation within papio some commentators argue that at least two more forms should be recognized including the tiny kinda baboon p cynocephalus kindae from zambia dr congo and angola and the baboon p ursinus griseipes found in zambia botswana zimbabwe mozambique and northern south africa however current knowledge of the morphological genetic and behavioral diversity within papio is too poor to make any final comprehensive judgment on this matter phylogeny in researchers found the oldest baboon fossil dating million years ago characteristics all baboons have long muzzles heavy powerful jaws with sharp canine teeth eyes thick fur except on their muzzles short tails and rough spots on their protruding buttocks called ischial callosities these calluses are nerveless hairless pads of skin that provide for the sitting comfort of the baboon all baboon species exhibit pronounced sexual dimorphism usually in size but also sometimes in colour or canine development males of the hamadryas baboon species also have large white manes behavior and ecology baboons are able to acquire orthographic processing skills which form part of the ability to read habitat and prey baboons are terrestrial ground dwelling and are found in open savannah open woodland and hills across africa their diets are omnivorous they eat grasses roots seeds leaves fruits insects fish shellfish rodents birds vervet monkeys and small antelopes they are foragers and are active at irregular times throughout the day and night they often raid human dwellings and in south africa they have been known to prey on sheep goats and poultry predators their principal predators are nile crocodiles lions spotted and striped hyenas leopards and cheetahs they are considered a difficult prey for the leopard though which is mostly a threat to young baboons large males will often confront them by flashing their eyelids showing their teeth by yawning making gestures and chasing after the although they are not a prey species baboons have been killed by the black mamba snake this usually occurs when a baboon accidentally rouses the snake social systems the collective noun for baboons is troop most baboons live in hierarchical troops group sizes are typically around animals but can vary between and depending on species location and time of year the structure within the troop varies considerably between hamadryas baboons and the remaining species sometimes collectively referred to as savanna baboons the hamadryas baboons often appear in very large groups composed of many smaller harems one male with four or so females to which females from elsewhere in the troop are recruited while they are still too young to breed other baboon species have a more promiscuous structure with a strict dominance hierarchy based on the matriline the hamadryas baboon group will typically include a younger male but he will not attempt to mate with the females unless the older male is removed in the harems of the hamadryas baboons the males jealously guard their females to the point of grabbing and biting the females when they wander too far away despite this some males will raid harems for females such situations often cause aggressive fights between the males visual threats usually accompany these aggressive fights these include a quick flashing of the eyelids accompanied by a yawn to show off the teeth some males succeed in taking a female from another harem called a takeover in several species infant baboons are taken by the males as hostages or used as shields during fights baboons can determine from vocal exchanges what the dominance relations are between individuals when a confrontation occurs between different families or where a baboon takes the offensive baboons show more interest in this exchange than those between members of the same family or when a baboon takes the offensive this is because confrontations between different families or rank challenges can have a wider impact on the whole troop than an internal conflict in a family or a baboon reinforcing its dominancebaboon social dynamics can also vary robert sapolsky reported on a troop known as the forest troop during the which experienced significantly less aggressive social dynamics after its most aggressive males died off during a tuberculosis outbreak leaving a skewed gender ration of majority females and a minority of males this relatively culture persisted into the and extended to new males coming into the troop though sapolsky observed that while unique the troop was a not an unrecognizably different utopia there was still a dominance hierarchy and aggressive intrasexual competition amongst males furthermore no new behaviours were created amongst the baboons rather the difference was the frequency and context of existing baboon behaviour mating baboon mating behavior varies greatly depending on the social structure of the troop in the mixed groups of savanna baboons each male can mate with any female the mating order among the males depends partially on their social ranking and fights between males are not unusual there are however more subtle possibilities in mixed groups males sometimes try to win the friendship of females to garner this friendship they may help groom the female help care for her young or supply her with food the probability is high that those young are their offspring some females clearly prefer such friendly males as mates however males will also take infants during fights to protect themselves from harm a female initiates mating by presenting her swollen rump to the male face birth rearing young and life expectancy females typically give birth after a gestation usually to a single infant twin baboons are rare and often do not survive the young baboon weighs approximately g and has a black epidermis when born the females tend to be the primary caretaker of the young although several females will share the duties for all of their offspring after about one year the young animals are weaned they reach sexual maturity in five to eight years baboon males leave their birth group usually before they reach sexual maturity whereas females are philopatric and stay in the same group their whole lives baboons in captivity have been known to live up to years while in the wild their life expectancy is between to years relationship with humans in egyptian
