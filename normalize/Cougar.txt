the cougar puma concolor is a large cat of the subfamily felinae it is native to the americas its range spans from the canadian yukon to the southern andes in south america and is the widest of any large wild terrestrial mammal in the western hemisphere it is an adaptable generalist species occurring in most american habitat types due to its wide range it has many names including puma mountain lion panther painter and catamount it is the cat in the new world after the jaguar secretive and largely solitary by nature the cougar is properly considered both nocturnal and crepuscular although daytime sightings do occur the cougar is more closely related to smaller felines including the domestic cat than to any species of subfamily pantherinae of which only the jaguar is extant in the americas the cougar is an ambush predator that pursues a wide variety of prey primary food sources are ungulates particularly deer it also hunts species as small as insects and rodents this cat prefers habitats with dense underbrush and rocky areas for stalking but can also live in open areas the cougar is territorial and survives at low population densities individual territory sizes depend on terrain vegetation and abundance of prey while large it is not always the apex predator in its range yielding prey it has killed to jaguars american black bears grizzly bears american alligators florida panther predation mainly and to groups of gray wolves or coyotes it is reclusive and mostly avoids people fatal attacks on humans are rare but have recently been increasing in north america as more people enter cougar territories and build developments such as farms in their established territory intensive hunting following european colonization of the americas and the ongoing human development into cougar habitat has caused populations to drop in most parts of its historical range in particular the north american cougar is considered to have been mostly extirpated in eastern north america the population referred to as the eastern cougar in the beginning of the century except for the isolated florida panther subpopulation naming and etymology the word is borrowed from the portuguese cucuarana via french it was originally derived from the tupi language a current form in brazil is sucuarana in the century georg marcgrave named it cuguacu ara marcgrave rendering was reproduced in by his associate willem piso cuguacu ara was then adopted by john ray in in leclerc comte de buffon converted cuguacu ara to cuguar which was later modified to cougar in englishpuma is the common name used in latin america and most parts of europe the term puma is also used in the united states the first use of in english dates to introduced from spanish and prior from the peruvian quechua language in the century where it means powerful in the united states and canada it is also called mountain lion a name first used in writing in other names include panther painter and catamount early spanish explorers of the americas called it monte meaning cat of the mountain and meaning lionthe cougar holds the guinness record for the animal with the greatest number of names with over in english alone taxonomy and evolution felis concolor was the scientific name proposed by carl linnaeus in for a cat with a long tail from brasilia it was placed in the genus puma by william jardine in this genus is part of the felinae the cougar is most closely related to the jaguarundi as well as the modern cheetah of africa and western asia subspecies following linnaeus first scientific description of the cougar cougar zoological specimens were described and proposed as subspecies until the late genetic analysis of cougar mitochondrial dna indicate that many of these are too similar to be recognized as distinct at a molecular level but that only six phylogeographic groups exist the florida panther samples showed a low microsatellite variation possibly due to inbreeding following this research the authors of mammal species of the world recognized the following six subspecies in p c concolor linnaeus includes the synonyms bangsi incarum osgoodi soasoaranna sussuarana soderstromii sucuacuara and wavula p c puma molina includes the synonyms araucanus concolor patagonica pearsoni and puma trouessart p c couguar kerr includes arundivaga aztecus browni californica floridana hippolestes improcera kaibabensis mayensis missoulensis olympus oregonensis schorgeri stanleyana vancouverensis and youngi p c costaricensis merriam p c anthonyi nelson and goldman includes acrocodia borbensis capricornensis concolor greeni and nigra p c cabrerae pocock includes hudsonii and puma proposed by marcelli in the florida panther was still referred to as a distinct subspecies p c coryi in research worksas of the cat classification taskforce of the cat specialist group recognizes only two subspecies as valid p c concolor in south america possibly excluding the region northwest of the andes and p c couguar in north and central america and possibly northwestern south america evolution the family felidae is believed to have originated in asia about million years ago taxonomic research on felids remains partial and much of what is known about their evolutionary history is based on mitochondrial dna analysis significant confidence intervals exist with suggested dates in the latest genomic study of the felidae the common ancestor of today leopardus lynx puma prionailurus and felis lineages migrated across the bering land bridge into the americas to million years ago mya the lineages subsequently diverged in that order north american felids then invaded south america mya as part of the great american interchange following formation of the isthmus of panama but the relationship is unresolved the cheetah lineage is suggested by some studies to have diverged from the puma lineage in the americas see american cheetah and migrated back to asia and africa while other research suggests the cheetah diverged in the old world itself a high level of genetic similarity has been found among north american cougar populations suggesting they are all fairly recent descendants of a small ancestral group culver et al propose the original north american cougar population was extirpated during the pleistocene extinctions some years ago when other large mammals such as smilodon also disappeared north america was then repopulated by south american cougarsa coprolite identified as from a cougar was excavated in argentina catamarca province and dated to years old it contained toxascaris leonina eggs this finding indicates that cougar and the parasite existed in south america since at least the late pleistocene characteristics the head of the cat is round and the ears are erect its powerful forequarters neck and jaw serve to grasp and hold large prey it has five retractable claws on its forepaws one a dewclaw and four on its hind paws the larger front feet and claws are adaptations to clutching preycougars are slender and agile members of the felidae they are the cat species worldwide adults stand about to cm to in tall at the shoulders adult males are around m ft long from nose to tail tip and females average m ft with overall ranges between to m to ft nose to tail suggested for the species in general of this length the tail typically accounts for to cm to in males generally weigh to kg to lb averaging kg lb females typically weigh between and kg and lb averaging kg lb cougar size is smallest close to the equator and larger towards the poles the largest recorded cougar shot in weighed kg lb claims of kg lb and kg lb have been reported though they were most likely exaggerated on average adult male cougars in british columbia weigh kg lb and adult females kg lb though several male cougars in british columbia weighed between and kg and lb depending on the locality cougars can be smaller or bigger than jaguars but are less muscular and not as powerfully built so their weight is on average less whereas cougars tend to be larger as distance increases from the equator which crosses the northern portion of south america jaguars are simply generally smaller north of the amazon river in south america and larger south of that river for example while south american jaguars are comparatively large and may exceed kg lb those in mexico biosphere reserve weigh about the same as female cougars approximately kg lb the cougar is on average larger than all felid species apart from the lion tiger and jaguar despite its size it is not typically classified among the big cats because it can not roar lacking the specialized larynx and hyoid apparatus of panthera compared to big cats cougars are often silent with minimal communication through vocalizations outside of the relationship cougars sometimes voice hisses growls and purrs as well as chirps and whistles many of which are comparable to those of domestic cats they are well known for their screams as referenced in some of their common names although these screams are often misinterpreted to be the calls of other animals or humanscougar coloring is plain hence the latin concolor but can vary greatly across individuals and even siblings the coat is typically tawny like that of the lion which is why it was initially called the mountain lion but it otherwise ranges from or reddish with lighter patches on the underbody including the jaws chin and throat infants are spotted and born with blue eyes and rings on their tails juveniles are pale and dark spots remain on their flanks despite anecdotes to the contrary coloring melanism has never been documented in cougars the term black panther is used colloquially to refer to melanistic individuals of other species particularly jaguars and leopards a leucistic individual was seen in serra dos orgaos national park in rio de janeiro in when it was recorded by way of a camera trap indicating that extremely rare pure white individual cougars do exist in the speciesthe cougar has large paws and proportionally the largest hind legs in felidae allowing for its great leaping and ability it is capable of leaping from the ground up to m high into a tree distribution and habitat the cougar has the largest range of any wild land animal in the americas its range spans degrees of latitude from northern yukon in canada to the southern andes its wide distribution stems from its adaptability to virtually every habitat type it lives in all forest types as well as in lowland and mountainous deserts but also in open areas with little vegetation in the santa ana mountains it prefers steep canyons escarpments rim rocks and dense brushthe cougar was extirpated across most of its eastern north american range with a notable exception of florida in the two centuries after european colonization and faced grave threats elsewhere it currently ranges across most western american states including occasional sightings from alaska the canadian provinces of alberta saskatchewan and british columbia and the canadian territory of yukon there have been widely debated reports of possible recolonization of eastern north america dna evidence has suggested its presence in eastern north america while a consolidated map of cougar sightings shows numerous reports from the great plains through to eastern canada the quebec wildlife services also considers cougars to be present in the province as a threatened species after multiple dna tests confirmed cougar hair in lynx mating sites the only unequivocally known eastern population is the critically endangered florida panther there have been unconfirmed sightings in elliotsville plantation maine north of monson and as early as in new hampshire in the michigan department of natural resources confirmed a cougar sighting in michigan upper peninsula typically sightings of cougars involve young males which can travel great distances to establish ranges away from established males all four confirmed cougar kills in iowa since involved maleson april police fatally shot a cougar on the north side of chicago illinois dna tests were consistent with cougars from the black hills of south dakota less than a year later on march a cougar was photographed and unsuccessfully tranquilized by state wildlife biologists in a tree near spooner wisconsin in the northwestern part of the state other eastern sightings since have occurred in locations such as greene county indiana greenwich and milford connecticut morgan county pike county and whiteside county illinois and bourbon county kentuckyin tennessee no confirmed sightings had been made since the early the first confirmed sighting in a century was made on september in obion county in the corner of west tennessee six days later and about km mi to the southeast a hair sample was found in carroll county dna analysis revealed that it was from a female genetically similar to south dakota cougars since then there have been at least eight additional confirmed sightings in the state all were immediately east of the tennessee river in middle tennessee initially in humphreys county and on september further south in wayne countysouth of the rio grande the international union for conservation of nature iucn lists the cat in every central and south american country while specific state and provincial statistics are often available in north america much less is known about the cat in its southern rangethe cougar total breeding population is estimated at less than by the iucn with a declining trend us statistics are often more optimistic suggesting cougar populations have rebounded in oregon a healthy population of was reported in exceeding a target of california has actively sought to protect the cat and has an estimated population of to study using cameras in rio los cipreses national reserve counted a population of two males and two females one of them with at least two cubs in an area of cougars per the bay area puma project aims to obtain information on cougar populations in the san francisco bay area and the animals interactions with habitat prey humans and residential communitiesit is speculated and believed by many that the western cougar is recolonizing the eastern cougar former range in the northeastern united states and there is growing evidence that supports this claim indicating a small but growing population of western cougars in the northeastern states mostly cougars migrating from the midwestern united states though possibly also from canada in april an experienced tracker named john mccarter found the mauled carcass of a beaver with scat nearby in the quabbin reservoir in massachusetts the scat was tested positive as being from a mountain lion in march steve ward a dcr forester in the state of massachusetts photographed tracks in the quabbin reservoir the tracks are believed to have been made by the same mountain lion that was seen in minnesota michigan upstate new york and connecticut before later being struck by an suv and killed in connecticut on a highway that same year the animal is believed to have originated from the black hills of south dakota mountain lions are well documented in the state of wisconsin with several confirmed sightings with photo and video evidence being as recent as august with many other sightings earlier that year and during the previous year of habitat fragmentation with the increase of human development and infrastructure growth in california the north american cougar populations are becoming more isolated from one another behavior and ecology aside from humans no species preys upon mature cougars in the wild although conflicts with other predators or scavengers occur of the large predators in yellowstone national park the grizzly bear the black bear the gray wolf and the cougar the massive grizzly bear appears dominant often but not always able to drive a gray wolf pack a black bear and a cougar off their kills one study found that grizzlies and american black bears visited of cougar kills in yellowstone and glacier national parks usurping of carcasses bears gained up to and cougars lost up to of their respective daily energy requirements from these encounters in colorado and california black bears were found to visit and of kills respectively in general cougars are subordinate to black bears when it comes to kills and when bears are most active the cats take prey more frequently and spend less time feeding on each kill unlike several subordinate predators from other ecosystems cougars do not appear to take advantage of spatial or temporal refuges to avoid their competitorsthe gray wolf and the cougar compete more directly for prey mostly in winter packs of wolves can steal cougars kills and there are some documented cases of cougars being killed by them one report describes a large pack of to wolves killing a female cougar and her kittens while in nearby sun valley idaho a male cougar was found dead apparently killed by wolf pack conversely confrontations tend to be dominated by the cat and there are various documented accounts where wolves have been ambushed and killed including adult male specimens wolves more broadly affect cougar population dynamics and distribution by dominating territory and prey opportunities and disrupting the feline behavior preliminary research in yellowstone for instance has shown displacement of the cougar by wolves one researcher in oregon noted when there is a pack around cougars are not comfortable around their kills or raising kittens a lot of times a big cougar will kill a wolf but the pack phenomenon changes the table both species are capable of killing predators such as bobcats canada lynx wolverines and coyotes and tend to suppress their numbers although cougars can kill coyotes the latter have been documented attempting to prey on cougar cubsalthough it is less specialized than other big cats in predation of crocodilians a case in florida was documented in where a cougar hunted a specimen of american alligator meters long the largest registered crocodilian taken by a cougar which suggests the ability of large cougars to prey on similar sized specimens of the remaining big crocodilian species with which they share habitat in different parts of the americas american crocodile black caiman and orinoco crocodile however adult specimens of the reptiles are big enough to prey on cougars in return if they have the chance which occurs only on rare occasions as the cougars tend to avoid bodies of water where crocodilians are present however there are documented cases of adult american alligators preying on cougars in florida in the southern portion of its range the cougar and jaguar share overlapping territory the jaguar tends to take the larger prey where ranges overlap reducing both the cougar potential size and the likelihood of direct competition between the two cats cougars appear better than jaguars at exploiting a broader prey niche and smaller preyas with any predator at or near the top of its food chain the cougar impacts the population of prey species predation by cougars has been linked to changes in the species mix of deer in a region for example a study in british columbia observed that the population of mule deer a favored cougar prey was declining while the population of the less frequently deer was increasing the vancouver island marmot an endangered species endemic to one region of dense cougar population has seen decreased numbers due to cougar and gray wolf predation nevertheless there is a measurable effect on the quality of deer populations by puma predationin the southern part of south america the cougar is a top level predator that has controlled the population of guanaco and other species since prehistoric times cougars also prey on bear cubs hunting and diet a successful generalist predator the cougar will eat any animal it can catch from insects to large ungulates over kg lb like other cats it is an obligate carnivore meaning it must feed on meat to survive the mean weight of vertebrate prey mwvp that pumas attack increases with the puma body weight in general mwvp is lower in areas closer to the equator its most important prey species are various deer species particularly in north america mule deer deer elk and even bull moose are taken other species such as the bighorn and dall sheep horse fallow deer caribou mountain goat coyote american badger and pronghorn a survey of north america research found of prey items were ungulates especially deer only the florida panther showed variation often preferring feral hogs and armadillos investigations at yellowstone national park showed that elk followed by mule deer were the cougar primary targets the prey base is shared with the park gray wolves with which the cougar competes for resources another study on winter kills in alberta showed that ungulates accounted for greater than of the cougar diet learned individual prey recognition was observed as some cougars rarely killed bighorn sheep while others relied heavily on the speciesin pacific rim national park reserve scat samples showed raccoons to make up of the cougar diet harbor seals and blacktail deer each north american river otters california sea lion and american mink the remaining were unidentifiedin the central and south american cougar range the ratio of deer in the diet declines small to mammals are preferred including large rodents such as the capybara ungulates accounted for only of prey items in one survey about half that of north america competition with the larger jaguar in south america has been suggested for the decline in the size of prey items however a study by and showed that the cougar and jaguar in central or north america may share the same prey depending on its abundance other listed prey species of the cougar include mice porcupines beavers raccoons hares guanaco peccary vicuna rhea and wild turkey birds and small reptiles are sometimes preyed upon in the south but this is rarely recorded in north americain patagonia monte leon national park the local cougar population has specialized on hunting penguinsalthough capable of sprinting the cougar is typically an ambush predator it stalks through brush and trees across ledges or other covered spots before delivering a powerful leap onto the back of its prey and a suffocating neck bite the cougar is capable of breaking the neck of some of its smaller prey with a strong bite and momentum bearing the animal to the ground kills are generally estimated around one large ungulate every two weeks the period shrinks for females raising young and may be as short as one kill every three days when cubs are nearly mature around months the cat drags a kill to a preferred spot covers it with brush and returns to feed over a period of days the cougar is generally reported to not be a scavenger but deer carcasses left exposed for study were scavenged by cougars in california suggesting more opportunistic behavior reproduction and life cycle females reach sexual maturity between to three years of age they typically average one litter every two to three years throughout their reproductive lives though the period can be as short as one year females are in estrus for about days of a cycle the gestation period is approximately days females are sometimes reported as monogamous but this is uncertain and polygyny may be more common copulation is brief but frequent chronic stress can result in low reproductive rates when in captivity as well as in the fieldonly females are involved in parenting litter size is between one and six cubs typically two caves and other alcoves that offer protection are used as litter dens born blind cubs are completely dependent on their mother at first and begin to be weaned at around three months of age as they grow they begin to go out on forays with their mother first visiting kill sites and after six months beginning to hunt small prey on their own kitten survival rates are just over one per litter newborn cougars have spots that fade and eventually disappear by the age of years juveniles remain with their mothers at least for two yearsyoung adults leave their mother to attempt to establish their own territories at around two years of age and sometimes earlier males tend to leave sooner one study has shown high mortality amongst cougars that travel farthest from the maternal range often due to conflicts with other cougars intraspecific competition research in new mexico has shown that males dispersed significantly farther than females were more likely to traverse large expanses of habitat and were probably most responsible for nuclear gene flow between habitat patches life expectancy in the wild is reported at eight to years and probably averages eight to a female of at least years was reported killed by hunters on vancouver island cougars may live as long as years in captivity causes of death in the wild include disability and disease competition with other cougars starvation accidents and where allowed human hunting feline immunodeficiency virus an endemic virus in cats is to the cougar social structure and home range like almost all cats the cougar is a mostly solitary animal only mothers and kittens live in groups with adults meeting rarely while generally loners cougars will reciprocally share kills with one another and seem to organize themselves into small communities defined by the territories of dominant males cats within these areas socialize more frequently with each other than with outsiders estimates of territory sizes for cougars vary greatly canadian geographic reports large male territories of to to sq mi with female ranges half that size other research suggests a much smaller lower limit of sq mi but an even greater upper limit of sq mi for males in the united states very large ranges have been reported in texas and the black hills of the northern great plains in excess of sq mi male ranges may include or overlap with those of females but at least where studied not with those of other males which reduces conflict between cougars ranges of females may overlap slightly with each other scrape marks urine and feces are used to mark territory and attract mates males may scrape together a small pile of leaves and grasses and then urinate on it as a way of marking territoryhome range sizes and overall cougar abundance depend on terrain vegetation and prey abundance one female adjacent to the san andres mountains was found with a large range of sq mi necessitated by poor prey abundance research has shown cougar abundances from animals to as much as in one study in south america per sq mi because males disperse farther than females and compete more directly for mates and territory they are more likely to be involved in conflict where a juvenile fails to leave his maternal range for example he may be killed by his father when males encounter each other they hiss spit and may engage in violent conflict if neither backs down hunting or relocation of the cougar may increase aggressive encounters by disrupting territories and bringing young transient animals into conflict with established individuals threats the cougar is threatened by habitat loss habitat fragmentation and depletion of its prey base due to poaching in florida it is threatened by heavy traffic which causes frequent fatal accidents involving cougars highways are a major barrier for dispersal of cougars conservation status the cougar is listed as least concern on the iucn red list since it is also listed on cites appendix ii hunting it is prohibited in california costa rica honduras nicaragua guatemala panama venezuela colombia french guiana suriname bolivia brazil chile paraguay uruguay and most of argentina establishing wildlife corridors and protecting sufficient range areas are critical for the sustainability of cougar populations research simulations showed that it faces a low extinction risk in areas which are larger than sq mi between one and four new individuals entering a population per decade markedly increases persistence thus highlighting the importance of habitat corridorsin the united states east of the mississippi river the only unequivocally known cougar population is the florida panther until the united states fish and wildlife service usfws recognized both an eastern cougar claimed to be a subspecies by some denied by others and the florida panther affording protection under the endangered species act in the documented count for the florida was individuals in march the usfws declared the eastern cougar extinct with the taxonomic uncertainty about its existence as a subspecies as well as the possibility of eastward migration of cougars from the western range the subject remains openthis uncertainty has been recognized by canadian authorities the canadian federal agency called committee on the status of endangered wildlife in canada rates its current data as insufficient to draw conclusions regarding the eastern cougar survival and its website says that despite many sightings in the past two decades from eastern canada there are insufficient data to evaluate the taxonomy or assign a status to this cougar notwithstanding numerous reported sightings in ontario quebec new brunswick and nova scotia it has been said that the evidence is inconclusive as there may not be a distinct subspecies and some sightings may be of escaped pets regulated cougar hunting is still common in the united states and canada although cougars are protected from all hunting in the yukon hunting is permitted in every us state except california from the rocky mountains to the pacific ocean the cougar can not be legally killed without a permit in california except under very specific circumstances such as when a cougar is in act of pursuing livestock or domestic animals or is declared a threat to public safetytexas is the only us state with a viable cougar population that is not protected in texas the cougar is considered as nuisance wildlife and any person holding a hunting or a trapping permit can kill a cougar regardless of the season number killed sex or age of the animal the organization balanced ecology inc launched the texas mountain lion conservation project in the project aims at raising awareness of local people about the status and ecological role of the cougar and mitigating conflict between landowners and cougars relationships with humans attacks on humans in north america the pertinent north american subspecies is p concolor couguar due to the expanding human population cougar ranges increasingly overlap with areas inhabited by humans attacks on humans are very rare as cougar prey recognition is a learned behavior and they do not generally recognize humans as prey in a study in new mexico of wild cougars who were not habituated to humans the animals did not exhibit threatening behavior to researchers who approached closely median m feet except in of cases of those were females with cubs attacks on people livestock and pets may occur when a puma habituates to humans or is in a condition of severe starvation attacks are most frequent during late spring and summer when juvenile cougars leave their mothers and search for new territorybetween and in north america there were reported confirmed attacks on humans resulting in nonfatal injuries and deaths of humans the total is greater than because some attacks had more than one victim by the count had climbed to attacks and deathswithin north america the distribution of attacks is not uniform the heavily populated state of california saw a dozen attacks to after just three from to including three fatalities washington state was the site of a fatal attack in its first since lightly populated new mexico reported an attack in the first there since with many predators a cougar may attack if cornered if a fleeing human stimulates their instinct to chase or if a person plays dead standing still may cause the cougar to consider a person easy prey exaggerating the threat to the animal through intense eye contact loud shouting and any other action to appear larger and more menacing may make the animal retreat fighting back with sticks and rocks or even bare hands is often effective in persuading an attacking cougar to disengagewhen cougars do attack they usually employ their characteristic neck bite attempting to position their teeth between the vertebrae and into the spinal cord neck head and spinal injuries are common and sometimes fatal children are at greatest risk of attack and least likely to survive an encounter detailed research into attacks prior to showed that of all victims and almost all fatalities were children the same study showed the highest proportion of attacks to have occurred in british columbia particularly on vancouver island where cougar populations are especially dense preceding attacks on humans cougars display aberrant behavior such as activity during daylight hours a lack of fear of humans and stalking humans there have sometimes been incidents of pet cougars mauling peopleresearch on new wildlife collars may be able to reduce conflicts by predicting when and where predatory animals hunt this may save the lives of humans pets and livestock as well as the lives of these large predatory mammals that are important to the balance of ecosystems in south america pumas in the southern cone of america often called argentine cougars by north americans are reputed to be extremely reluctant to attack man in legend they defended people against jaguars the nineteenth century naturalists felix de azara and william henry hudson thought that attacks on people even children or sleeping adults did not happen hudson citing anecdotal evidence from hunters claimed that pumas were positively inhibited from attacking people even in in fact attacks on humans although exceedingly rare have occurredan early authenticated case occurred near lake viedma patagonia in when a female mauled the argentine scientist francisco p moreno moreno afterwards showed the scars to theodore roosevelt in this instance however moreno had been wearing a poncho round his neck and head as protection against the cold in patagonia the guanaco is the puma chief prey animal another authenticated case occurred in in iguazu national park northeast argentina when the son of a ranger was killed by a female puma forensic analysis found specimens of the child hair and clothing fibers in the animal stomach in this area the coati is the puma chief prey despite prohibitory signs coatis are by tourists in the park causing unnatural approximation between cougars and humans this particular puma had been raised in captivity and released into the wild in a woman was found dead in a mountainous area in salta province in northwest argentina claw incisions which severed a jugular vein indicated that the attacker was a felid differential diagnosis ruled out other possible perpetrators there were no bite marks on the victim who had been herding goatsfatal attacks by other carnivores such as feral dogs can be misattributed to pumas without appropriate forensic knowledge livestock predation during the early years of ranching cougars were considered on par with wolves in destructiveness according to figures in texas in calves of texas million cattle and calves mohair goats mohair kids sheep of texas million sheep and lambs and lambs of texas million lambs were confirmed to have been killed by cougars that year in nevada in cougars were confirmed to have killed nine calves one horse four foals five goats sheep and lambs in both reports sheep were the most frequently attacked some instances of surplus killing have resulted in the deaths of sheep in one attack a cougar killing bite is applied to the back of the neck head or throat and the cat inflicts puncture marks with its claws usually seen on the sides and underside of the prey sometimes also shredding the prey as it holds on coyotes also typically bite the throat but the work of a cougar is generally clean while bites inflicted by coyotes and dogs leave ragged edges the size of the tooth puncture marks also helps distinguish kills made by cougars from those made by smaller predatorsremedial hunting appears to have the paradoxical effect of increased livestock predation and complaints of conflicts in a study the most important predictor of puma problems were remedial hunting of puma the previous year each additional puma on the landscape increased predation and complaints by but each additional animal killed on the landscape during the previous year increased complaints by the effect had a relationship with very heavy removal of adult puma remedial hunting leading to a increase in livestock and human conflicts this effect is attributed to the removal of older pumas that have learned to avoid people and their replacement by younger males that react differently to humans remedial hunting enables younger males to enter the former territories of the older animals predation on dogs predation by cougars on dogs is widespread but occurs at low frequencies in mythology the grace and power of the cougar have been widely admired in the cultures of the indigenous peoples of the americas the inca city of cusco is reported to have been designed in the shape of a cougar and the animal also gave its name to both inca regions and people the moche people represented the puma often in their ceramics the sky and thunder god of the inca viracocha has been associated with the animalin north america mythological descriptions of the cougar have appeared in the stories of the hocak language or winnebago of wisconsin and illinois and the cheyenne amongst others to the apache and walapai of arizona the wail of the cougar was a harbinger of death the algonquins and ojibwe believe that the cougar lived in the underworld and was wicked whereas it was a sacred animal among the cherokee in sports several sports teams currently or in the past have used the cougar as the mascot for their team although the name actually used has depended on the most popular regional name for the species in college sports teams brigham young university in utah and washington state university in the northwestern united states and the university of houston on the great plains of the united states use the cougar as their mascot on canada prairies mount royal university in calgary and the university of regina in saskatchewan use the cougar as their mascot in professional hockey the cougar was used by two teams and one northwestern team the chicago cougars of the world hockey association operated from while the red wings of the national hockey league were called the cougars from their inaugural season in until the detroit cougars were actually related to the victoria cougars of the western hockey league which had won the stanley cup in in that when the victoria cougars which had operated as the aristocrats from to and as the cougars from disbanded in the owners of the newly formed detroit club purchased the rights to many of the players of the victoria club and retained the cougar nickname the university of vermont also uses the mascot but uses the term catamount instead of cougar as was traditional in the region where the school is located the florida panthers of the national hockey league use the of the southeastern united states cougar subspecies the florida panther the state animal as its mascot the university of pittsburgh in western pennsylvania also uses the cougar as its sports mascot and for many other clubs and organizations but also uses the locally preferred name panther corresponding to nearby geographic features panther hollow and panther hollow lake which were named that by years before the university selected the name for its teams the university of pittsburgh campus has about physical representations of at different locations around the campus plus there are four such statues on the panther hollow bridge over panther hollow by contrast penn state university in central pennsylvania uses the nittany lion as its mascot nittany being the name of a nearby mountain and of the valley in which the university is located and lion being the abbreviated name of a stuffed mountain originally captioned as brush lion that was on display in a building at the university and which is today housed in the penn state museum the campus also has a nittany lion shrine featuring a large statue of a mountain lion on campus many high schools also use the cougar as their sports team mascot the sacramento mountain lions of the united football league used the california and southwestern united states regional name of the species the carolina panthers of the national football league have a black cat on their uniforms as opposed to a or cat so it is most often presumed to represent a black panther the black melanistic phase of either the jaguar which actually only lived in the far southwestern united states not the southeastern united states where carolina is located or the leopard of africa and asia a previously existing carolina sports team the carolina cougars who operated in the american basketball association from to actually used the cougar as its as opposed to the panther most sports team named the wildcats use a logo similar to a bobcat or in some cases in canada a lynx names which are often used for sports teams in their own right by contrast wildcat lager beer brewed by labatt has always shown a picture of a cougar on its label hybrids a pumapard is a hybrid animal
