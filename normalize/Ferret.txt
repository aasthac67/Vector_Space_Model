the ferret mustela putorius furo is the domesticated form of the european polecat a mammal belonging to the same genus as the weasel mustela in the family mustelidae their fur is typically brown black white or mixed they have an average length of cm in including a cm in tail weigh about between and kg and lb and have a natural lifespan of to years ferrets are sexually dimorphic predators with males being substantially larger than females the history of the ferret domestication is uncertain like that of most other domestic animals but it is likely that they have been domesticated for at least years they are still used for hunting rabbits in some parts of the world but increasingly they are kept only as pets being so closely related to polecats ferrets easily hybridize with them and this has occasionally resulted in feral colonies of hybrids that have caused damage to native fauna especially in new zealand as a result new zealand and some other parts of the world have imposed restrictions on the keeping of ferrets several other mustelids also have the word ferret in their common names including the ferret an endangered species etymology the name ferret is derived from the latin furittus meaning little thief a likely reference to the common ferret penchant for secreting away small itemsthe greek word iktis iktis latinized as ictis occurs in a play written by aristophanes the acharnians in bc whether this was a reference to ferrets polecats or the similar egyptian mongoose is uncertaina male ferret is called a hob a female ferret is a jill a spayed female is a sprite a neutered male is a gib and a vasectomised male is known as a hoblet ferrets under one year old are known as kits a group of ferrets is known as a business or historically as a busyness other purported collective nouns including besyness fesynes fesnyng and feamyng appear in some dictionaries but are almost certainly ghost words biology characteristics ferrets have a typical mustelid being long and slender their average length is about cm in including a cm in tail their pelage has various colorations including brown black white or mixed they weigh between and kg and lb and are sexually dimorphic as the males are substantially larger than females the average gestation period is days and females may have two or three litters each year the litter size is usually between three and seven kits which are weaned after three to six weeks and become independent at three months they become sexually mature at approximately six months and the average life span is seven to years ferrets are induced ovulators behavior ferrets spend hours a day asleep and are most active around the hours of dawn and dusk meaning they are crepuscular if they are caged they should be taken out daily to exercise and satisfy their curiosity they need at least an hour and a place to play unlike their polecat ancestors which are solitary animals most ferrets will live happily in social groups they are territorial like to burrow and prefer to sleep in an enclosed arealike many other mustelids ferrets have scent glands near their anus the secretions from which are used in scent marking ferrets can recognize individuals from these anal gland secretions as well as the sex of unfamiliar individuals ferrets may also use urine marking for sex and individual recognitionas with skunks ferrets can release their anal gland secretions when startled or scared but the smell is much less potent and dissipates rapidly most pet ferrets in the us are sold descented anal glands removed in many other parts of the world including the uk and other european countries is considered an unnecessary mutilation if excited they may perform a behavior called the weasel war dance characterized by frenzied sideways hops leaps and bumping into nearby objects despite its common name it is not aggressive but is a joyful invitation to play it is often accompanied by a unique soft clucking noise commonly referred to as dooking when scared ferrets will hiss when upset they squeak softly diet ferrets are obligate carnivores the natural diet of their wild ancestors consisted of whole small prey including meat organs bones skin feathers and fur ferrets have short digestive systems and quick metabolism so they need to eat frequently prepared dry foods consisting almost entirely of meat including cat food although specialized ferret food is increasingly available and preferable provide the most nutritional value and are the most convenient though some ferret owners feed or live prey such as mice and rabbits to their ferrets to more closely mimic their natural diet ferret digestive tracts lack a cecum and the animal is largely unable to digest plant matter before much was known about ferret physiology many breeders and pet stores recommended food like fruit in the ferret diet but it is now known that such foods are inappropriate and may in fact have negative ramifications on ferret health ferrets imprint on their food at around six months old this can make introducing new foods to an older ferret a challenge and even simply changing brands of kibble may meet with resistance from a ferret that has never eaten the food as a kit it is therefore advisable to expose young ferrets to as many different types and flavors of appropriate food as possible dentition ferrets have four types of teeth the number includes maxillary upper and mandibular lower teeth with a dental formula of twelve small incisor teeth only mm in long located between the canines in the front of the mouth these are used for grooming four canines used for killing prey twelve premolar teeth that the ferret uses to chew at the sides of the mouth directly behind the canines the ferret uses these teeth to cut through flesh using them in a scissors action to cut the meat into digestible chunks six molars two on top and four on the bottom at the far back of the mouth are used to crush food health ferrets are known to suffer from several distinct health problems among the most common are cancers affecting the adrenal glands pancreas and lymphatic system viral diseases include canine distemper and influenza health problems can occur in unspayed females when not being used for breeding certain health problems have also been linked to ferrets being neutered before reaching sexual maturity certain colors of ferret may also carry a genetic defect known as waardenburg syndrome similar to domestic cats ferrets can also suffer from hairballs and dental problems ferrets will also often chew on and swallow foreign objects which can lead to bowel obstruction history of domestication in common with most domestic animals the original reason for ferrets being domesticated by human beings is uncertain but it may have involved hunting according to phylogenetic studies the ferret was domesticated from the european polecat mustela putorius and likely descends from a north african lineage of the species analysis of mitochondrial dna suggests that ferrets were domesticated around years ago it has been claimed that the ancient egyptians were the first to domesticate ferrets but as no mummified remains of a ferret have yet been found nor any hieroglyph of a ferret and no polecat now occurs wild in the area that idea seems unlikelyferrets were probably used by the romans for huntingcolonies of feral ferrets have established themselves in areas where there is no competition from similarly sized predators such as in the shetland islands and in remote regions in new zealand where ferrets coexist with polecats hybridization is common it has been claimed that new zealand has the world largest feral population of hybrids in farmers in new zealand demanded that ferrets be introduced into the country to control the rabbit population which was also introduced by humans five ferrets were imported in and in shipments of ferrets were made from london totaling animals only landed and were sent from melbourne australia on the voyage the ferrets were mated with the european polecat creating a number of hybrids that were capable of surviving in the wild in and close to ferrets and ferret hybrids weasels and stoats were turned loose concern was raised that these animals would eventually prey on indigenous wildlife once rabbit populations dropped and this is exactly what happened to new zealand bird species which previously had had no mammalian predators ferreting for millennia the main use of ferrets was for hunting or ferreting with their long lean build and inquisitive nature ferrets are very well equipped for getting down holes and chasing rodents rabbits and moles out of their burrows caesar augustus sent ferrets or mongooses named viverrae by plinius to the balearic islands to control the rabbit plagues in bc in england in a law was enacted restricting the use of ferrets for hunting to the relatively wealthy it is ordained that no manner of layman which hath not lands to the value of forty shillings a year shall from henceforth keep any greyhound or other dog to hunt nor shall he use ferrets nets heys harepipes nor cords nor other engines for to take or destroy deer hares nor conies nor other gentlemen game under pain of twelve months imprisonment ferrets were first introduced into the new world in the century and were used extensively from until the start of world war ii to protect grain stores in the american west from rodents they are still used for hunting in some countries including the united kingdom where rabbits are considered a plague species by farmers the practice is illegal in several countries where it is feared that ferrets could unbalance the ecology in in finland where ferreting was previously unknown the city of helsinki began to use ferrets to restrict the city rabbit population to a manageable level ferreting was chosen because in populated areas it is considered to be safer and less ecologically damaging than shooting the rabbits as pets in the united states ferrets were relatively rare pets until the a government study by the california state bird and mammal conservation program estimated that by about domestic ferrets were being kept as pets in the united stateslike many household pets ferrets require a cage for ferrets a wire cage at least in mm long and deep and in mm wide or longer is needed ferrets can not be housed in environments such as an aquarium because of the poor ventilation it is preferable that the cage have more than one level but this is not crucial usually two to three different shelves are used regulation australia it is illegal to keep ferrets as pets in queensland or the northern territory in the australian capital territory a licence is required brazil they are allowed only if they are given a microchip identification tag and sterilized new zealand it has been illegal to sell distribute or breed ferrets in new zealand since unless certain conditions are met united states ferrets were once banned in many us states but most of these laws were rescinded in the and as they became popular pets ferrets are still illegal in california under fish and game code section and the california code of regulations although it is not illegal for veterinarians in the state to treat ferrets kept as pets additionally ferrets are strictly prohibited as pets under hawaii law because they are potential carriers of the rabies virus the territory of puerto rico has a similar law ferrets are restricted by individual cities such as washington dc and new york city which renewed its ban in they are also prohibited on many military bases a permit to own a ferret is needed in other areas including rhode island illinois and georgia do not require a permit to merely possess a ferret but a permit is required to breed ferrets it was once illegal to own ferrets in dallas texas but the current dallas city code for animals includes regulations for the vaccination of ferrets pet ferrets are legal in wisconsin however legality varies by municipality the city of oshkosh for example classifies ferrets as a wild animal and subsequently prohibits them from being kept within the city limits also an import permit from the state department of agriculture is required to bring one into the state under common law ferrets are deemed wild animals subject to strict liability for injuries they cause but in several states statutory law has overruled the common law deeming ferrets domestic japan in hokkaido prefecture ferrets must be registered with the local government in other prefectures no restrictions apply other uses ferrets are an important experimental animal model for human influenza and have been used to study the swine flu virus smith andrews laidlaw inoculated ferrets with human washes which produced a form of influenza that spread to other cage mates the human influenza virus influenza type a was transmitted from an infected ferret to a junior investigator from whom it was subsequently ferrets have been used in many broad areas of research such as the study of pathogenesis and treatment in a variety of human disease these including studies into cardiovascular disease nutrition respiratory diseases such as sars and human influenza airway physiology cystic fibrosis and gastrointestinal disease because they share many anatomical and physiological features with humans ferrets are extensively used as experimental subjects in biomedical research in fields such as virology reproductive physiology anatomy endocrinology and neuroscience in the uk ferret racing is often a feature of rural fairs or festivals with people placing small bets on ferrets that run set routes through pipes and wire mesh although financial bets are placed the event is primarily for entertainment purposes as opposed to betting sports such as horse or greyhound racing terminology and coloring most ferrets are either albinos with white fur and pink eyes or display the typical dark masked sable coloration of their wild polecat ancestors in recent years fancy breeders have produced a wide variety of colors and patterns color refers to the color of the ferret guard hairs undercoat eyes and nose pattern refers to the concentration and distribution of color on the body mask and nose as well as white markings on the head or feet when present some national organizations such as the american ferret association have attempted to classify these variations in their showing standardsthere are four basic colors the sable including chocolate and dark brown albino dark eyed white dew also known as black eyed white or bew and the silver all the other colors of a ferret are variations on one of these four categories coloring ferrets with a white stripe on their face or a fully white head primarily blazes badgers and pandas almost certainly carry a congenital defect which shares some similarities to waardenburg syndrome this causes among other things a cranial deformation in the womb which broadens the skull white face markings and also partial or total deafness it is estimated as many as percent of ferrets with these colorings are deaf white ferrets were favored in the middle ages for the ease in seeing them in thick undergrowth leonardo da vinci painting lady with an ermine is likely mislabelled the animal is probably a ferret not a stoat for which ermine is an alternative name for the animal in its white winter coat similarly the ermine portrait of queen elizabeth the first shows her with her pet ferret which has been decorated with heraldic ermine spots the ferreter tapestry is a tapestry from burgundy france now part of the burrell collection housed in the glasgow museum and art galleries it shows a group of peasants hunting rabbits with nets and white ferrets this image was reproduced in renaissance dress in italy by jacqueline herald bell hymangaston phoebus book of the hunt was written in approximately to explain how to hunt different kinds of animals including how to use ferrets to hunt rabbits illustrations show how multicolored ferrets that were fitted with muzzles were used to chase rabbits out of their warrens and into waiting nets import restrictions australia ferrets can not be imported into australia a report drafted in august seems to be the only effort made to date to change the situationcanada ferrets brought from anywhere except the us require a permit to import from the canadian food inspection agency animal health office ferrets from the us require only a vaccination certificate signed by a veterinarian ferrets under three months old are not subject to any import restrictionseuropean union as of july dogs cats and ferrets can travel freely within the european union under the pet passport scheme to cross a border within the eu ferrets require at minimum an eu pets passport and an identification microchip though some countries will accept a tattoo instead vaccinations are required most countries require a rabies vaccine and some require a distemper vaccine and treatment for ticks and fleas to hours before entry ferrets occasionally need to be quarantined before entering the country pets travel information is available from any eu veterinarian or on government websites united kingdom the uk accepts ferrets under the eu pets travel scheme ferrets must be microchipped vaccinated against rabies and documented they must be treated for ticks and tapeworms to hours before entry they must also arrive via an authorized route ferrets arriving from outside the eu may be subject to a quarantine see also references external links chisholm hugh ed ferret encyclopaedia britannica ed cambridge university press isaacsen adolph all about ferrets
