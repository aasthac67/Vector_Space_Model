the alpaca vicugna pacos is a species of south american camelid mammal it is similar to and often confused with the llama however alpacas are often noticeably smaller than llamas the two animals are closely related and can successfully both species are believed to have been domesticated from their wild relatives the vicuna and guanaco there are two breeds of alpaca the suri alpaca and the huacaya alpaca alpacas are kept in herds that graze on the level heights of the andes of southern peru western bolivia ecuador and northern chile at an altitude of to metres to feet above sea level alpacas are considerably smaller than llamas and unlike llamas they were not bred to be working animals but were bred specifically for their fiber alpaca fiber is used for making knitted and woven items similar to sheep wool these items include blankets sweaters hats gloves scarves a wide variety of textiles and ponchos in south america and sweaters socks coats and bedding in other parts of the world the fiber comes in more than natural colors as classified in peru as classified in australia and as classified in the united states alpacas communicate through body language the most common is spitting when they are in distress fearful or mean to show dominance male alpacas are more aggressive than females and tend to establish dominance of their herd group in some cases alpha males will immobilize the head and neck of a weaker or challenging male in order to show their strength and dominance in the textile industry alpaca primarily refers to the hair of peruvian alpacas but more broadly it refers to a style of fabric originally made from alpaca hair such as mohair icelandic sheep wool or even wool from other breeds of sheep in trade distinctions are made between alpacas and the several styles of mohair and lusteran adult alpaca generally is between and centimetres and inches in height at the shoulders withers they usually weigh between and kilograms and pounds background the relationship between alpacas and vicunas was disputed for many years in the and centuries the four south american lamoid species were assigned scientific names at that time the alpaca was assumed to be descended from the llama ignoring similarities in size fleece and dentition between the alpaca and the vicuna classification was complicated by the fact that all four species of south american camelid can interbreed and produce fertile offspring the advent of dna technology made a more accurate classification possible in the alpaca genus classification changed from lama pacos to vicugna pacos following the presentation of a paper on work by miranda kadwell et al on alpaca dna to the royal society showing the alpaca is descended from the vicuna not the guanaco origin and domestication alpacas were domesticated thousands of years ago the moche people of northern peru often used alpaca images in their art there are no known wild alpacas and its closest living relative the vicuna also native to south america is the wild ancestor of the alpaca the family camelidae first appeared in americas million years ago during the eocene period from the common ancestor protylopus the descendants divided into camelini and lamini tribes taking different migratory patterns to asia and south america respectively although the camelids became extinct in north america around million years ago it flourished in the south with the species we see today it was not until million years ago during the pliocene that the genus hemiauchenia of the tribe lamini split into palaeolama and lama the latter would then split again into lama and vicugna upon migrating down to south america remains of vicuna and guanaco have been found throughout peru for around years their domesticated counterparts the llama and alpacas have been found mummified in the moquegua valley in the south of peru dating back to years mummies found in this region show two breeds of alpacas more precise analysis of bone and teeth of these mummies has demonstrated that alpacas were domesticated from the vicugna vicugna other research considering the behavioral and morphological characteristics of alpacas and their wild counterparts seems to indicate that alpacas could find their origins in lama guanicoe as well as vicugna vicugna or even a hybrid of both genetic analysis shows a different picture of the origins of the alpaca analysis of mitochondrial dna shows that most alpacas have guanaco mtdna and many also have vicuna mtdna but microsatellite data shows that alpaca dna is much more similar to vicuna dna than to guanaco dna this suggests that alpacas are descendants of the vicugna vicugna not of the lama guanicoe the discrepancy with mtdna seems to be a result of the fact that mtdna is only transmitted by the mother and recent husbandry practices have caused hybridization between llamas which primarily carry guanaco dna and alpacas to the extent that many of today domestic alpacas are the result of male alpacas bred to female llamas this would explain the mtdna consistent with guanacos this situation has led to attempts to reclassify the alpaca as vicugna pacos breeds the alpaca comes in two breeds suri and huacaya based on their fibers rather than scientific or european classifications huacaya alpacas are the most commonly found constituting about of the population the huacaya alpaca is thought to have originated in peru this is due to their thicker fleece which makes them more suited to survive in the higher altitudes of the andes after being pushed into the highlands of peru after the arrival of the spanishsuri alpacas represent a smaller portion of the total alpaca population around they are thought to have been more prevalent in peru since they could be kept at a lower altitude where a thicker fleece was not needed for harsh weather conditions behavior alpacas are social herd animals that live in family groups consisting of a territorial alpha male females and their young ones alpacas warn the herd about intruders by making sharp noisy inhalations that sound like a bray the herd may attack smaller predators with their front feet and can spit and kick their aggression towards members of the canid family coyotes foxes dogs etc is exploited when alpacas are used as guard llamas for guarding sheepalpacas can sometimes be aggressive but they can also be very gentle intelligent and extremely observant for the most part alpacas are very quiet but male alpacas are more energetic when they get involved in fighting with other alpacas when they prey they are cautious but also nervous when they feel any type of threat they can feel threatened when a person or another alpaca comes up from behind themalpacas set their own boundaries of personal space within their families and groups they make a hierarchy in some sense and each alpaca is aware of the dominant animals in each group body language is the key to their communication it helps to maintain their order one example of their body communication includes a pose named broadside where their ears are pulled back and they stand sideways this pose is used when male alpacas are defending their territorywhen they are young they tend to follow larger objects and to sit near or under them an example of this is a baby alpaca with its mother this can also apply when an alpaca passes by an older alpaca training alpacas are often very trainable and will usually respond to reward most commonly in the form of food they are able to be petted without getting agitated although this is usually only when the animal is not being patted around the head or neck alpacas are usually quite easy to herd even in large groups although when being herded it is recommended that the handler approaches the animals slowly and quietly not doing this can result in danger for both the animals and the handleralpaca and llamas have started showing up in us nursing homes and hospitals as trained certified therapy animals the mayo clinic says therapy can reduce pain depression anxiety and fatigue this type of animal therapy is growing in popularity and there are several organizations throughout the united states that participate spitting not all alpacas spit but all are capable of doing so spit is somewhat euphemistic occasionally the projectile contains only air and a little saliva although alpacas commonly bring up acidic stomach contents generally a green grassy mix and project it onto their chosen targets spitting is mostly reserved for other alpacas but an alpaca will also occasionally spit at a human spitting can result in what is called sour mouth sour mouth is characterized by a lower lip and a gaping mouthalpacas can spit for several reasons a female alpaca spits when she is not interested in a male alpaca typically when she thinks that she is already impregnated both sexes of alpaca keep others away from their food or anything they have their eyes on most give a slight warning before spitting by blowing air out and raising their heads giving their ears a pinned appearancealpacas can spit up to ten feet if they need to for example if another animal does not back off the alpaca will throw up its stomach contents resulting in a lot of spitsome signs of stress which can lead to their spitting habits include humming a wrinkle under their eye drooling rapid breathing and stomping their feet when alpacas show any sign of interest or alertness they tend to sniff their surroundings watch closely or stand quietly in place and starewhen it comes to reproduction they spit because it is a response triggered by the progesterone levels being increased which is associated with ovulation hygiene alpacas use a communal dung pile where they do not graze this behaviour tends to limit the spread of internal parasites generally males have much tidier and fewer dung piles than females which tend to stand in a line and all go at once one female approaches the dung pile and begins to urinate defecate and the rest of the herd often follows alpaca waste is collected and used as garden fertilizer or even natural fertilizerbecause of their preference for using a dung pile some alpacas have been successfully develop dental hygiene problems which affect their eating and behavior warning signs include protracted chewing while eating or food spilling out of their mouths poor body condition and sunken cheeks are also telltales of dental problems sounds alpacas make a variety of sounds humming when alpacas are born the mother and baby hum constantly they also hum as a sign of distress especially when they are separated from their herd alpacas may also hum when curious happy worried or cautious snorting alpacas snort when another alpaca is invading its space grumbling alpacas grumble to warn each other for example when one is invading another personal space it sounds like gurgling clucking similar to a hen cluck alpacas cluck when a mother is concerned for her cria male alpacas cluck to signal friendly behavior screaming their screams are extremely deafening and loud they will scream when they are not handled correctly or when they are being attacked by a potential enemy screeching a cry presumably intended to terrify the opponent this sound is typically used by male alpacas when they are in a fight over dominance when a female screeches it is more of a growl when she is angry reproduction females are induced ovulators the act of mating and the presence of semen causes them to ovulate females usually conceive after just one breeding but occasionally do have trouble conceiving artificial insemination is technically difficult expensive and not common but it can be accomplished embryo transfer is more widespread a male is usually ready to mate for the first time between two and three years of age it is not advisable to allow a young female to be bred until she is mature and has reached of her mature weight a young female before conception is possibly a common cause of uterine infections as the age of maturation varies greatly between individuals it is usually recommended that novice breeders wait until females are months of age or older before initiating breedingalpacas can breed at any time but it is more difficult to breed in the winter most breed during autumn or late spring the most popular way to have alpacas mate is pen mating pen mating is when they move both the female and the desired male into a pen another way is paddock mating where one male alpaca is let loose in the paddock with several female alpacasthe gestation period is on an average months and usually results in a single offspring or cria twins are rare occurring about once per deliveries cria are generally between and pounds and are standing to minutes after birth after a female gives birth she is generally receptive to breeding again after about two weeks crias may be weaned through human intervention at about six months old and pounds but many breeders prefer to allow the female to decide when to wean her offspring they can be weaned earlier or later depending on their size and emotional maturity the average lifespan of an alpaca is between years and the alpaca on record is years habitat and lifestyle alpacas can be found all over south america they typically live in temperate conditions in the mountains with high altitudes they are easy to care for since they are not limited to a specific type of environment animals such as flamingos condors spectacled bears mountain lions coyotes llamas and sheep live near alpacas when they are in their natural habitat population alpacas are native to peru but can be found throughout the globe it currently has the largest population with over half the world animals the population declined drastically after the spanish conquistadors invaded the andes mountains in after which of the animals were destroyed the spanish also brought with them diseases that were fatal to alpacaseuropean conquest forced the animals to move higher into the mountains which remained there permanently although alpacas had almost been wiped out completely they were rediscovered sometime during the century by europeans after finding uses for them the animals became important to societies during the industrial revolution diet alpacas chew their food which ends up being mixed with their cud and saliva and then they swallow it alpacas usually eat of its body weight for normal growth they mainly need pasture grass hay or silage but some may also need supplemental energy and protein foods and they will also normally try to chew on almost anything eg empty bottle most alpaca ranchers rotate their feeding grounds so the grass can regrow and fecal parasites may die before reusing the area pasture grass is a great source of protein when seasons change the grass loses or gains more protein for example in the spring the pasture grass has about protein while in the summer it only has they need more energy supplements in the winter to produce body heat and warmth they get their fiber from hay or from long stems which provides them with vitamin e green grass contains vitamin a and e alpacas can eat natural unfertilized grass however ranchers can also supplement grass with grass hay to provide selenium and other necessary vitamins ranchers will feed their domestic alpacas a daily dose of grain to provide additional nutrients that are not fully obtained from their primary diet alpacas may obtain the necessary vitamins in their native grazing ranges digestion alpacas like other camelids have a stomach combined with chewing cud this system allows maximum extraction of nutrients from forages alpacas are not ruminants or modified ruminants as there are many differences between the anatomy and physiology of a camelid and a ruminant stomachalpacas will chew their food in a figure eight motion swallow the food and then pass it into one of the stomach chambers the first and second chambers called and are anaerobic fermentation chambers where the fermentation process begins the alpaca will further absorb nutrients and water in the first part of the third chamber the end of the third chamber called is where the stomach secretes acids to digest food and is the likely place where an alpaca will have ulcers if stressed poisonous plants many plants are poisonous to the alpaca including the bracken fern madagascar ragwort oleander and some azaleas in common with similar livestock others include acorns african rue agave amaryllis autumn crocus bear grass broom snakeweed buckwheat ragweed buttercups calla lily orange tree foliage carnations castor beans and many others fiber alpaca fleece is a lustrous and silky natural fiber while similar to sheep wool it is warmer not prickly and bears no lanolin which makes it hypoallergenic without lanolin it does not repel water it is also soft and luxurious in physical structure alpaca fiber is somewhat akin to hair being very glossy the preparing carding spinning weaving and finishing process of alpaca is very similar to the process used for wool alpaca fiber is also and meets the us consumer product safety commission standardsalpacas are typically sheared once per year in the spring each shearing produces approximately to kilograms to pounds of fiber per alpaca an adult alpaca might produce to kilograms to ounces of fiber as well as to kilograms to ounces of and fiber the quality of alpaca fiber is determined by how crimpy it is typically the greater the number of small folds in the fiber the greater the quality prices alpacas were the subject of a speculative bubble between their introduction to north america in and the early century the price for american alpacas ranged from us for a castrated male gelding to us for the highest in the world depending on breeding history sex and color in researchers warned that the higher prices sought for alpaca breeding stock were largely speculative and not supported by market fundamentals given the low inherent returns per head from the main end product alpaca fiber and prices into the per head rather than would be required for a commercially viable fiber production herdmarketed as the investment you can hug in television commercials by the alpaca owners and breeders association the market for alpacas was almost entirely dependent on breeding and selling animals to new buyers a classic sign of speculative bubbles in livestock the bubble burst in with the price of alpaca breeding stock dropping by thousands of dollars each year thereafter many farmers found themselves unable to sell animals for any price or even give them awayit is possible to raise up to alpacas per hectare alpacas per acre as they have a designated area for waste products and keep their eating area away from their waste area however this ratio differs from country to country and is highly dependent on the quality of pasture available in many desert locations it is generally only possible to run one to three animals per acre due to lack of suitable vegetation fiber quality is the primary variant in the price achieved for alpaca wool in australia it is common to classify the fiber by the thickness of the individual hairs and by the amount of vegetable matter contained in the supplied shearings livestock alpacas need to eat of body weight per day so about two kg lb bales of grass hay per month per animal when formulating a proper diet for alpacas water and hay analysis should be performed to determine the proper vitamin and mineral supplementation program two options are to provide free choice powder or feed a specially formulated ration indigenous to the highest regions of the andes this harsh environment has created an extremely hardy animal so only minimal housing and predator fencing are needed the alpaca stomachs allow for extremely efficient digestion there are no viable seeds in the manure because alpacas prefer to only eat tender plant leaves and will not consume thick plant stems therefore alpaca manure does not need composting to enrich pastures or ornamental landscaping nail and teeth trimming are needed every six to twelve months along with annual shearing similar to ruminants such as cattle and sheep alpacas have only lower teeth at the front of their mouths therefore they do not pull the grass up by the roots rotating pastures is still important though as alpacas have a tendency to regraze an area repeatedly alpacas are animals they do not need to be slaughtered to reap their product and their fiber is a renewable resource that grows yearly cultural presence alpacas are closely tied to cultural practices for andeans people prior to colonization the image of the alpaca was used in rituals and in their religious practices since the people in the region depended heavily on these animals for their sustenance the alpaca was seen as a gift from pachamama alpacas were used for their meat fibers for clothing and art and their images in the form of conopas conopas take their appearance from the suri alpacas with long locks flanking their sides and bangs covering the eyes and a depression on the back this depression is used in ritual practices usually filled with coca leaves and fat from alpacas and lamas to bring fertility and luck while their use was prevalent before colonization the attempts to convert the andean people to catholicism led to the acquisition of more than conopas in lima alone the origin of alpaca is depicted in legend the legend states they came to be in the world after a goddess fell in love with a man the goddess father only allowed her to be with her lover if he cared for her herd of alpacas on top of caring for the herd he was to always carry a small animal for his entire life as the goddess came into our world the alpacas followed her everything was fine until the man set the small animal down and the goddess fled back to her home on her way back home the man attempted to stop her and her herd from fleeing while he was not able to stop her from returning he was able to stop a few alpacas from returning these alpacas who did not make it back are said to be seen today in the swampy lands in the andes waiting for the end of the world so they may return to their goddess
