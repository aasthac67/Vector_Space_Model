geckos are small lizards belonging to the infraorder gekkota found in warm climates throughout the world they range from to cm to inches most geckos can not blink but they often lick their eyes to keep them clean and moist they have a fixed lens within each iris that enlarges in darkness to let in more light geckos are unique among lizards for their vocalizations which differs from species to species most geckos in the family gekkonidae use chirping or clicking sounds in their social interactions tokay geckos gekko gecko are known for their loud mating calls and some other species are capable of making hissing noises when alarmed or threatened they are the most group of lizards with about different species worldwide the new latin gekko and english gecko stem from the gekoq which is imitative of sounds that some species makeall geckos except species in the family eublepharidae lack eyelids instead the outer surface of the eyeball has a transparent membrane the cornea species without eyelids generally lick their own corneas when they need to clear them of dust and dirtnocturnal species have excellent night vision their color vision in low light is times more sensitive than human color vision the nocturnal geckos evolved from diurnal species which had lost the eye rods the gecko eye therefore modified its cones that increased in size into different types both single and double three different photopigments have been retained and are sensitive to uv blue and green they also use a multifocal optical system that allows them to generate a sharp image for at least two different depths while most gecko species are nocturnal some species are diurnal and active during the day which has evolved multiple times independently like most lizards geckos can lose their tails in defense a process called autotomy many species are well known for their specialised toe pads that enable them to climb smooth and vertical surfaces and even cross indoor ceilings with ease geckos are well known to people who live in warm regions of the world where several species make their home inside human habitations these for example the house gecko become part of the indoor menagerie and are often welcomed as they feed on insects including moths and mosquitoes unlike most lizards geckos are usually nocturnalthe largest species the kawekaweau is only known from a single stuffed specimen found in the basement of a museum in marseille france this gecko was cm in long and it was likely endemic to new zealand where it lived in native forests it was probably wiped out along with much of the native fauna of these islands in the late century when new invasive species such as rats and stoats were introduced to the country during european colonization the smallest gecko the jaragua sphaero is a mere cm about half an inch long and was discovered in on a small island off the coast of the dominican republic common traits like other reptiles geckos are ectothermic producing very little metabolic heat essentially a gecko body temperature is dependent on its environment also to accomplish their main as locomotion feeding reproduction must have a relatively elevated temperature shedding or molting all geckos shed their skin at fairly regular intervals with species differing in timing and method leopard geckos shed at about to intervals the presence of moisture aids in the shedding when shedding begins the gecko speeds the process by detaching the loose skin from its body and eating it for young geckos shedding occurs more frequently once a week but when they are fully grown they shed once every one to two months adhesion ability about of gecko species have adhesive toe pads that allow them to adhere to most surfaces without the use of liquids or surface tension such pads have been gained and lost repeatedly over the course of gecko evolution adhesive toepads evolved independently in about different gecko lineages and were lost in at least lineagesthe setae arranged in lamellae on gecko footpads enable attractive van der waals forces the weakest of the weak chemical forces between the structures and the surface these van der waals interactions involve no fluids in theory a boot made of synthetic setae would adhere as easily to the surface of the international space station as it would to a wall although adhesion varies with humiditya recent study suggests that gecko adhesion is in fact mainly determined by electrostatic interaction caused by contact electrification not van der waals or capillary forcesthe setae on the feet of geckos are also and usually remove any clogging dirt within a few stepsteflon which has very low surface energy is more difficult for geckos to adhere to than many other surfaces gecko adhesion is typically improved by higher humidity even on hydrophobic surfaces yet is reduced under conditions of complete immersion in water the role of water in that system is under discussion yet recent experiments agree that the presence of molecular water layers water molecules carry a very large dipole moment on the setae as well as on the surface increase the surface energy of both therefore the energy gain in getting these surfaces in contact is enlarged which results in an increased gecko adhesion force moreover the elastic properties of the change with water uptakegecko toes seem to be double jointed but this is a misnomer and is properly called digital hyperextension gecko toes can hyperextend in the opposite direction from human fingers and toes this allows them to overcome the van der waals force by peeling their toes off surfaces from the tips inward in essence by this peeling action the gecko separates spatula by spatula from the surface so for each spatula separation only some force necessary the process is similar to removing scotch tape from a surface geckos toes operate well below their full attractive capabilities most of the time because the margin for error is great depending upon the surface roughness and therefore the number of setae in contact with that surface use of small van der waals force requires very large surface areas every square millimeter of a gecko footpad contains about setae each seta has a diameter of mm human hair varies from to mm so the area of a human hair is equivalent to to setae each seta is in turn tipped with between and spatulae each spatula is mm long one of a meter or just below the wavelength of visible lightthe setae of a typical mature g oz gecko would be capable of supporting a weight of kg lb each spatula can exert an adhesive force of to nn the exact value of the adhesion force of a spatula varies with the surface energy of the substrate to which it adheres recent studies have moreover shown that the component of the surface energy derived from forces such as van der waals forces depends on the material structure below the outermost atomic layers up to nm beneath the surface taking that into account the adhesive strength can be inferred apart from the setae substances produced naturally in their come into play these lipids lubricate the setae and allow the gecko to detach its foot before the next step the origin of gecko adhesion likely started as simple modifications to the epidermis on the underside of the toes this was recently discovered in the genus gonatodes from south america simple elaborations of the epidermal spinules into setae have enabled gonatodes humeralis to climb smooth surfaces and sleep on smooth leaves biomimetic technologies designed to mimic gecko adhesion could produce reusable dry adhesives with many applications development effort is being put into these technologies but manufacturing synthetic setae is not a trivial material design task skin gecko skin does not generally bear scales but appears at a macro scale as a papillose surface which is made from protuberances developed across the entire body these confer superhydrophobicity and the unique design of the hair confers a profound antimicrobial action these protuberances are very small up to microns in length and tapering to a point gecko skin has been observed to have an property killing bacteria when it comes in contact with the skin teeth geckos are polyphyodonts and able to replace each of their teeth every to months next to the full grown tooth there is a small replacement tooth developing from the odontogenic stem cell in the dental lamina the formation of the teeth is pleurodont they are fused ankylosed by their sides to the inner surface of the jaw bones this formation is common in all species in the order squamata taxonomy and classification the infraorder gekkota is divided into seven families containing about genera of geckos including the legless pygopods family carphodactylidae family diplodactylidae family eublepharidae family gekkonidae family phyllodactylidae family pygopodidae family sphaerodactylidae species more than species of geckos
