the term antelope is used to refer to many species of ruminant indigenous to various regions in africa and eurasia antelopes comprise a wastebasket taxon miscellaneous group within the family bovidae encompassing all old world ruminants that are not bovines sheep or goats antelopes are considered the sister group to deer within the infraorder pecora a group of antelope is called a herdunlike deer antlers which are shed and grown annually antelope horns grow continuously etymology the english word antelope first appeared in and is derived from the old french antelop itself derived from medieval latin ant h alopus which in turn comes from the byzantine greek word antholops first attested in eustathius of antioch c according to whom it was a fabulous animal haunting the banks of the euphrates very savage hard to catch and having long horns capable of cutting down trees it perhaps derives from greek anthos flower and ops eye perhaps meaning beautiful eye or alluding to the animals long eyelashes this however may be a later folk etymology the word talopus and calopus from latin came to be used in heraldry in it was first used for living cervine animals species the antelope species most of which are native to africa occur in about genera the classification of tribes or subfamilies within bovidae is still a matter of debate with several alternative systems proposed antelope are not a cladistic or taxonomically defined group the term is used to describe all members of the family bovidae that do not fall under the category of sheep cattle or goats usually all species of the alcelaphinae antilopinae hippotraginae reduncinae cephalophinae many bovinae the grey rhebok and the impala are called antelopes distribution and habitat more species of antelope are native to africa than to any other continent almost exclusively in savannahs with species over much of east africa because savannah habitat in africa has expanded and contracted five times over the last three million years and the fossil record indicates this is when most extant species evolved it is believed that isolation in refugia during contractions was a major driver of this diversification other species occur in asia the arabian peninsula is home to the arabian oryx and dorcas gazelle india is home to the nilgai chinkara blackbuck tibetan antelope and antelope while russia and central asia have the tibetan antelope and saiga no antelope species is native to australasia or antarctica nor do any extant species occur in the americas though the nominate saiga subspecies occurred in north america during the pleistocene north america is currently home to the native pronghorn which taxonomists do not consider a member of the antelope group but which is often locally referred to as such eg american antelope in europe several extinct species occur in the fossil record and the saiga was found widely during the pleistocene but did not persist into the later holocene except in russian kalmykia and astrakhan oblastmany species of antelopes have been imported to other parts of the world especially the united states for exotic game hunting with some species possessing spectacular leaping and evasive skills individuals may escape texas in particular has many game ranches as well as habitats and climates that are very hospitable to african and asian plains antelope species accordingly wild populations of blackbuck antelope gemsbok and nilgai may be found in texasantelope live in a wide range of habitats numerically most live in the african savannahs however many species are more secluded such as the forest antelope as well as the extreme saiga the arabian oryx the rocky klipspringer and semiaquatic sitatungaspecies living in forests woodland or bush tend to be sedentary but many of the plains species undertake long migrations these enable species to follow the rains and thereby their food supply the gnus and gazelles of east africa perform some of the most impressive mass migratory circuits of all mammals morphology antelopes vary greatly in size for example a male common eland can measure cm ft in at the shoulder and weigh almost kg lb whereas an adult royal antelope may stand only cm in at the shoulder and weigh a mere kg lb not surprisingly for animals with long slender yet powerful legs many antelopes have long strides and can run fast some eg klipspringer are also adapted to inhabiting rock koppies and crags both dibatags and gerenuks habitually stand on their two hind legs to reach acacia and other tree foliage different antelope have different body types which can affect movement duikers are short antelope that can pick through dense foliage and dive into the shadows rapidly gazelle and springbok are known for their speed and leaping abilities even larger antelope such as nilgai elands and kudus are capable of jumping m ft in or greater although their running speed is restricted by their greater mass antelope have a wide variety of coverings though most have a dense coat of short fur in most species the coat pelage is some variation of a brown colour or several shades of brown often with white or pale underbodies exceptions include the zebra duiker the grey black and white jentink duiker and the black lechwe most of the antelopes have pale vertical stripes on their backs many desert and semidesert species are particularly pale some almost silvery or whitish eg arabian oryx the beisa and southern oryxes have gray and black pelages with vivid faces common features of various gazelles are white rumps which flash a warning to others when they run from danger and dark stripes midbody the latter feature is also shared by the springbok and beira the springbok also has a pouch of white brushlike hairs running along its back which opens up when the animal senses danger causing the dorsal hairs to stand on end antelope are ruminants so have molar teeth which grind cud food balls stored in the stomach into a pulp for further digestion they have no upper incisors but rather a hard upper gum pad against which their lower incisors bite to tear grass stems and leaves like many other herbivores antelopes rely on keen senses to avoid predators their eyes are placed on the sides of their heads giving them a broad radius of vision with minimal binocular vision their horizontally elongated pupils also help in this respect acute senses of smell and hearing give antelope the ability to perceive danger at night out in the open when predators are often on the prowl these same senses play an important role in contact between individuals of the same species markings on their heads ears legs and rumps are used in such communication many species flash such markings as well as their tails vocal communications include loud barks whistles moos and trumpeting many species also use scent marking to define their territories or simply to maintain contact with their relatives and neighbors many antelope are sexually dimorphic in most species both sexes have horns but those of males tend to be larger males tend to be larger than the females but exceptions in which the females tend to be heavier than the males include the bush duiker dwarf antelope cape grysbok and oribi all rather small species a number of species have hornless females eg sitatunga red lechwe and suni in some species the males and females have differently coloured pelages eg blackbuck and nyala the size and shape of antelope horns varies greatly those of the duikers and dwarf antelopes tend to be simple spikes but differ in the angle to the head from backward curved and backward pointing eg duiker to straight and upright eg steenbok other groups have twisted eg common eland spiral eg greater kudu recurved eg the reedbucks lyrate eg impala or long curved eg the oryxes horns horns are not shed and their bony cores are covered with a thick persistent sheath of horny material both of which distinguish them from antlershorns are efficient weapons and tend to be better developed in those species where males fight over females large herd antelope than in solitary or lekking species with competition for mates horns are clashed in combat males more commonly use their horns against each other than against another species the boss of the horns is typically arranged in such a way that two antelope striking at each other horns can not crack each other skulls making a fight via horn more ritualized than dangerous many species have ridges in their horns for at least the length of their horns but these ridges are not a direct indicator of age behavior mating strategies antelope are often classified by their reproductive behavior small antelope such as tend to be monogamous they live in a forest environment with patchy resources and a male is unable to monopolize more than one female due to this sparse distribution larger forest species often form very small herds of two to four females and one male some species such as lechwes pursue a lek breeding system where the males gather on a lekking ground and compete for a small territory while the females appraise males and choose one with which to mate large grazing antelope such as impala or wildebeest form large herds made up of many females and a single breeding male which excludes all other males often by combat defense antelope pursue a number of defense strategies often dictated by their morphology large antelope that gather in large herds such as wildebeest rely on numbers and running speed for protection in some species adults will encircle the offspring protecting them from predators when threatened many forest antelope rely on cryptic coloring and good hearing to avoid predators forest antelope often have very large ears and dark or striped colorations small antelope especially duikers evade predation by jumping into dense bush where the predator can not pursue springboks use a behavior known as stotting to confuse predators open grassland species have nowhere to hide from predators so they tend to be fast runners they are agile and have good are advantages when pursued by predators such as cheetahs which are the fastest of land animals but tire quickly reaction distances vary with predator species and behaviour for example gazelles may not flee from a lion until it is closer than m ft hunt as a pride or by surprise usually by stalking one that can be seen clearly is unlikely to attack however cheetahs will cause gazelles to flee at a range of over metres mile status about species are rated by the iucn as endangered such as the dama gazelle and mountain nyala a number of subspecies are also endangered including the giant sable antelope and the mhorr gazelle the main causes for concern for these species are habitat loss competition with cattle for grazing and trophy hunting the chiru or tibetan antelope is hunted for its pelt which is used in making shahtoosh wool used in shawls since the fur can only be removed from dead animals and each animal yields very little of the downy fur several antelope must be killed to make a single shawl this unsustainable demand has led to enormous declines in the chiru populationthe saiga is hunted for its horns which are considered an aphrodisiac by some cultures only the males have horns and have been so heavily hunted that some herds contain up to females to one male the species has shown a steep decline and is critically endangered lifespan it is difficult to determine how long antelope live in the wild with the preference of predators towards old and infirm individuals which can no longer sustain peak speeds few wild live as long as their biological potential in captivity wildebeest have lived beyond years old and impalas have reached their late teens humans culture the antelope horn is prized for supposed medicinal and magical powers in many places the horn of the male saiga in eastern practice is ground as an aphrodisiac for which it has been hunted nearly to extinction in the congo it is thought to confine spirits christian iconography sometimes uses the antelope two horns as a symbol of the two spiritual weapons christians possess the old testament and the new testament the antelope ability to run swiftly has also led to their association with the wind such as in the rig veda as the steeds of the maruts and the wind god vayu there is however no scientific evidence that the horns of any antelope have any change on a human physiology or characteristics in mali antelopes were believed to have brought the skills of agriculture to mankindhumans have also used the term antelope to refer to a tradition usually found in the sport of track and field domestication domestication of animals requires certain traits in the animal that antelope do not typically display most species are difficult to contain in any density due to the territoriality of the males or in the case of oryxes which have a relatively hierarchical social structure an aggressive disposition they can easily kill a human because many have extremely good jumping abilities providing adequate fencing is a challenge also antelope will consistently display a fear response to perceived predators such as humans making them very difficult to herd or handle although antelope have diets and rapid growth rates highly suitable for domestication this tendency to panic and their nonhierarchical social structure explains why antelope are uncommon ancient egyptians kept herds of gazelles and addax for meat and occasionally pets it is unknown whether they were truly domesticated but it seems unlikely as no domesticated gazelles exist today however humans have had success taming certain species such as the elands these antelope sometimes jump over each other backs when alarmed but this incongruous talent seems to be exploited only by wild members of the species tame elands do not take advantage of it and can be enclosed within a very low fence their meat milk and hides are all of excellent quality and experimental eland husbandry has been going on for some years in both ukraine and zimbabwe in both locations the animal has proved wholly amenable to domestication similarly european visitors to arabia reported tame gazelles are very common in the asiatic countries of which the species is a native and the poetry of these countries abounds in allusions both to the beauty and the gentleness of the gazelle other antelope that have been tamed successfully include the gemsbok the kudu and the springbok nor are the characteristics described above necessarily barriers to domestication for further information see animal domestication hybrid antelope a wide variety of antelope hybrids have been recorded in zoos game parks and wildlife ranches due to either a lack of more appropriate mates in enclosures shared with other species or a misidentification of species the ease of hybridization shows how closely related some antelope species are with few exceptions most hybrid antelope occur only in captivity most hybrids occur between species within the same genus all reported examples occur within the same subfamily as with most mammal hybrids the less closely related the parents the more likely the offspring will be sterile heraldry antelopes are a common symbol in heraldry though they occur in a highly distorted form from nature the heraldic antelope has the body of a stag and the tail of a lion with serrated horns and a small tusk at the end of its snout this bizarre and inaccurate form was invented by european heralds in the middle ages who knew little of foreign animals and made up the rest the antelope was mistakenly imagined to be a monstrous beast of prey the century poet edmund spenser referred to it as being as fierce and fell as a wolf antelopes can all also occur in their natural form in which case they are termed natural antelopes to distinguish them from the more usual heraldic antelope the arms previously used by the republic of south africa featured a natural antelope along with an oryx see also megafauna references external links microsoft
