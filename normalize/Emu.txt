the emu dromaius novaehollandiae is the living bird by height after its ratite relative the ostrich it is endemic to australia where it is the largest native bird and the only extant member of the genus dromaius the emu range covers most of mainland australia but the tasmanian kangaroo island and king island subspecies became extinct after the european settlement of australia in the bird is sufficiently common for it to be rated as a species by the international union for conservation of nature emus are brown flightless birds with long necks and legs and can reach up to metres ft in height emus can travel great distances and when necessary can sprint at mph they forage for a variety of plants and insects but have been known to go for weeks without eating they drink infrequently but take in copious amounts of water when the opportunity arises breeding takes place in may and june and fighting among females for a mate is common females can mate several times and lay several clutches of eggs in one season the male does the incubation during this process he hardly eats or drinks and loses a significant amount of weight the eggs hatch after around eight weeks and the young are nurtured by their fathers they reach full size after around six months but can remain as a family unit until the next breeding season the emu is an important cultural icon of australia appearing on the coat of arms and various coins the bird features prominently in indigenous australian mythology taxonomy history emus were first reported as having been seen by europeans when explorers visited the western coast of australia in this was during an expedition led by dutch captain willem de vlamingh who was searching for survivors of a ship that had gone missing two years earlier the birds were known on the eastern coast before when the first europeans settled there the birds were first mentioned under the name of the new holland cassowary in arthur phillip voyage to botany bay published in with the following description this is a species differing in many particulars from that generally known and is a much larger bird standing higher on its legs and having the neck longer than in the common one total length seven feet two inches the bill is not greatly different from that of the common cassowary but the horny appendage or helmet on top of the head in this species is totally wanting the whole of the head and neck is also covered with feathers except the throat and fore part of the neck about half way which are not so well feathered as the rest whereas in the common cassowary the head and neck are bare and carunculated as in the turkey the plumage in general consists of a mixture of brown and grey and the feathers are somewhat curled or bent at the ends in the natural state the wings are so very short as to be totally useless for flight and indeed are scarcely to be distinguished from the rest of the plumage were it not for their standing out a little the long spines which are seen in the wings of the common sort are in this not observable is there any appearance of a tail the legs are stout formed much as in the galeated cassowary with the addition of their being jagged or sawed the whole of their length at the back part the species was named by ornithologist john latham in based on a specimen from the sydney area of australia a country which was known as new holland at the time he collaborated on phillip book and provided the first descriptions of and names for many australian bird species dromaius comes from a greek word meaning racer and novaehollandiae is the latin term for new holland so the name can be rendered as new hollander in his original description of the emu the french ornithologist louis jean pierre vieillot used two generic names first dromiceius and later dromaius it has been a point of contention ever since as to which name should be used the latter is more correctly formed but the convention in taxonomy is that the first name given to an organism stands unless it is clearly a typographical error most modern publications including those of the australian government use dromaius with dromiceius mentioned as an alternative spelling systematics the emu was long classified with its closest relatives the cassowaries in the family casuariidae part of the ratite order struthioniformes however an alternate classification was proposed in by mitchell et al based on analysis of mitochondrial dna this splits off the casuariidae into their own order the casuariformes and includes only the cassowaries in the family casuariidae placing the emus in their own family dromaiidae the cladogram shown below is from their study two different dromaius species were present in australia at the time of european settlement and one additional species is known from fossil remains the insular dwarf emus d n baudinianus and d n minor originally present on kangaroo island and king island respectively both became extinct shortly after the arrival of europeans d n diemenensis another insular dwarf emu from tasmania became extinct around however the mainland subspecies d n novaehollandiae remains common the population of these birds varies from decade to decade largely being dependent on rainfall in it was estimated that there were between and birds emus were introduced to maria island off tasmania and kangaroo island off the coast of south australia during the century the maria island population died out in the the kangaroo island birds have successfully established a breeding populationin the australian ornithologist gregory m mathews recognised three living subspecies of emu d n novaehollandiae latham d n woodwardi mathews and d n rothschildi mathews however the handbook of the birds of the world argues that the last two of these subspecies are invalid natural variations in plumage colour and the nomadic nature of the species make it likely that there is a single race in mainland australia examination of the dna of the king island emu shows this bird to be closely related to the mainland emu and hence best treated as a subspecies common name the etymology of the common name emu is uncertain but is thought to have come from an arabic word for large bird that was later used by portuguese explorers to describe the related cassowary in australia and new guinea another theory is that it comes from the word ema which is used in portuguese to denote a large bird akin to an ostrich or crane in victoria some terms for the emu were barrimal in the dja dja wurrung language myoure in gunai and courn in jardwadjali the birds were known as murawung or birabayin to the local eora and darug inhabitants of the sydney basin description the emu is the second tallest bird in the world only being exceeded in height by the ostrich the largest individuals can reach up to to cm to in in height measured from the bill to the tail emus range in length from to cm to in with males averaging cm in and females averaging cm in emus are the fourth or fifth heaviest living bird after the two species of ostrich and two larger species of cassowary weighing slightly more on average than an emperor penguin adult emus weigh between and kg and lb with an average of and kg and lb in males and females respectively females are usually slightly larger than males and are substantially wider across the rump although flightless emus have vestigial wings the wing chord measuring around cm in and each wing having a small claw at the tip emus flap their wings when running perhaps as a means of stabilising themselves when moving fast they have long necks and legs and can run at speeds of mph due to their highly specialised pelvic limb musculature their feet have only three toes and a similarly reduced number of bones and associated foot muscles emus are unique among birds in that their gastrocnemius muscles in the back of the lower legs have four bellies instead of the usual three the pelvic limb muscles of emus contribute a similar proportion of the total body mass as do the flight muscles of flying birds when walking the emu takes strides of about cm ft but at full gallop a stride can be as long as cm ft its legs are devoid of feathers and underneath its feet are thick cushioned pads like the cassowary the emu has sharp claws on its toes which are its major defensive attribute and are used in combat to inflict wounds on opponents by kicking the toe and claw total cm in in length the bill is quite small measuring to cm to in and is soft being adapted for grazing emus have good eyesight and hearing which allows them to detect threats at some distance the neck of the emu is pale blue and shows through its sparse feathers they have plumage of shaggy appearance the shafts and the tips of the feathers are black solar radiation is absorbed by the tips and the inner plumage insulates the skin this prevents the birds from overheating allowing them to be active during the heat of the day a unique feature of the emu feather is the double rachis emerging from a single shaft both of the rachis have the same length and the texture is variable the area near the skin is rather furry but the more distant ends resemble grass the sexes are similar in appearance although the male penis can become visible when he urinates and defecates the plumage varies in colour due to environmental factors giving the bird a natural camouflage feathers of emus in more arid areas with red soils have a rufous tint while birds residing in damp conditions are generally darker in hue the juvenile plumage develops at about three months and is blackish finely barred with brown with the head and neck being especially dark the facial feathers gradually thin to expose the bluish skin the adult plumage has developed by about fifteen monthsthe eyes of an emu are protected by nictitating membranes these are translucent secondary eyelids that move horizontally from the inside edge of the eye to the outside edge they function as visors to protect the eyes from the dust that is prevalent in windy arid regions emus have a tracheal pouch which becomes more prominent during the mating season at more than cm in in length it is quite spacious it has a thin wall and an opening centimetres in long distribution and habitat once common on the east coast of australia emus are now uncommon there by contrast the development of agriculture and the provision of water for stock in the interior of the continent have increased the range of the emu in arid regions emus live in various habitats across australia both inland and near the coast they are most common in areas of savannah woodland and sclerophyll forest and least common in heavily populated districts and arid areas with annual precipitation of less than millimetres in emus predominately travel in pairs and while they can form large flocks this is an atypical social behaviour that arises from the common need to move towards a new food source emus have been shown to travel long distances to reach abundant feeding areas in western australia emu movements follow a distinct seasonal pattern north in summer and south in winter on the east coast their wanderings seem to be more random and do not appear to follow a set pattern behaviour and ecology emus are diurnal birds and spend their day foraging preening their plumage with their beak dust bathing and resting they are generally gregarious birds apart from the breeding season and while some forage others remain vigilant to their mutual benefit they are able to swim when necessary although they rarely do so unless the area is flooded or they need to cross a river emus begin to settle down at sunset and sleep during the night they do not sleep continuously but rouse themselves several times during the night when falling asleep emus first squat on their tarsi and enter a drowsy state during which they are alert enough to react to stimuli and quickly return to a fully awakened state if disturbed as they fall into deeper sleep their neck droops closer to the body and the eyelids begin to close if there are no disturbances they fall into a deeper sleep after about twenty minutes during this phase the body is gradually lowered until it is touching the ground with the legs folded underneath the beak is turned down so that the whole neck becomes and folded onto itself the feathers direct any rain downwards onto the ground it has been suggested that the sleeping position is a type of camouflage mimicking a small mound emus typically awake from deep sleep once every ninety minutes or so and stand upright to feed briefly or defecate this period of wakefulness lasts for ten to twenty minutes after which they return to slumber overall an emu sleeps for around seven hours in each period young emus usually sleep with their neck flat and stretched forward along the ground surface the vocalisations of emus mostly consist of various booming and grunting sounds the booming is created by the inflatable throat pouch the pitch can be regulated by the bird and depends on the size of the aperture most of the booming is done by females it is part of the courtship ritual is used to announce the holding of territory and is issued as a threat to rivals a boom is audible kilometres mi away while a low more resonant call produced during the breeding season may at first attract mates and peaks while the male is incubating the eggs most of the grunting is done by males it is used principally during the breeding season in territorial defence as a threat to other males during courtship and while the female is laying both sexes sometimes boom or grunt during threat displays or on encountering strange objectson very hot days emus pant to maintain their body temperature their lungs work as evaporative coolers and unlike some other species the resulting low levels of carbon dioxide in the blood do not appear to cause alkalosis for normal breathing in cooler weather they have large multifolded nasal passages cool air warms as it passes through into the lungs extracting heat from the nasal region on exhalation the emu cold nasal turbinates condense moisture back out of the air and absorb it for reuse as with other ratites the emu has great homeothermic ability and can maintain this status from to to the thermoneutral zone of emus lies between and and as with other ratites emus have a relatively low basal metabolic rate compared to other types of birds at the metabolic rate of an emu sitting down is about of that when standing partly because the lack of feathers under the stomach leads to a higher rate of heat loss when standing from the exposed underbelly diet emus forage in a diurnal pattern and eat a variety of native and introduced plant species the diet depends on seasonal availability with such plants as acacia casuarina and grasses being favoured they also eat insects and other arthropods including grasshoppers and crickets beetles cockroaches ladybirds bogong and moth larvae ants spiders and millipedes this provides a large part of their protein requirements in western australia food preferences have been observed in travelling emus they eat seeds from acacia aneura until the rains arrive after which they move on to fresh grass shoots and caterpillars in winter they feed on the leaves and pods of cassia and in spring they consume grasshoppers and the fruit of santalum acuminatum a sort of quandong they are also known to feed on wheat and any fruit or other crops that they can access easily climbing over high fences if necessary emus serve as an important agent for the dispersal of large viable seeds which contributes to floral biodiversity one undesirable effect of this occurred in queensland in the early twentieth century when emus fed on the fruit of prickly pears in the outback they defecated the seeds in various places as they moved around and this led to a series of campaigns to hunt emus and prevent the seeds of the invasive cactus being spread the cacti were eventually controlled by an introduced moth cactoblastis cactorum whose larvae fed on the plant one of the earliest examples of biological controlsmall stones are swallowed to assist in the grinding up and digestion of the plant material individual stones may weigh g oz and the birds may have as much as g lb in their gizzards at one time they also eat charcoal although the reason for this is unclear captive emus have been known to eat shards of glass marbles car keys jewellery and nuts and boltsemus drink infrequently but ingest large amounts when the opportunity arises they typically drink once a day first inspecting the water body and surrounding area in groups before kneeling down at the edge to drink they prefer being on firm ground while drinking rather than on rocks or mud but if they sense danger they often stand rather than kneel if not disturbed they may drink continuously for ten minutes due to the scarcity of water sources emus are sometimes forced to go without water for several days in the wild they often share water holes with kangaroos other birds and animals they are wary and tend to wait for the other animals to leave before drinking breeding emus form breeding pairs during the summer months of december and january and may remain together for about five months during this time they stay in an area a few kilometres in diameter and it is believed they find and defend territory within this area both males and females put on weight during the breeding season with the female becoming slightly heavier at between and kg and lb mating usually takes place between april and june the exact timing is determined by the climate as the birds nest during the coolest part of the year during the breeding season males experience hormonal changes including an increase in luteinising hormone and testosterone levels and their testicles double in sizemales construct a rough nest in a hollow on the ground using bark grass sticks and leaves to line it the nest is almost always a flat surface rather than a segment of a sphere although in cold conditions the nest is taller up to cm in tall and more spherical to provide some extra heat retention when other material is lacking the bird sometimes uses a spinifex tussock a metre or so across despite the prickly nature of the foliage the nest can be placed on open ground or near a shrub or rock the nest is usually placed in an area where the emu has a clear view of its surroundings and can detect approaching predatorsfemale emus court the males the female plumage darkens slightly and the small patches of bare featherless skin just below the eyes and near the beak turn the colour of the male plumage remains unchanged although the bare patches of skin also turn light blue when courting females stride around pulling their neck back while puffing out their feathers and emitting low monosyllabic calls that have been compared to drum beats this calling can occur when males are out of sight or more than metres ft away once the male attention has been gained the female circles her prospective mate at a distance of to metres to ft as she does this she looks at him by turning her neck while at the same time keeping her rump facing towards him if the male shows interest in the parading female he will move closer the female continues the courtship by shuffling further away but continuing to circle himif a male is interested he will stretch his neck and erect his feathers then bend over and peck at the ground he will circle around and sidle up to the female swaying his body and neck from side to side and rubbing his breast against his partner rump often the female will reject his advances with aggression but if amenable she signals acceptance by squatting down and raising her rump females are more aggressive than males during the courtship period often fighting for access to mates with fights among females accounting for more than half the aggressive interactions during this period if females court a male that already has a partner the incumbent female will try to repel the competitor usually by chasing and kicking these interactions can be prolonged lasting up to five hours especially when the male being fought over is single and neither female has the advantage of incumbency in these cases the females typically intensify their calls and displaysthe sperm from a mating is stored by the female and can suffice to fertilise about six eggs the pair mate every day or two and every second or third day the female lays one of a clutch of five to fifteen very large green eggs the shell is around mm in thick but rather thinner in northern regions according to indigenous australians the eggs are on average cm cm in in and weigh between and g and lb the maternal investment in the egg is considerable and the proportion of yolk to albumen at about is greater than would be predicted for a precocial egg of this size this probably relates to the long incubation period which means the developing chick must consume greater resources before hatching the first verified occurrence of genetically identical avian twins was demonstrated in the emu the egg surface is granulated and pale green during the incubation period the egg turns dark green although if the egg never hatches it will turn white from the bleaching effect of the sun the male becomes broody after his mate starts laying and may begin to incubate the eggs before the clutch is complete from this time on he does not eat drink or defecate and stands only to turn the eggs which he does about ten times a day he develops a brood patch a bare area of wrinkled skin which is in intimate contact with the eggs over the course of the incubation period he will lose a third of his weight and will survive on stored body fat and on any morning dew that he can reach from the nest as with many other australian birds such as the superb fairywren infidelity is the norm for emus despite the initial pair bond once the male starts brooding the female usually wanders off and may mate with other males and lay in multiple nests thus as many as half the chicks in a brood may not be fathered by the incubating male or even by either parent as emus also exhibit brood parasitism some females stay and defend the nest until the chicks start hatching but most leave the nesting area completely to nest again in a good season a female emu may nest three times if the parents stay together during the incubation period they will take turns standing guard over the eggs while the other drinks and feeds within earshot if it perceives a threat during this period it will lie down on top of the nest and try to blend in with the surrounds and suddenly stand up to confront and scare the other party if it comes closeincubation takes days and the male stops incubating the eggs shortly before they hatch the temperature of the nest rises slightly during the period although the eggs are laid sequentially they tend to hatch within two days of one another as the eggs that were laid later experienced higher temperatures and developed more rapidly during the process the precocial emu chicks need to develop a capacity for thermoregulation during incubation the embryos are kept at a constant temperature but the chicks will need to be able to cope with varying external temperatures by the time they hatchnewly hatched chicks are active and can leave the nest within a few days of hatching they stand about cm in tall at first weigh kg oz and have distinctive brown and cream stripes for camouflage which fade after three months or so the male guards the growing chicks for up to seven months teaching them how to find food chicks grow very quickly and are fully grown in five to six months they may remain with their family group for another six months or so before they split up to breed in their second season during their early life the young emus are defended by their father who adopts a belligerent stance towards other emus including the mother he does this by ruffling his feathers emitting sharp grunts and kicking his legs to drive off other animals he can also bend his knees to crouch over smaller chicks to protect them at night he envelops his young with his feathers as the young emus can not travel far the parents must choose an area with plentiful food in which to breed in captivity emus can live for upwards of ten years predation there are few native natural predators of emus still alive early in its species history it may have faced numerous terrestrial predators now extinct including the giant lizard megalania the thylacine and possibly other carnivorous marsupials which may explain their seemingly ability to defend themselves from terrestrial predators the main predator of emus today is the dingo which was originally introduced by aboriginals thousands of years ago from a stock of wolves dingoes try to kill the emu by attacking the head the emu typically tries to repel the dingo by jumping into the air and kicking or stamping the dingo on its way down the emu jumps as the dingo barely has the capacity to jump high enough to threaten its neck so a correctly timed leap to coincide with the dingo lunge can keep its head and neck out of dangerdespite the potential relationship the presence of predaceous dingoes does not appear to heavily influence emu numbers with other natural conditions just as likely to cause mortality eagles are the only avian predator capable of attacking emus though are perhaps most likely to take small or young specimens the eagles attack emus by swooping downwards rapidly and at high speed and aiming for the head and neck in this case the emu jumping technique as employed against the dingo is not useful the birds try to target the emu in open ground so that it can not hide behind obstacles under such circumstances the emu can only run in a chaotic manner and change directions frequently to try to evade its attacker other raptors monitor lizards introduced red foxes feral and domestic dogs and feral pigs occasionally feed on emu eggs or kill small chicks parasites emus can suffer from both external and internal parasites but under farmed conditions are more than ostriches or rheas external parasites include the louse dahlemhornia asymmetrica and various other lice ticks mites and flies chicks sometimes suffer from intestinal tract infections caused by coccidian protozoa and the nematode trichostrongylus tenuis infects the emu as well as a wide range of other birds causing haemorrhagic diarrhoea other nematodes are found in the trachea and bronchi syngamus trachea causing haemorrhagic tracheitis and cyathostoma variegatum causing serious respiratory problems in juveniles relationship with humans emus were used as a source of food by indigenous australians and early european settlers emus are inquisitive birds and have been known to approach humans if they see unexpected movement of a limb or piece of clothing in the wild they may follow and observe people aboriginal australians used a variety of techniques to catch the birds including spearing them while they drank at waterholes catching them in nets and attracting them by imitating their calls or by arousing their curiosity with a ball of feathers and rags dangled from a tree the pitchuri thornapple duboisia hopwoodii or some similar poisonous plant could be used to contaminate a waterhole after which the disoriented emus were easy to catch another stratagem was for the hunter to use a skin as a disguise and the birds could be lured into a camouflaged pit trap using rags or imitation calls aboriginal australians only killed emus out of necessity and frowned on anyone who hunted them for any other reason every part of the carcass had some use the fat was harvested for its valuable oil the bones were shaped into knives and tools the feathers were used for body adornment and the tendons substituted for stringthe early european settlers killed emus to provide food and used their fat for fuelling lamps they also tried to prevent them from interfering with farming or invading settlements in search of water during drought an extreme example of this was the emu war in western australia in emus flocked to the chandler and walgoolan area during a dry spell damaging rabbit fencing and devastating crops an attempt to drive them off was mounted with the army called in to dispatch them with machine guns the emus largely avoided the hunters and won the battle emus are large powerful birds and their legs are among the strongest of any animal and powerful enough to tear down metal fencing the birds are very defensive of their young and there have been two documented cases of humans being attacked by emus economic value in the areas in which it was endemic the emu was an important source of meat to aboriginal australians they used the fat as bush medicine and rubbed it into their skin it served as a valuable lubricant was used to oil wooden tools and utensils such as the coolamon and was mixed with ochre to make the traditional paint for ceremonial body adornment their eggs were also foraged for foodan example of how the emu was cooked comes from the arrernte of central australia who called it kere ankerre emus are around all the time in green times and dry times you pluck the feathers out first then pull out the crop from the stomach and put in the feathers you pulled out and then singe it on the fire you wrap the milk guts that you pulled out into something such as gum leaves and cook them when you got the fat off you cut the meat up and cook it on fire made from river red gum wood the birds were a food and fuel source for early european settlers and are now farmed in australia and elsewhere for their meat oil and leather commercial emu farming started in western australia around the commercial industry in the country is based on stock bred in captivity and all states except tasmania have licensing requirements to protect wild emus outside australia emus are farmed on a large scale in north america with about million birds in the us peru and china and to a lesser extent in some other countries emus breed well in captivity and are kept in large open pens to avoid the leg and digestive problems that arise from inactivity they are typically fed on grain supplemented by grazing and are slaughtered at to monthsthe salem district administration in india advised farmers in not to invest in the emu business which was being heavily promoted at the time further investigation was needed to assess the profitability of farming the birds in india in the united states it was reported in that many ranchers had left the emu business it was estimated that the number of growers had dropped from over five thousand in to one or two thousand in the remaining growers increasingly rely on sales of oil for their profit although leather eggs and meat are also sold emus are farmed primarily for their meat leather feathers and oil and of the carcass can be used emu meat is a product less than fat and is comparable to other lean meats most of the usable portions the best cuts come from the thigh and the larger muscles of the drum or lower leg are like other poultry dark meat emu meat is considered for cooking purposes by the us food and drug administration to be a red meat because its red colour and ph value approximate that of beef but for inspection purposes it is considered to be poultry emu fat is rendered to produce oil for cosmetics dietary supplements and therapeutic products the oil is obtained from the subcutaneous and retroperitoneal fat the macerated adipose tissue is heated and the liquefied fat is filtered to get a clear oil this consists mainly of fatty acids of which oleic acid linoleic and palmitic acids each are the most prominent components it also contains various notably carotenoids and flavonesthere is some evidence that the oil has properties however there have not yet been extensive tests and the usda regards pure emu oil as an unapproved drug and highlighted it in a article entitled how to spot health fraud nevertheless the oil has been linked to the easing of gastrointestinal inflammation and tests on rats have shown that it has a significant effect in treating arthritis and joint pain more so than olive or fish oils it has been scientifically shown to improve the rate of wound healing but the mechanism responsible for this effect is not understood a study has claimed that emu oil has a better and potential than ostrich oil and linked this to emu oil higher proportion of unsaturated to saturated fatty acids while there are no scientific studies showing that emu oil is effective in humans it is marketed and promoted as a dietary supplement with a wide variety of claimed health benefits commercially marketed emu oil supplements are poorly standardisedemu leather has a distinctive patterned surface due to a raised area around the feather follicles in the skin the leather is used in such items as wallets handbags shoes and clothes often in combination with other leathers the feathers and eggs are used in decorative arts and crafts in particular emptied emu eggs have been engraved with portraits similar to cameos and scenes of australian native animals mounted emu eggs and containers in the form of hundreds of goblets inkstands and vases were produced in the second half of the nineteenth century all richly embellished with images of australian flora fauna and indigenous people by travelling silversmiths founders of a australian grammar of ornament they continued longstanding traditions that can be traced back to the european mounted ostrich eggs of the thirteenth century and christian symbolism and notions of virginity fertility faith and strength for a society of proud settlers who sought to bring culture and civilisation to their new world the traditional goblet freed from its roots in a society dominated by court culture was creatively made novel in the australian colonies as forms and functions were invented to make the objects attractive to a new broader audience significant designers adolphus blau julius hogarth ernest leviny julius schomburgk johann heinrich steiner christian quist joachim matthias wendt william edwards and others had the technical training on which to build flourishing businesses in a country rich in raw materials and a clientele hungry for paraphernalia cultural references the emu has a prominent place in australian aboriginal mythology including a creation myth of the yuwaalaraay and other groups in new south wales who say that the sun was made by throwing an emu egg into the sky the bird features in numerous aetiological stories told across a number of aboriginal groups one story from western australia holds that a man once annoyed a small bird who responded by throwing a boomerang severing the arms of the man and transforming him into a flightless emu the kurdaitcha man of central australia is said to wear sandals made of emu feathers to mask his footprints many aboriginal language groups throughout australia have a tradition that the dark dust lanes in the milky way represent a giant emu in the sky several of the sydney rock engravings depict emus and the birds are mimicked in indigenous dancesthe emu is popularly but unofficially considered as a faunal emblem the national bird of australia it appears as a shield bearer on the coat of arms of australia with the red kangaroo and as a part of the arms also appears on the australian coin it has featured on numerous australian postage stamps including a new south wales anniversary issue from which featured a pence blue emu stamp a stamp released in and a stamp released in the hats of the australian light horse are decorated with emu feather plumestrademarks of early australian companies using the emu included webbenderfer bros frame mouldings mac robertson chocolate and cocoa dyason

australia with emu in their title including mountains lakes hills plains creeks and waterholes during the and centuries many australian companies and household products were named after the bird in western australia emu beer has been produced since the early century and the swan brewery continues to produce a range of beers branded as emu the quarterly journal of the royal australasian ornithologists union also known as birds australia is entitled emu austral ornithologythe comedian rod hull featured a wayward emu puppet in his act for many years and the bird returned to the small screen in the hands of his son after the puppeteer death in american insurance company liberty mutual launched an advertising campaign that features limu emu a emu status and conservation in john gould handbook to the birds of australia first published in he lamented the loss of the emu from tasmania where it had become rare and has since become extinct he noted that emus were no longer common in the vicinity of sydney and proposed that the species be given protected status in the emu killings in western australia peaked at and culls were also mounted in queensland during this period due to rampant crop damage in the bounties were still being paid in western australia for killing emus but since then wild emus have been granted formal protection under the environment protection and biodiversity conservation act their occurrence range is between and sq mi and a census suggested that their total population was between and their population trend is thought to be stable and the international union for the conservation of nature assesses their conservation status as being of least concern the isolated emu population of the new south wales north coast bioregion and port stephens is listed as endangered by the new south wales governmentalthough the population of emus on mainland australia is thought to be higher now than it was before european settlement some local populations are at risk of extinction the threats faced by emus include the clearance and fragmentation of areas of suitable habitat deliberate slaughter collisions with vehicles and predation of the
