bison are large ungulates in the genus bison within the subfamily bovinae two extant and six extinct species are recognised of the six extinct species five became extinct in the quaternary extinction event bison palaeosinensis evolved in the early pleistocene in south asia and was the evolutionary ancestor of b priscus steppe bison which was the ancestor of all other bison species from million years ago to bc steppe bison ranged across the mammoth steppe inhabiting europe and northern asia with b schoetensacki woodland bison and north america with b antiquus b latifrons and b occidentalis the last species to go extinct b occidentalis was succeeded at bc by b bison of the two surviving species the american bison b bison found only in north america is the more numerous although commonly known as a buffalo in the united states and canada it is only distantly related to the true buffalo the north american species is composed of two subspecies the plains bison b b bison and the wood bison b b athabascae which is the namesake of wood buffalo national park in canada a third subspecies the eastern bison b b pennsylvanicus is no longer considered a valid taxon being a junior synonym of b b bison references to woods bison or wood bison from the eastern united states confusingly refer to this subspecies not b b athabascae which was not found in the region the european bison b bonasus or wisent is found in europe and the caucasus reintroduced after being extinct in the wild while all bison species are classified in their own genus they are sometimes bred with domestic cattle genus bos and produce sometimes fertile offspring called beefalo or zubron description the american bison and the european bison wisent are the largest surviving terrestrial animals in north america and europe they are typical artiodactyl cloven hooved ungulates and are similar in appearance to other bovines such as cattle and true buffalo they are broad and muscular with shaggy coats of long hair adults grow up to metres feet inches in height and m ft in in length for american bison and up to m ft in in height and m ft in in length for european bison american bison can weigh from around to kilograms to pounds and european bison can weigh from to kg to lb european bison tend to be taller than american bison bison are nomadic grazers and travel in herds the bulls leave the herds of females at two or three years of age and join a herd of males which are generally smaller than female herds mature bulls rarely travel alone towards the end of the summer for the reproductive season the sexes necessarily commingleamerican bison are known for living in the great plains but formerly had a much larger range including much of the eastern united states and parts of mexico both species were hunted close to extinction during the and centuries but have since rebounded the wisent owing its survival in part to the chernobyl disaster as the chernobyl exclusion zone has become a kind of wildlife preserve for wisent and other rare megafauna such as the przewalski horse though poaching has become a threat in recent years the american plains bison is no longer listed as endangered but this does not mean the species is secure genetically pure b b bison currently number only about separated into fragmented of which require active conservation measures the wood bison is on the endangered species list in canada and is listed as threatened in the united states though numerous attempts have been made by beefalo ranchers to have it entirely removed from the endangered species list although superficially similar physical and behavioural differences exist between the american and european bison the american species has ribs while the european bison has the american bison has four lumbar vertebrae while the european has five the difference in this case is that what would be the first lumbar vertebra has ribs attached to it in american bison and is thus counted as the thoracic vertebra compared to thoracic vertebrae in wisent adult american bison are less slim in build and have shorter legs american bison tend to graze more and browse less than their european relatives their anatomies reflect this behavioural difference the american bison head hangs lower than the european the body of the american bison is typically hairier though its tail has less hair than that of the european bison the horns of the european bison point through the plane of their faces making them more adept at fighting through the interlocking of horns in the same manner as domestic cattle unlike the american bison which favours butting american bison are more easily tamed than their european cousins and breed with domestic cattle more readily evolution and genetic history the bovine tribe bovini split about to million years ago into the buffalos bubalus and syncerus and a group leading to bison and taurine cattle thereafter the family lineage of bison and taurine cattle does not appear to be a straightforward tree structure as is often depicted in much evolution because evidence of interbreeding and crossbreeding is seen between different species and members within this family even many millions of years after their ancestors separated into different species this crossbreeding was not sufficient to conflate the different species back together but it has resulted in unexpected relationships between many members of this group such as yak being related to american bison when such relationships would otherwise not be apparent a study of mitochondrial dna indicated four distinct maternal lineages in tribe bovini taurine cattle and zebu wisent american bison and yak and banteng gaur and gayalhowever y chromosome analysis associated wisent and american bison an earlier study using amplified fragment length polymorphism fingerprinting showed a close association of wisent with american bison and probably with the yak but noted that the interbreeding of bovini species made determining relationships problematicthe genus bison diverged from the lineage that led to cattle bos primigenius at the boundary in south asia two extant and six extinct species are recognised of the six extinct species five went extinct in the quaternary extinction event three were north american endemics bison antiquus b latifrons and b occidentalis the fourth b priscus steppe bison ranged across steppe environments from western europe through central asia east asia including japan and onto north america the fifth b schoetensacki woodland bison inhabited eurasian forests extending from western europe to the south of siberia the sixth b palaeosinensis evolving in the early pleistocene in south asia is presumed to have been the evolutionary ancestor of b priscus and all successive bison lineages the steppe bison b priscus evolved from bison palaeosinensis in the early pleistocene b priscus is seen clearly in the fossil record around million years ago the steppe bison spread across eurasia and all proceeding contemporary and successive species are believed to have derived from the steppe bison going extinct around bce in siberia and around bce in alaska outlasted only by b occidentalis b bonasus and b bison the steppe bison was the predominant bison pictured in the ancient cave paintings of spain and southern france the modern european bison is likely to have arisen from the steppe bison there is no direct fossil evidence of successive species between the steppe bison and the european bison though there are three possible lines of ancestry pertaining to the european wisent past research has suggested that the european bison is descended from bison that had migrated from asia to north america and then back to europe where they crossbred with existing steppe bison however more recent phylogenetic research points to an origin either from the phenotypically and genetically similar pleistocene woodland bison b schoetensacki or as the result of an interbreeding event between the steppe bison and the aurochs bos primigenius the ancestor of domesticated cattle around years ago the possible hybrid is referred to in vernacular as the bison as a to the discovery process of the higgs bosonat one point some steppe bison crossbred with the ancestors of the modern yak after that crossbreeding a population of steppe bison crossed the bering land bridge to north america the steppe bison spread through the northern parts of north america and lived in eurasia until around years ago and north america until to years agothe pleistocene woodland bison b schoetensacki evolved in the middle pleistocene from b priscus and tended to inhabit the dry conifer forests and woodland which lined the mammoth steppe occupying a range from western europe to the south of siberia although their fossil records are far rarer than their antecedent they are thought to have existed until at least bcebison latifrons the giant or longhorn bison is thought to have evolved in midcontinent north america from b priscus after the steppe bison crossed into north america giant bison b latifrons appeared in the fossil record about years ago b latifrons was one of many species of north american megafauna that became extinct during the transition from the pleistocene to the holocene epoch an event referred to as the quaternary extinction event it is thought to have disappeared some years ago during the late wisconsin glaciationb latifrons with the slightly smaller b antiquus for over years their predecessor the steppe bison appeared in the north american fossil record around years ago b latifrons is believed to have been a more species while b antiquus was a herding very much like its descendant b bison b antiquus gave rise to both b occidentalis and later b bison the modern american bison some to years ago b antiquus was the most common megafaunal species on the north american continent during much of the late pleistocene and is the most commonly found large animal found at the la brea tar pitsin dna extracted from bison priscus fossil remains beneath a volcanic ashfall in the yukon suggested recent arrival of the species that genetic material indicated that all american bison had a common ancestor to years ago during which period the bering land bridge was exposed this hypothesis precludes an earlier arrival the researchers sequenced mitochondrial genomes from both that specimen and from the remains of a recently discovered estimated giant b latifrons from snowmass colorado the genetic information also indicated that a second pleistocene migration of bison over the land bridge occurred to years ago during the population bottleneck after the great slaughter of american bison during the century the number of bison remaining alive in north america declined to as low as during that period a handful of ranchers gathered remnants of the existing herds to save the species from extinction these ranchers bred some of the bison with cattle in an effort to produce cattleo today called beefalo accidental crossings were also known to occur generally male domestic bulls were crossed with buffalo cows producing offspring of which only the females were fertile the crossbred animals did not demonstrate any form of hybrid vigor so the practice was abandoned bison hybrids were briefly experimented with in germany and found to be fully fertile and a herd of such animals is maintained in russia a herd of crossbreeds zubron is maintained in poland crosses do not occur naturally requiring caesarean delivery males are infertile the us national bison association has adopted a code of ethics that prohibits its members from deliberately crossbreeding bison with any other species in the united states many ranchers are now using dna testing to cull the residual cattle genetics from their bison herds the proportion of cattle dna that has been measured in introgressed individuals and bison herds today is typically quite low ranging from to there are also remnant purebred american bison herds on public lands in north america herds of importance are found in yellowstone national park wind cave national park in south dakota blue mounds state park in minnesota elk island national park in alberta and grasslands national park in saskatchewan in a purebred herd of individuals was identified on public lands in the henry mountains of southern utah via genetic testing of mitochondrial and nuclear dna this study published in also showed the henry mountains bison herd to be free of brucellosis a bacterial disease that was imported with domestic cattle to north america behavior wallowing is a common behavior of bison a bison wallow is a shallow depression in the soil either wet or dry bison roll in these depressions covering themselves with mud or dust possible explanations suggested for wallowing behavior include grooming behavior associated with moulting interaction typically rutting behavior social behavior for group cohesion play behavior relief from skin irritation due to biting insects reduction of ectoparasite load ticks and lice and thermoregulation in the process of wallowing bison may become infected by the fatal disease anthrax which may occur naturally in the soilbison temperament is often unpredictable they usually appear peaceful unconcerned even lazy yet they may attack anything often without warning or apparent reason they can move at speeds up to mph and cover long distances at a lumbering galloptheir most obvious weapons are the horns borne by both males and females but their massive heads can be used as battering rams effectively using the momentum produced by what is a typical weight of to kilograms to lb moving at mph the hind legs can also be used to kill or maim with devastating effect in the words of early naturalists they were dangerous savage animals that feared no other animal and in prime condition could best any foe except for wolves and brown bears the rutting or mating season lasts from june through september with peak activity in july and august at this time the older bulls rejoin the herd and fights often take place between bulls the herd exhibits much restlessness during breeding season the animals are belligerent unpredictable and most dangerous habitat american bison live in river valleys and on prairies and plains typical habitat is open or semiopen grasslands as well as sagebrush semiarid lands and scrublands some lightly wooded areas are also known historically to have supported bison they also graze in hilly or mountainous areas where the slopes are not steep though not particularly known as animals bison in the yellowstone park bison herd are frequently found at elevations above feet and the henry mountains bison herd is found on the plains around the henry mountains utah as well as in mountain valleys of the henry mountains to an altitude of feet european bison most commonly live in lightly wooded to fully wooded areas as well as areas with increased shrubs and bushes european bison can be found living on grasslands and plains as well but are not as common restrictions throughout most of their historical range landowners have sought restrictions on bison herds on private land are required to be fenced in in the state of montana bison on public lands may be shot due to concerns about transmission of disease to cattle and damage to public property in montana legislative measures concerning the bison were proposed and passed the legislature but opposed by native american tribes as they impinged on sovereign tribal rights three such bills were vetoed by steve bullock the governor of montana the bison circumstances remain an issue of contention between native american tribes and private landowners diet bison are ruminants which gives them the ability to ferment plants in a specialized stomach prior to digesting them bison were once thought to almost exclusively consume grasses and sedges but are now known to consume a of plants including woody plants and herbaceous eudicots over the course of the year bison shift which plants they select in their diet based on which plants have the highest protein or energy concentrations at a given time and will reliably consume the same species of plants across years protein concentrations of the plants they eat tend to be highest in the spring and decline thereafter reaching their lowest in the winter in yellowstone national park bison browsed willows and cottonwoods not only in the winter when few other plants are available but also in the summer bison are thought to migrate to optimize their diet and will concentrate their feeding on recently burned areas due to the higher quality forage the regrows after the burn wisent tend to browse on shrubs and trees more often than do the american bison which prefer grass to shrubbery and trees reproduction female bison typically do not reproduce until three years of age and can reproduce to at least years of age female bison can produce calves annually as long as their nutrition is sufficient but will not give birth to a calf after years where weight gain was too low a mother probability of reproduction the following year is strongly dependent on the mother mass and age heavier female bison produce heavier calves weighed in the fall at weaning than light mothers while the weight of calves is lower for older mothers after age predators owing to their size bison have few predators five notable exceptions are humans grey wolves cougars brown bears and coyotes the grey wolf generally takes down a bison while in a pack but cases of a single wolf killing bison have been reported brown bears also consume bison often by driving off the pack and consuming the wolves kill brown bears and coyotes also prey on bison calves historically and prehistorically lions tigers the dire wolf smilodon homotherium cave hyenas and homo sp had posed threats to bison infections and illness for the american bison the main cause of illness is malignant catarrhal fever though brucellosis is a serious concern in the yellowstone park bison herd bison in the antelope island bison herd are regularly inoculated against brucellosis parasites clostridium infection infectious bovine rhinotracheitis and bovine vibriosisthe major concerns for illness in european bison are disease and balanoposthitis which affects the male sex organs a number of parasitic diseases have also been cited as threats the inbreeding of the species caused by the small population plays a role in a number of genetic defects and immunity to diseases which in turn poses greater risks to the population name the term buffalo is sometimes considered to be a misnomer for this animal as it is only distantly related to either of the two true buffalo the asian water buffalo and the african buffalo samuel de champlain applied the term buffalo buffles in french to the bison in published after seeing skins and a drawing shown to him by members of the nipissing first nation who said they travelled days from east of lake huron to trade with another nation who hunted the animals though bison might be considered more scientifically correct as a result of standard usage buffalo is also considered correct and is listed in many dictionaries as an acceptable name for american buffalo or bison buffalo has a much longer history than bison which was first recorded in human impact bison was a significant resource for indigenous peoples of north america for food and raw materials until near extinction in the late century in fact for the indigenous peoples of the plains it was their principal food source native americans highly valued their relationship with the bison saw them as sacred and treated them in such a respectful way as to ensure their ongoing longevity and abundance in his biography lakota teacher and elder john fire lame deer describes the relationship as such the buffalo gave us everything we needed without it we were nothing our tipis were made of his skin his hide was our bed our blanket our winter coat it was our drum throbbing through the night alive holy out of his skin we made our water bags his flesh strengthened us became flesh of our flesh not the smallest part of it was wasted his stomach a stone dropped into it became our soup kettle his horns were our spoons the bones our knives our women awls and needles out of his sinews we made our bowstrings and thread his ribs were fashioned into sleds for our children his hoofs became rattles his mighty skull with the pipe leaning against it was our sacred altar the name of the greatest of all sioux was tatanka bull when you killed off the buffalo you also killed the real natural wild indian humans notably european settlers were almost exclusively accountable for the of the american bison in the at the beginning of the century tens of millions of bison roamed north america pioneers and settlers slaughtered an estimated million bison during the century although the causes of decline and the numbers killed are disputed and debated railroads were advertising hunting by rail where trains encountered large herds alongside or crossing the tracks men aboard fired from the train roof or windows leaving countless animals to rot where they died this overhunting was in part motivated by the us government desire to limit the range and power of indigenous plains indians whose diets and cultures depended on the buffalo herds the overhunting of the bison reduced their population to hundreds attempts to revive the american bison have been highly successful farming has increased their population to nearly the american bison is therefore no longer considered an endangered species however most of these animals are actually hybrids with domestic cattle and only two populations in yellowstone national park usa and elk island canada are genetically pure bisonas of july an estimated bison lived in yellowstone national park the largest us bison population on public land during visitors experienced injuries range so the park implemented education campaigns after years of success five injuries associated with bison encounters occurred in because visitors did not maintain the required distance of ft m from bison while hiking or taking pictures nutrition bison is an excellent source of complete protein and a rich source or more of the daily value dv of multiple vitamins including riboflavin niacin vitamin and vitamin and is also a rich source of minerals including iron phosphorus and zinc additionally bison is a good source or more of the dv of thiamine livestock the earliest plausible accounts of captive bison are those of the zoo at tenochtitlan the aztec capital which held an animal the spaniards called the mexican bull in francisco lopez de gomara described plains indians herding and leading bison like cattle in his controversial book historia general de las indias gomara having never visited the americas himself likely misinterpreted early ethnographic accounts as the more familiar pastoralist relationship of the old world today bison are increasingly raised for meat hides wool and dairy products the majority of bison in the world are raised for human consumption or fur clothing bison meat is generally considered to taste very similar to beef but is lower in fat and cholesterol yet higher in protein than beef which has led to the development of beefalo a fertile hybrid of bison and domestic cattle a market even exists for kosher bison meat these bison are slaughtered at one of the few kosher mammal slaughterhouses in the us and canada and the meat is then distributed worldwidein america the commercial industry for bison has been slow to develop despite individuals such as ted turner who have long marketed bison meat in the turner found limited success with restaurants for cuts of meat which include bison steaks and tenderloin cuts suitable for hamburger and hot dogs have been described as almost nonexistent this created a marketing problem for commercial farming because the majority of usable meat about pounds for each bison is suitable for these products in the united states department of agriculture purchased million worth of frozen overstock to save the industry which would later recover through better use of consumer marketing restaurants have played a role in popularizing bison meat like ted montana grill which added bison to their menus ruby tuesday first offered bison on their menus in canada commercial bison farming began in the concerning an unknown number of animals then the first census of the bison occurred in which recorded bison on farms and grew to bison on farms for the censusseveral pet food companies use bison as a red meat alternative in dog foods the companies producing these formulas include natural
