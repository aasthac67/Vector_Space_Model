the chamois rupicapra rupicapra is a species of native to mountains in europe from west to east including the cantabrian mountains the pyrenees the alps and the apennines the dinarides the tatra and the carpathian mountains the balkan mountains the rila rhodope massif pindus the northeastern mountains of turkey and the caucasus the chamois has also been introduced to the south island of new zealand some subspecies of chamois are strictly protected in the eu under the european habitats directive names the english name comes from french chamois the latter is derived from gaulish camox attested in latin century itself perhaps borrowing from some alpine language raetic ligurian the gaulish form also underlies german gemse gams gamse italian camoscio ladin ciamorz the usual pronunciation for the animal is uk or us approximating the french pronunciation Sa'mwa however when referring to chamois leather and in new zealand often for the animal itself it is and sometimes spelt shammy or chamy the plural of chamois is spelled the same as the singular and it may be pronounced with the final s sounded however as with many other quarry species the plural for the animal is often pronounced the same as the singular the dutch name for the chamois is gems and the male is called a gemsbok in afrikaans the name gemsbok came to refer to a species of subsaharan antelope of the genus oryx and this meaning of gemsbok has been adopted into english taxonomy the chamois along with sheep and goats are in the subfamily caprinae of the family bovidae there are two species of

occurs in the pyrenees r p parva cantabrian chamois occurs in the cantabrian mountains r p ornata abruzzo chamois occurs in the apennines description the chamois is a very small bovid a fully grown chamois reaches a height of cm in and measures cm in the tail is not generally visible except when mating males which weigh kg lb are slightly larger than females which weigh kg lb both males and females have short straightish horns which are hooked backwards near the tip the horn of the male being thicker in summer the fur has a rich brown colour which turns to a light grey in winter distinct characteristics are white contrasting marks on the sides of the head with pronounced black stripes below the eyes a white rump and a black stripe along the back biology and behaviour female chamois and their young live in herds of up to to individuals adult males tend to live solitarily for most of the year during the rut late december in europe may in new zealand males engage in fierce battles for the attention of unmated females an impregnated female undergoes a gestation period of days after which a single kid is usually born in may or early june on rare occasions twins may be born if a mother is killed other females in the herd may try to raise the young the kid is weaned at six months of age and is fully grown by one year of age however the kids do not reach sexual maturity until they are three to four years old although some females may mate at as early two years old at sexual maturity young males are forced out of their mother herds by dominant males who sometimes kill them and then wander somewhat nomadically until they can establish themselves as mature breeding specimens at eight to nine years of agechamois eat various types of vegetation including highland grasses and herbs during the summer and conifers barks and needles from trees in winter primarily diurnal in activity they often rest around and may actively forage during moonlit nightschamois can reach an age of years in captivity although the maximum recorded in the wild is from to years of age common causes of mortality can include avalanches epidemics and predation at present humans are the main predator of chamois in the past the principal predators were eurasian lynxes persian leopards and gray wolves with some predation possibly by brown bears and golden eagles chamois usually use speed and stealthy evasion to escape predators and can run at kilometers per hour mph and can jump m ft vertically into the air or over a distance of m ft distribution and habitat chamois are naturally distributed in the pyrenees the mountains of south and central europe turkey and the caucasus in asia they live at moderately high altitudes and are adapted to living in precipitous rugged rocky terrain they can be found at elevations up to at least m ft in europe chamois spend their summers above the tree line in meadows when winter rolls around they go to lower elevations of around m ft to live in forests mainly in areas dominated by pines in new zealand alpine chamois arrived in new zealand in as a gift from the austrian emperor franz joseph i in exchange for specimens of living ferns rare birds and lizards mr albert el bertling formerly head keeper of the zoological society gardens regents park london accepted an invitation from the new zealand government to deliver a consignment of chamois two bucks and six does to the colony they arrived in wellington new zealand on january on board the ss turakina from wellington the chamois were transhipped to the manaroa and conveyed to lyttelton then by rail to fairlie in south canterbury and a horse trek to mount cook the first surviving releases were made in the aoraki mount cook region and these animals gradually spread over much of the south islandin new zealand chamois hunting is unrestricted and even encouraged by the department of conservation to limit the animal impact on new zealand native alpine floranew zealand chamois tend to weigh about less than european individuals of the same age suggesting that food supplies may be limited hunting and wildlife management as their meat is considered tasty chamois are popular game animals chamois have two traits that are exploited by hunters the first is that they are most active in the morning and evening when they feed the second is that they tend to look for danger originating from below which means that a hunter stalking chamois from above is less likely to be observed and more likely to be successfulthe tuft of hair from the back of the neck the gamsbart chamois beard is traditionally worn as a decoration on hats throughout the alpine countries chamois leather chamois leather traditionally made from the hide of the chamois is very smooth and absorbent and is favoured in cleaning buffing and polishing because it produces no scratching modern chamois leather may be made from chamois hides but hides of deer or domestic goats or sheep are commonly used a fabric known as chamois is made variously from cotton flannel pva viscose and other materials with similar qualities it is napped to produce a plush surface similar to moleskin or chamois leather
