the wildebeest plural wildebeest or wildebeests also called the gnu new or noo is an antelope in the genus connochaetes it belongs to the family bovidae which includes antelopes cattle goats sheep and other horned ungulates connochaetes includes two species both native to africa the black wildebeest or gnu c gnou and the blue wildebeest or brindled gnu c taurinus fossil records suggest these two species diverged about one million years ago resulting in a northern and a southern species the blue wildebeest remained in its original range and changed very little from the ancestral species while the black wildebeest changed more as adaptation to its open grassland habitat in the south the most obvious way of telling the two species apart are the differences in their colouring and in the way their horns are orientedin east africa the blue wildebeest is the most abundant species some populations perform an annual migration to new grazing grounds but the black wildebeest is merely nomadic breeding in both takes place over a short period of time at the end of the rainy season and the calves are soon active and are able to move with the herd a fact necessary for their survival nevertheless some fall prey to large carnivores especially the spotted hyena wildebeest often graze in mixed herds with zebra which gives heightened awareness of potential predators they are also alert to the warning signals emitted by other animals such as baboons wildebeest are a tourist attraction but compete with domesticated livestock for pasture and are sometimes blamed by farmers for transferring diseases and parasites to their cattle some illegal hunting goes on but the population trend is fairly stable and some populations are in national parks or on private land the international union for conservation of nature lists both as species etymology wildebeest is dutch for wild beast or wild cattle in afrikaans bees cattle while connochaetes derives from the greek words konnos konnos beard and khaite khaite flowing hair mane some sources claim the name gnu originates from the khoikhoi name for these animals others contend the name and its pronunciation in english go back to the word nu used for the black wildebeest by the san people classification taxonomy and evolution the wildebeest genus connochaetes is placed under the family bovidae and subfamily alcelaphinae where its closest relatives are the hartebeest alcelaphus spp the hirola beatragus hunteri and species in the genus damaliscus such as the topi the tsessebe the blesbok and the bontebok the name connochaetes was given by german zoologist hinrich lichtenstein in settlers first discovered wildebeest in about on their way to the interior of south africa due to their resemblance to wild cattle these people called them wild ox or wildebeest the blue wildebeest was first known to westerners in the northern part of south africa a century later in the the early century one species of the wildebeest c albojubatus was identified in eastern africa in two separate races of the wildebeest were introduced namely gorgon a albojubatus athi wildebeest and g a mearnsi loita wildebeest however in the two were once again merged into a single race connochaetes taurinus albojubatus in the century two separate forms were recognised gorgon taurinus hecki and g t albojubatus finally two distinct types of wildebeest the blue and black wildebeest were identified the blue wildebeest was at first placed under a separate genus gorgon while the black wildebeest belonged to the genus connochaetes today they are united in the single genus connochaetes with the black wildebeest being named c gnou and the blue wildebeest c taurinus according to a mitochondrial dna analysis the black wildebeest are estimated to have diverged from the main lineage during the middle pleistocene and became a distinct species around a million years ago a divergence rate around has been calculated the split does not seem to have been driven by competition for resources but instead because each species adopted a different ecological niche and occupied a different trophic levelblue wildebeest fossils dating back some million years ago are common and widespread they have been found in the caves at the cradle of humankind north of johannesburg elsewhere in south africa they are plentiful at such sites as elandsfontein cornelia and florisbad the earliest fossils of the black wildebeest were found in sedimentary rock in cornelia in the orange free state and dated back about years today five subspecies of the blue wildebeest are recognised while the black wildebeest has no named subspecies genetics and hybrids the diploid number of chromosomes in the wildebeest is chromosomes were studied in a male and a female wildebeest in the female all except a pair of very large submetacentric chromosomes were found to be acrocentric metaphases were studied in the male chromosomes and very large submetacentric chromosomes were found there as well similar to those in the female both in size and morphology other chromosomes were acrocentric the x chromosome is a large acrocentric and the y chromosome a minute onethe two species of the wildebeest are known to hybridise male black wildebeest have been reported to mate with female blue wildebeest and vice versa the differences in social behaviour and habitats have historically prevented interspecific hybridisation between the species but hybridisation may occur when they are both confined within the same area the resulting offspring are usually fertile a study of these hybrid animals at spioenkop dam nature reserve in south africa revealed that many had disadvantageous abnormalities relating to their teeth horns and the wormian bones in the skull another study reported an increase in the size of the hybrid as compared to either of its parents in some animals the tympanic part of the temporal bone is highly deformed and in others the radius and ulna are fused characteristics of the species both species of wildebeest are horned ungulates resembling cattle males are larger than females and both have heavy forequarters compared to their hindquarters they have broad muzzles roman noses and shaggy manes and tails the most striking morphological differences between the black and blue wildebeest are the orientation and curvature of their horns and the colour of their coats the blue wildebeest is the bigger of the two species in males blue wildebeest stand cm tall at the shoulder and weigh around kg while the black wildebeest stands to cm tall and weighs about kg in females blue wildebeest have a shoulder height of cm and weigh kg while black wildebeest females stand cm at the shoulder and weigh kg the horns of blue wildebeest protrude to the side then curve downwards before curving up back towards the skull while the horns of the black wildebeest curve forward then downward before curving upwards at the tips blue wildebeest tend to be a dark grey colour with stripes but may have a bluish sheen the black wildebeest has hair with a mane that ranges in colour from cream to black and a tail the blue wildebeest lives in a wide variety of habitats including woodlands and grasslands while the black wildebeest tends to reside exclusively in open grassland areas in some areas the blue wildebeest migrates over long distances in the winter whereas the black wildebeest does not the milk of the female black wildebeest contains a higher protein lower fat and lower lactose content than the milk of the blue wildebeest wildebeest can live more than years though their average lifespan is around years distribution and habitat wildebeest inhabit the plains and open woodlands of parts of africa south of the sahara the black wildebeest is native to the southernmost parts of the continent its historical range included south africa eswatini and lesotho but in the latter two countries it was hunted to extinction in the century it has now been reintroduced to them and also introduced to namibia where it has become well established it inhabits open plains grasslands and karoo shrublands in both steep mountainous regions and lower undulating hills at altitudes varying between and m and ft in the past it inhabited the highveld temperate grasslands during the dry winter season and the arid karoo region during the rains however as a result of widespread hunting the black wildebeest no longer occupies its historical range or makes migrations and is now largely limited to game farms and protected reservesthe blue wildebeest is native to eastern and southern africa its range includes kenya tanzania botswana zambia zimbabwe mozambique south africa swaziland and angola it is no longer found in malawi but has been successfully reintroduced into namibia blue wildebeest are mainly found in short grass plains bordering acacia savannas thriving in areas that are neither too wet nor too dry they can be found in habitats that vary from overgrazed areas with dense bush to open woodland floodplains in east africa the blue wildebeest is the most abundant big game species both in population and biomass it is a notable feature of the serengeti national park in tanzania the maasai mara national reserve in kenya and the liuwa plain national park in zambia migration not all wildebeest are migratory black wildebeest herds are often nomadic or may have a regular home range of sq mi bulls may occupy territories usually about to m to ft apart but this spacing varies according to the quality of the habitat in favourable conditions they may be as close as m ft or they may be as far apart as m ft in poor habitat female herds have home ranges of about acres ha sq mi in size herds of nonterritorial bachelor males roam at will and do not seem to have any restrictions on where they wanderblue wildebeest have both migratory and sedentary populations in the ngorongoro most animals are sedentary and males maintain a network of territories throughout the year though breeding is seasonal in nature females and young form groups of about individuals or join together in larger aggregations and nonterritorial males form bachelor groups in the serengeti and tarangire ecosystems populations are mostly migratory with herds consisting of both sexes frequently moving but resident subpopulations also exist during the rutting season the males may form temporary territories for a few hours or a day or so and attempt to gather together a few females with which to mate but soon they have to move on often moving ahead to set up another temporary territoryin the maasai mara game reserve a population of blue wildebeest had dwindled from about animals in to about in the reason for the decline is thought to be the increasing competition between cattle and wildebeest for a diminishing area of grazing land as a result of changes in agricultural practices and possibly fluctuations in rainfalleach year some east african populations of blue wildebeest have a migration seemingly timed to coincide with the annual pattern of rainfall and grass growth the timing of their migrations in both the rainy and dry seasons can vary considerably by months from year to year at the end of the wet season may or june in east africa wildebeest migrate to areas in response to a lack of surface drinking water when the rainy season begins again months later animals quickly move back to their ranges factors suspected to affect migration include food abundance surface water availability predators and phosphorus content in grasses phosphorus is a crucial element for all life forms particularly for lactating female bovids as a result during the rainy season wildebeest select grazing areas that contain particularly high phosphorus levels one study found in addition to phosphorus wildebeest select ranges containing grass with relatively high nitrogen contentaerial photography has revealed that a level of organisation occurs in the movement of the herd that can not be apparent to each individual animal for example the migratory herd exhibits a wavy front and this suggests that some degree of local is taking place numerous documentaries feature wildebeest crossing rivers with many being eaten by crocodiles or drowning in the attempt while having the appearance of a frenzy recent research has shown a herd of wildebeest possesses what is known as a swarm intelligence whereby the animals systematically explore and overcome the obstacle as one ecology predators major predators that feed on wildebeest include the lion hyena african wild dog cheetah leopard and crocodile which seem to favour the wildebeest over other prey wildebeest however are very strong and can inflict considerable injury even to a lion wildebeest have a maximum running speed of around mph the primary defensive tactic is herding where the young animals are protected by the older larger ones while the herd runs as a group typically the predators attempt to isolate a young or ill animal and attack without having to worry about the herd wildebeest have developed additional sophisticated cooperative behaviours such as animals taking turns sleeping while others stand guard against a night attack by invading predators wildebeest migrations are closely followed by vultures as wildebeest carcasses are an important source of food for these scavengers the vultures consume about of the wildebeest carcasses available decreases in the number of migrating wildebeest have also had a negative effect on the vultures in the serengeti ecosystem tanzania wildebeest may help facilitate the migration of other grazers such as thomson gazelles eudorcas thomsonii which eat the grasses stimulated by wildebeest foraging interactions with nonpredators zebras and wildebeest group together in open savannah environments with high chances of predation this grouping strategy reduces predation risk because larger groups decrease each individual chance of being hunted and predators are more easily seen in open areas the seasonal presence of thousands of migratory wildebeests reduces local lion predation on giraffe calves resulting in greater survival of giraffeswildebeest can also listen in on the alarm calls of other species and by doing so can reduce their risk of predation one study showed along with other ungulates wildebeests responded more strongly to the baboon alarm calls compared to the baboon contest calls though both types of calls had similar patterns amplitudes and durations the alarm calls were a response of the baboons to lions and the contest calls were recorded when a dispute between two males occurred breeding and reproduction wildebeest do not form permanent pair bonds and during the mating season or rut the males establish temporary territories and try to attract females into them these small territories are about square metres sq ft acres with up to territories per square kilometre sq mi acres the males defend these territories from other males while competing for females that are coming into oestrus the males use grunts and distinctive behaviour to entice females into their territories wildebeest usually breed at the end of the rainy season when the animals are well fed and at their peak of fitness this usually occurs between may and july and birthing usually takes place between january and march at the start of the wet season wildebeest females breed seasonally and ovulate spontaneouslythe estrous cycle is about days and the gestation period lasts to days the calves weigh about kg lb at birth and scramble to their feet within minutes being able to move with the herd soon afterwards a fact on which their survival relies the main predator of the calves is the spotted hyena the calving peak period lasts for weeks and in small subpopulations and isolated groups mortality of calves may be as high as however in larger aggregations or small groups living near large herds survival rates may be over groups of wildebeest females and young live in the small areas established by the male when groups of wildebeest join together the female to male ratio is higher because the females choose to move to the areas held by a smaller number of males this sex ratio may be due to illegal hunting and human disturbance with higher male mortality having been attributed to hunting threats and conservation today many wildebeest populations are experiencing rapid declines overland migration as a biological process requires large connected landscapes which are increasingly difficult to maintain particularly over the long term when human demands on the landscape compete the most acute threat comes from migration barriers such as fences and roads in one of the more striking examples of the consequences of on terrestrial migrations botswanan authorities placed thousands of kilometres of fences across the kalahari that prevented wildebeests from reaching watering holes and grazing grounds resulting in the deaths of tens of thousands of individuals reducing the wildebeest population to less than of its previous size illegal hunting is a major conservation concern in many areas along with natural threats posed by main predators which include lions leopards african hunting dogs cheetahs and hyenas where the black and blue wildebeest share a common range the two can hybridise and this is regarded as a potential threat to the black wildebeestthe black wildebeest has been classified as a species by the international union for conservation of nature in the iucn red list the populations of this species are on an increase now more than individuals are believed to remain of which are in namibia outside their natural range and where it is farmed around of the wildebeest occurs in private areas while the other is confined in protected areas its introduction into namibia has been a success and numbers have increased substantially there from in to in the blue wildebeest has also been rated as of least concern the population trend is stable and their numbers are estimated to be around mainly due to the increase of the populations in serengeti national park tanzania to however the numbers of one of the subspecies the eastern wildebeest c t albojubatus have seen a steep decline population density ranges from in hwange and etosha national parks to in ngorongoro conservation area and serengeti national park uses and interaction with humans wildebeest provide several useful animal products the hide makes leather and the flesh is coarse dry and rather hard wildebeest are killed for food especially to make biltong in southern africa this dried game meat is a delicacy and an important food item in africa the meat of females is more tender than that of males and is the most tender during the autumn season wildebeest are a regular target for illegal meat hunters because their numbers make them easy to find cooks preparing the wildebeest carcass usually cut it into pieces the estimated price for wildebeest meat was about us per kilogram lb around the silky flowing tail of the black wildebeest is used to make or chowrieswildebeest benefit the ecosystem by increasing soil fertility with their excreta they are economically important for human beings as they are a major tourist attraction they also provide important products such as leather to humans wildebeest however can also have a negative impact on humans wild individuals can be competitors of commercial livestock and can transmit diseases and cause epidemics among animals particularly domestic cattle they can also spread ticks lungworms tapeworms flies and paramphistome flukes cultural depictions the wildebeest is depicted on the coat of arms of the province of natal and later in south africa over the years the south african authorities have issued several stamps displaying the animal and the south african mint has struck a two cent piece with a prancing black wildebeestmovies and television shows also feature wildebeests including khumba mama v the wild kazar and his minions all hail king julien vigman wildebeest phineas and ferb newton the gnu the great space coaster newscaster gary gnu and the lion king the wildebeest stampede that resulted in mufasa death michael flanders wrote a humorous song called the gnu which was very popular when he performed it with donald swann in a revue called at the drop of a hat which opened in london on december in the british tea brand typhoo ran a series of television advertisements featuring an animated anthropomorphic gnu character the wildebeest is the mascot of the gnu project and gnu operating system in the llama llama series by anna dewdney an anthropomorphised wildebeest named nelly gnu is the main character llama llama best friend and is also featured in a title of her own nelly gnu and daddy too
