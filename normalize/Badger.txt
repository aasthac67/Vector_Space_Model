badgers are omnivores in the families mustelidae which also includes the otters polecats weasels and ferrets and mephitidae which also includes the skunks badgers are a polyphyletic grouping and are not a natural taxonomic grouping badgers are united by their squat bodies adapted for fossorial activity all belong to the caniform suborder of carnivoran mammals the species of mustelid badgers are grouped in four subfamilies melinae species including the european badger helictidinae species of mellivorinae the honey badger or ratel and taxideinae the american badger the respective genera are arctonyx meles melogale mellivora and taxidea badgers include the most basal mustelids the american badger is the most basal of all followed successively by the ratel and melinae the estimated split dates are about and million years ago respectively the two species of asiatic stink badgers of the genus mydaus were formerly included within melinae and thus mustelidae but more recent genetic evidence indicates these are actually members of the skunk family mephitidae badger mandibular condyles connect to long cavities in their skulls which gives resistance to jaw dislocation and increases their bite grip strength this in turn limits jaw movement to hinging open and shut or sliding from side to side but it does not hamper the twisting movement possible for the jaws of most mammals badgers have rather short wide bodies with short legs for digging they have elongated heads with small ears their tails vary in length depending on species the stink badger has a very short tail while the ferret badger tail can be cm in long depending on age they have black faces with distinctive white markings grey bodies with a stripe from head to tail and dark legs with underbellies they grow to around cm in in length including tail the european badger is one of the largest the american badger the hog badger and the honey badger are generally a little smaller and lighter stink badgers are smaller still and ferret badgers smallest of all they weigh around kg lb while some eurasian badgers weigh around kg lb etymology the word badger originally applied to the european badger meles meles comes from earlier bageard century presumably referring to the white mark borne like a badge on its forehead similarly a now archaic synonym was bauson a variant of bausond piebald from old french bausant baucent less common name brock old english brocc scots brock is a celtic loanword cf gaelic broc and welsh broch from brokkos meaning grey the term was thahsuz cf german dachs dutch das norwegian svintoks early modern english dasse probably from the pie root to construct so the badger would have been named after its digging of setts tunnels the germanic term thahsuz became taxus or

the majority of their interactions seem to be mutual or neutral american badgers and coyotes have been seen hunting together in a cooperative fashion diet the diet of the eurasian badger consists largely of earthworms especially lumbricus terrestris insects grubs and the eggs and young of birds they also eat small mammals amphibians reptiles and birds as well as roots and fruit in britain they are the main predator of hedgehogs which have demonstrably lower populations in areas where badgers are numerous so much so that hedgehog rescue societies do not release hedgehogs into known badger

environment food and rural affairs however it was later deferred and a wide range of reasons given in august a full culling programme began whereby it was expected that about badgers would be killed over six weeks in west somerset and gloucestershire using a mixture of controlled shooting and free shooting some badgers were to be trapped in cages first the cull caused many protests with emotional economic and scientific reasons being cited the badger is considered an iconic species of the british countryside and it has been claimed by shadow ministers that the government own figures show it will cost more than it saves and lord krebs who led the randomised badger culling trial in the said the two pilots will not yield any useful information food although rarely eaten today in the united
