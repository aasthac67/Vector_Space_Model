albatrosses are very large seabirds in the family diomedeidae albatrosses they range widely in the southern ocean and the north pacific they are absent from the north atlantic although fossil remains show they once occurred there and occasional vagrants are found albatrosses are among the largest of flying birds and species of the genus diomedea great albatrosses have the longest wingspans of any extant birds reaching up to m ft the albatrosses are usually regarded as falling into four genera but disagreement exists over the number of species albatrosses are highly efficient in the air using dynamic soaring and slope soaring to cover great distances with little exertion it is the only bird that can fly miles km without landing they feed on squid fish and krill by either scavenging surface seizing or diving albatrosses are colonial nesting for the most part on remote oceanic islands often with several species nesting together pair bonds between males and females form over several years with the use of ritualised dances and last for the life of the pair a breeding season can take over a year from laying to fledging with a single egg laid in each breeding attempt a laysan albatross named wisdom on midway island is recognised as the oldest wild bird in the world she was first banded in by chandler robbins of the species of albatrosses recognised by the iucn all are listed as at some level of concern three species are critically endangered five species are endangered seven species are near threatened and seven species are vulnerable numbers of albatrosses have declined in the past due to harvesting for feathers albatrosses are threatened by introduced species such as rats and feral cats that attack eggs chicks and nesting adults by pollution by a serious decline in fish stocks in many regions largely due to overfishing and by longline fishing longline fisheries pose the greatest threat as feeding birds are attracted to the bait become hooked on the lines and drown identified stakeholders such as governments conservation organisations and people in the fishing industry are all working toward reducing this bycatch science taxonomy and evolution the albatross designation comprises between and species the number is still a matter of some debate being the most commonly accepted number in four genera these genera are the great albatrosses diomedea the mollymawks thalassarche the north pacific albatrosses phoebastria and the sooty albatrosses or sooties phoebetria the north pacific albatrosses are considered to be a sister taxon to the great albatrosses while the sooty albatrosses are considered closer to the mollymawksthe taxonomy of the albatross group has been a source of much debate the taxonomy places seabirds birds of prey and many others in a greatly enlarged order the ciconiiformes whereas the ornithological organisations in north america europe south africa australia and new zealand retain the more traditional order procellariiformes the albatrosses can be separated from the other procellariiformes both genetically and through morphological characteristics size their legs and the arrangement of their nasal tubes see below morphology and flight within the family the assignment of genera has been debated for over years originally placed into a single genus diomedea they were rearranged by reichenbach into four different genera in then lumped back together and split apart again several times acquiring different genus names in total though never more than eight at one time by diomedea phoebastria thalassarche phoebetria thalassageron diomedella nealbatrus rhothonia julietata galapagornis laysanornis and penthirenia by in an attempt to bring some order back to the classification of albatrosses they were lumped into two genera phoebetria the sooty albatrosses which most closely seemed to resemble the procellarids and were at the time considered primitive and diomedea the rest though a case was made for the simplification of the family particularly the nomenclature the classification was based on the morphological analysis by elliott coues in and paid little attention to more recent studies and even ignored some of coues suggestionsmore recent research by gary nunn of the american museum of natural history and other researchers around the world studied the mitochondrial dna of all accepted species finding four not two monophyletic groups within the albatrosses they proposed the resurrection of two of the old genus names phoebastria for the north pacific albatrosses and thalassarche for the mollymawks with the great albatrosses retaining diomedea and the sooty albatrosses staying in phoebetria both the british ornithologists union and the south african authorities split the albatrosses into four genera as nunn suggested and the change has been accepted by the majority of researchers while some agree on the number of genera fewer agree on the number of species historically up to different taxa have been described by different researchers most of these were incorrectly identified juvenile birds based on the work on albatross genera robertson and nunn went on in to propose a revised taxonomy with different species compared to the then accepted this expanded taxonomy elevated many established subspecies to full species but was criticised for not using in every case peer reviewed information to justify the splits since then further studies have in some instances supported or disproved the splits a paper analysing the mitochondrial dna and microsatellites agreed with the conclusion that the antipodean albatross and the tristan albatross were distinct from the wandering albatross per robertson and nunn but found that the suggested gibson albatross diomedea gibsoni was not distinct from the antipodean albatross for the most part an interim taxonomy of species is accepted by itis and many other researchers though by no means penhallurick and wink called for the number of species to be reduced to including the lumping of the amsterdam albatross with the wandering albatross although this paper was itself controversial on all sides is the widespread agreement on the need for further research to clarify the issue sibley and ahlquist molecular study of the evolution of the bird families has put the radiation of the procellariiformes in the oligocene period million years ago mya though this group probably originated earlier with a fossil sometimes attributed to the order a seabird known as tytthostonyx being found in late cretaceous rocks mya the molecular evidence suggests that the storm petrels were the first to diverge from the ancestral stock and the albatrosses next with the procellarids and diving petrels separating later the earliest fossil albatrosses were found in eocene to oligocene rocks although some of these are only tentatively assigned to the family and none appear to be particularly close to the living forms they are murunkus middle eocene of uzbekistan manu early oligocene of new zealand and an undescribed form from the late oligocene of south carolina the oldest widely accepted fossil albatross is tydea septentrionalis from the early oligocene of belgium diomedavus knapptonensis is smaller than all extant albatrosses and was found in late oligocene strata of washington state usa plotornis was formerly often considered a petrel but is now accepted as an albatross it is from the middle miocene of france a time when the split between the four modern genera was already underway as evidenced by phoebastria californica and diomedea milleri both being species from sharktooth hill california these show that the split between the great albatrosses and the north pacific albatrosses occurred by mya similar fossil finds in the southern hemisphere put the split between the sooties and mollymawks at mya the fossil record of the albatrosses in the northern hemisphere is more complete than that of the southern and many fossil forms of albatross have been found in the north atlantic which today has no albatrosses the remains of a colony of albatrosses have been uncovered on the island of bermuda and the majority of fossil albatrosses from the north atlantic have been of the genus phoebastria the north pacific albatrosses one phoebastria anglica has been found in deposits in both north carolina and england due to convergent evolution in particular of the leg and foot bones remains of the prehistoric pseudotooth birds pelagornithidae may be mistaken for those of extinct albatrosses manu may be such a case and quite certainly the supposed giant albatross femur from the early pleistocene dainichi formation at kakegawa japan actually is from one of the last pseudotooth birds aldiomedes angustirostris was a uniquely species from the pliocene of new zealand the articles on diomedea phoebastria and thalassarche contain more data on fossil species of living albatross genera morphology and flight the albatrosses are a group of large to very large birds they are the largest of the procellariiformes the bill is large strong and with the upper mandible terminating in a large hook this bill is composed of several horny plates and along the sides are the two tubes long nostrils that give the order its former name the tubes of all albatrosses are along the sides of the bill unlike the rest of the procellariiformes where the tubes run along the top of the bill these tubes allow the albatrosses to measure the exact airspeed in flight the nostrils are analogous to the pitot tubes in modern aircraft the albatross needs accurate airspeed measurement in order to perform dynamic soaring like other procellariiformes they use their uniquely developed sense of smell to locate potential food sources whereas most birds depend on eyesight the feet have no hind toe and the three anterior toes are completely webbed the legs are strong for procellariiformes making them and the giant petrels the only members of that order that can walk well on landalbatrosses along with all procellariiformes must excrete the salts they ingest in drinking sea water and eating marine invertebrates all birds have an enlarged nasal gland at the base of the bill above their eyes this gland is inactive in species that do not require it but in the procellariiformes it acts as a salt gland scientists are uncertain as to its exact processes but do know in general terms that it removes salt by secreting a saline solution that drips out of their noses or is forcibly ejected the adult plumage of most of the albatrosses is usually some variation of dark and back with white undersides often compared to that of a gull the extent of colouration varies the southern royal albatross is almost completely white except for the ends and trailing edges of the wings in fully mature males while the amsterdam albatross has an almost breeding plumage with a great deal of brown particularly a strong brown band around the chest several species of mollymawks and north pacific albatrosses have face markings like eye patches or have grey or yellow on the head and nape three albatross species the albatross and the two sooty albatrosses vary completely from the usual patterns and are almost entirely dark brown or dark grey in places in the case of the albatross albatrosses take several years to get their full adult breeding plumagethe wingspans of the largest great albatrosses genus diomedea are the largest of any bird exceeding cm ft although the other species wingspans are considerably smaller at down to m ft the wings are stiff and cambered with thickened streamlined leading edges albatrosses travel huge distances with two techniques used by many seabirds dynamic soaring and slope soaring dynamic soaring involves repeatedly rising into wind and descending downwind thus gaining energy from the vertical wind gradient the only effort expended is in the turns at the top and bottom of every such loop this maneuver allows the bird to cover almost without flapping its wings slope soaring uses the rising air on the windward side of large waves albatross have high glide ratios around to meaning that for every metre they drop they can travel forward metres they are aided in soaring by a a sheet of tendon that locks the wing when fully extended allowing the wing to be kept outstretched without any muscle expenditure a morphological adaptation they share with the giant petrels albatrosses combine these soaring techniques with the use of predictable weather systems albatrosses in the southern hemisphere flying north from their colonies take a clockwise route and those flying south fly counterclockwise albatrosses are so well adapted to this lifestyle that their heart rates while flying are close to their basal heart rate when resting this efficiency is such that the most energetically demanding aspect of a foraging trip is not the distance covered but the landings and hunting they undertake having found a food source a common assumption is that albatrosses must be able to sleep in flight although no direct evidence has ever been obtainedthis efficient travelling underlies the albatross success as a forager covering great distances and expending little energy looking for patchily distributed food sources their adaptation to gliding flight makes them dependent on wind and waves but their long wings are to powered flight and most species lack the muscles and energy to undertake sustained flapping flight albatrosses in calm seas rest on the ocean surface until the wind picks up again as using powered flight is not energetically worthwhile though they are capable of flight to avoid danger the north pacific albatrosses can use a flight style known as where the bird progresses by bursts of flapping followed by gliding when taking off albatrosses need to take a run up to allow enough air to move under the wing to provide liftthe dynamic soaring of albatrosses is inspiring to airplane designers german aerospace engineer johannes traugott and colleagues have charted the albatross nuanced flight pattern and are looking for ways to apply this to aircraft especially in the area of drones and unmanned aircraft distribution and range at sea most albatrosses range in the southern hemisphere from antarctica to australia south africa and south america the exceptions to this are the four north pacific albatrosses of which three occur exclusively in the north pacific from hawaii to japan california and alaska and one the waved albatross breeds in the galapagos islands and feeds off the coast of south america the need for wind to enable gliding is the reason albatrosses are for the most part confined to higher latitudes being unsuited to sustained flapping flight makes crossing the doldrums extremely difficult the exception the waved albatross is able to live in the equatorial waters around the galapagos islands because of the cool waters of the humboldt current and the resulting windsit is not known for certain why the albatrosses became extinct in the north atlantic although rising sea levels due to an interglacial warming period are thought to have submerged the site of a albatross colony that has been excavated in bermuda some southern species have occasionally turned up as vagrants in the north atlantic and can become exiled remaining there for decades one of these exiles a albatross returned to gannet colonies in scotland for many years in an attempt to breedthe use of satellite tracking is teaching scientists a great deal about the way albatrosses range across the ocean to find food they undertake no annual migration but disperse widely after hemisphere species often undertake circumpolar trips evidence also exists of separate ranges for different species at sea a comparison of the foraging niches of two related species that breed on campbell island the campbell albatross and the albatross showed the campbell albatross primarily fed over the campbell plateau whereas the albatross fed in more pelagic oceanic waters wandering albatrosses also react strongly to bathymetry feeding only in waters deeper than m ft so rigidly did the satellite plots match this contour that one scientist remarked it almost appears as if the birds notice and obey a entry sign where the water shallows to less than m also evidence shows different ranges for the two sexes of the same species a study of tristan albatrosses breeding on gough island showed that males foraged to the west of gough and females to the eastbirdlife has satellite tracking records for each of the species of albatross in their database diet the albatross diet is predominantly cephalopods fish crustaceans and offal organ meat although they will also scavenge carrion and feed on other zooplankton for most species a comprehensive understanding of diet is known for only the breeding season when the albatrosses regularly return to land and study is possible the importance of each of these food sources varies from species to species and even from population to population some concentrate on squid alone others take more krill or fish of the two albatross species found in hawaii one the albatross takes mostly fish while the laysan feeds on squidthe use of data loggers at sea that record ingestion of water against time providing a likely time of feeding suggests that albatrosses predominantly feed during the day analysis of the squid beaks regurgitated by albatrosses has shown that many of the squid eaten are too large to have been caught alive and include species likely to be beyond the reach of albatross suggesting that for some species like the wandering albatross scavenged squid may be an important part of the diet the source of these dead squid is a matter of debate some certainly comes from squid fisheries but in nature it primarily comes from the that occurs after squid spawning and the vomit of whales sperm whales pilot whales and southern bottlenose whales the diet of other species like the albatross or the albatross is rich with smaller species of squid that tend to sink after death and scavenging is not assumed to play a large role in their diet the waved albatross has been observed practising kleptoparasitism harassing boobies to steal their food making it the only member of its order to do so regularlyuntil recently albatrosses were thought to be predominantly surface feeders swimming at the surface and snapping up squid and fish pushed to the surface by currents predators or death the deployment of capillary depth recorders which record the maximum dive depth undertaken by a bird has shown that while some species like the wandering albatross do not dive deeper than a metre some species like the albatross have a mean diving depth of almost m and can dive as deep as m in addition to surface feeding and diving they have also been observed plunge diving from the air to snatch prey breeding and dancing albatrosses are colonial usually nesting on isolated islands where colonies are on larger landmasses they are found on exposed headlands with good approaches from the sea in several directions like the colony on the otago peninsula in dunedin new zealand many buller albatrosses and albatrosses nest under trees in open forest colonies vary from the very dense aggregations favoured by the mollymawks albatross colonies on the falkland islands have densities of nests per to the much looser groups and widely spaced individual nests favoured by the sooty and great albatrosses all albatross colonies are on islands that historically were free of land mammals albatrosses are highly philopatric meaning they usually return to their natal colony to breed this tendency is so strong that a study of laysan albatrosses showed that the average distance between hatching site and the site where a bird established its own territory was m ft albatrosses live much longer than other birds they delay breeding for longer and invest more effort into fewer young most species survive upwards of years the oldest recorded being a laysan albatross named wisdom that was ringed in as a mature adult and hatched another chick in february making her at least years old she is the oldest confirmed wild bird and the oldest banded bird in the worldalbatrosses reach sexual maturity slowly after about five years but even once they have reached maturity they do not begin to breed for another few years even up to years for some species young nonbreeders attend a colony prior to beginning to breed spending many years practising the elaborate breeding rituals and dances for which the family is famous birds arriving back at the colony for the first time already have the stereotyped behaviours that compose albatross language but can neither read that behaviour as exhibited by other birds nor respond appropriately after a period of trial and error learning the young birds learn the syntax and perfect the dances this language is mastered more rapidly if the younger birds are around older birds the repertoire of behaviour involves synchronised performances of various actions such as preening pointing calling bill clacking staring and combinations of such behaviours such as the when a bird first returns to the colony it dances with many partners but after a number of years the number of interactions drops until one partner is chosen and a pair is formed they then continue to perfect an individual language that will eventually be unique to that one pair having established a pair bond that will last for life however most of that dance will never be used again albatrosses are held to undertake these elaborate and painstaking rituals to ensure that the appropriate partner has been chosen and to perfect partner recognition as egg laying and chick rearing is a huge investment even species that can complete an cycle in under a year seldom lay eggs in consecutive years the great albatrosses ie wandering albatross take over a year to raise a chick from laying to fledging albatrosses lay a single subelliptical egg white with spots in a breeding season if the egg is lost to predators or accidentally broken then no further breeding attempts are made that year the larger eggs weigh from to g to oz the divorce of a pair is a rare occurrence due to the diminished lifetime reproductive success it causes and usually happens only after several years of breeding failureall the southern albatrosses create large nests for their egg using grass shrubs soil peat and even penguin feathers whereas the three species in the north pacific make more rudimentary nests the waved albatross though makes no nest and even moves its egg around the pair territory as much as m ft sometimes causing it to lose the egg in all albatross species both parents incubate the egg in stints that last between one day and three weeks incubation lasts around to days longer for the larger albatrosses the longest incubation period of any bird it can be an energetically demanding process with the adult losing as much as g oz of body weight a day after hatching the chick which is semialtricial is brooded and guarded for three weeks until it is large enough to defend and thermoregulate itself during this period the parents feed the chick small meals when they relieve each other from duty after the brooding period is over the chick is fed in regular intervals by both parents the parents adopt alternative patterns of short and long foraging trips providing meals that weigh around of their body weight around g oz the meals are composed of fresh squid fish and krill as well as stomach oil an food that is lighter to carry than undigested prey items this oil is created in a stomach organ known as a proventriculus from digested prey items by most procellariiformes and gives them their distinctive musty smellalbatross chicks take a long time to fledge in the case of the great albatrosses it can take up to days even for the smaller albatrosses it takes between and days like many seabirds albatross chicks will gain enough weight to be heavier than their parents and prior to fledging they use these reserves to build up body condition particularly growing all their flight feathers usually fledging at the same weight as their parents between and of those fledged survive to breed albatross chicks fledge on their own and receive no further help from their parents which return to the nest after fledging unaware their chick has left studies of juveniles dispersing at sea have suggested an innate migration behaviour a genetically coded navigation route which helps young birds when they are first out at seahybridization is rare in albatrosses largely due to the low incidence of vagrancy albatrosses and humans etymology the name albatross is derived from the arabic or a pelican literally the diver which travelled to english via the portuguese form alcatraz gannet which is also the origin of the name of the former prison alcatraz the oxford english dictionary notes that the word alcatraz was originally applied to the frigatebird the modification to albatross was perhaps influenced by latin albus meaning white in contrast to frigatebirds which are black in modern portuguese the word used for the bird albatroz is in turn derived from the english albatross they were once commonly known as goonie birds or gooney birds particularly those of the north pacific in the southern hemisphere the name mollymawk is still well established in some areas which is a corrupted form of an old dutch name for the northern fulmar the name diomedea assigned to the albatrosses by linnaeus references the mythical metamorphosis of the companions of the greek warrior diomedes into birds finally the name for the order procellariiformes comes from the latin word procella meaning a violent wind or a storm in culture albatrosses have been described as the most legendary of all birds an albatross is the central emblem in the rime of the ancient mariner by samuel taylor coleridge representing the innocence and beauty of god creation the albatross metaphor is derived from this poem someone bearing a burden or facing an obstacle is said to have an albatross around his neck the punishment given to the mariner who killed the albatross a widespread myth holds that sailors believe shooting or harming an albatross is disastrous due in part to the poem in truth sailors regularly killed and ate them as reported by james cook in however other sailors reportedly caught the birds but let them free again possibly believing that albatrosses were the souls of lost sailors so killing them would bring bad luck the head of an albatross being caught with a hook is used as the emblem of the cape horners ie sailors who have rounded cape horn on freighters under sail captains of such ships even received themselves the title albatrosses in the cape horners organisation a captive albatross tormented by jeering sailors is also a metaphor for the social travails of the sensitive poete maudit in charles baudelaire poem le poete est semblable au prince des nuees qui hante la tempete et se rit de exile sur le sol au milieu des huees ses ailes de geant de marcher the poet is like this prince of the clouds who haunts the storm and mocks the archer but exiled on earth surrounded by jeers his giant wings make him helpless to walk in golf shooting three under par on a single hole has recently been termed scoring an albatross as a continuation on the birdie and eagle theme mythologies the maori used the wing bones of the albatross to carve flutes in hawaiian mythology laysan albatrosses are considered aumakua being a sacred manifestation of the ancestors and quite possibly also the sacred bird of kane japanese mythology by contrast refers to the albatross as idiot bird due to its insular habitat making it disregard terrestrial predators and it was considered an excellent target for consumption birdwatching albatrosses are popular birds for birdwatchers and their colonies are popular destinations for ecotourists regular birdwatching trips are taken out of many coastal towns and cities such as monterey dunedin kaikoura wollongong sydney port fairy hobart and cape town to see pelagic seabirds albatrosses are easily attracted to these sightseeing boats by the deployment of fish oil and burley into the sea visits to colonies can be very popular the northern royal albatross colony at taiaroa head in dunedin new zealand attracts visitors a year and more isolated colonies are regular attractions on cruises to subantarctic islands threats and conservation in spite of often being accorded legendary status albatrosses have not escaped either indirect or direct pressure from humans early encounters with albatrosses by polynesians and aleuts resulted in hunting and in some cases extirpation from some islands such as easter island as europeans began sailing the world they too began to hunt albatross fishing for them from boats to serve at the table or blasting them for sport this sport reached its peak on emigration lines bound for australia and only died down when ships became too fast to fish from and regulations forbade the discharge of weapons for safety reasons in the century albatross colonies particularly those in the north pacific were harvested for the feather trade leading to the of the albatrossof the albatross species recognised by iucn on their red list are threatened and the other two are near threatened three species as recognised by the iucn are considered critically endangered the amsterdam albatross tristan albatross and waved albatross one of the main threats is commercial longline fishing as the albatrosses and other will readily feed on attracted to the set bait become hooked on the lines and drown an estimated albatross per year are killed in this fashion unregulated pirate fisheries exacerbate the problemon midway atoll collisions between laysan albatrosses and aircraft have resulted in human and bird deaths as well as severe disruptions in military flight operations studies were made in the late and early that examined the results of control methods such as the killing of birds the levelling and clearing of land to eliminate updrafts and the destruction of annual nesting sites tall structures such as traffic control and radio towers killed birds in flight collisions during before the towers were taken down closure of naval air facility midway in eliminated the problem of collisions with military aircraft recent reductions in human activity on the island have helped reduce bird deaths though lead paint pollution near military buildings continues to poison birds by ingestion albatross plumes were popular in the early century in alone over albatrosses were killed on midway island and laysan island for their plumesanother threat to albatrosses is introduced species such as rats or feral cats which directly attack albatrosses or their chicks and eggs albatrosses have evolved to breed on islands where land mammals are absent and have not developed defences against them even species as small as mice can be detrimental on gough island the chicks of tristan albatrosses are attacked and eaten alive by introduced house mice introduced species can have other indirect effects cattle overgrazed essential cover on amsterdam island threatening the amsterdam albatross on other islands introduced plants reduce potential nesting habitat ingestion of plastic flotsam is another problem one faced by many seabirds the amount of plastic in the seas has increased dramatically since the first record in the coming from waste discarded by ships offshore dumping litter on beaches and waste washed to sea by rivers it is impossible to digest and takes up space in the stomach or gizzard that should be used for food or can cause an obstruction that starves the bird directly studies of birds in the north pacific have shown that ingestion of plastics results in declining body weight and body condition this plastic is sometimes regurgitated and fed to chicks a study of laysan albatross chicks on midway atoll showed large amounts of ingested plastic in naturally dead chicks compared to healthy chicks killed in accidents while not the direct cause of death this plastic causes physiological stress and causes the chick to feel full during feedings reducing its food intake and the chances of survivalscientists and conservationists most importantly birdlife international and their partners who run the save the albatross campaign are working with governments and fishermen to find solutions to the threats albatrosses face techniques such as setting longline bait at night dyeing the bait blue setting the bait underwater increasing the amount of weight on lines and using bird scarers can all reduce the seabird bycatch for example a collaborative study between scientists and fishermen in new zealand successfully tested an underwater setting device for longliners which set the lines below the reach of vulnerable albatross species the use of some of these techniques in the patagonian toothfish fishery in the falkland islands is thought to have reduced the number of albatrosses taken by the fleet in the last years conservationists have also worked on the field of island restoration removing introduced species that threaten native wildlife which protects albatrosses from introduced predators one important step towards protecting albatrosses and other seabirds is the treaty the agreement on the conservation of albatrosses and petrels which came into force in and has been ratified by thirteen countries argentina australia brazil chile ecuador france new zealand norway peru south africa spain the united kingdom and uruguay the treaty requires these countries to take specific actions to reduce bycatch pollution and to remove introduced species from nesting islands species current thinking divides the albatrosses into four genera the number of species is a matter of debate the iucn and birdlife international recognise extant species listed below itis recognise the below minus t steadi and one recent paper proposed
