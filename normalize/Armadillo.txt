armadillos meaning little armoured one in spanish are new world placental mammals in the order cingulata the chlamyphoridae and dasypodidae are the only surviving families in the order which is part of the superorder xenarthra along with the anteaters and sloths nine extinct genera and extant species of armadillo have been described some of which are distinguished by the number of bands on their armour all species are native to the americas where they inhabit a variety of different environments armadillos are characterized by a leathery armour shell and long sharp claws for digging they have short legs but can move quite quickly the average length of an armadillo is about cm in including tail the giant armadillo grows up to cm in and weighs up to kg lb while the pink fairy armadillo has a length of only cm in when threatened by a predator tolypeutes species frequently roll up into a ball these being the only species of armadillo capable of such etymology the word armadillo means little armoured one in spanish the aztecs called them ayotochtli nahuatl for ayotl turtle and tochtli rabbit the portuguese word for armadillo is tatu which is derived from the tupi language similar names are also found in other especially european languages classification family dasypodidae subfamily dasypodinae genus dasypus armadillo or armadillo dasypus novemcinctus armadillo dasypus septemcinctus

armadillo tolypeutes matacus brazilian armadillo tolypeutes indicates extinct taxon phylogeny below is a recent simplified phylogeny of the xenarthran families which includes armadillos based on slater et al and delsuc et al the dagger symbol denotes extinct groups evolution recent genetic research suggests that an extinct group of giant armoured mammals the glyptodonts should be included within the lineage of armadillos having diverged some million years ago more recently than previously assumed distribution like all of the xenarthra lineages armadillos originated in south america due to the continent former isolation they were confined there for most of the cenozoic the recent formation of the isthmus of panama allowed a few members of the family to migrate northward into southern north america by the early pleistocene as part of the great american interchange some of their much larger cingulate relatives the pampatheres and chlamyphorid glyptodonts made the same journey today all extant armadillo species are still present in south america they are particularly diverse in paraguay where species exist and surrounding areas many species are endangered some including four species of dasypus are widely distributed over the americas whereas others such as yepes mulita are restricted to small ranges two species the northern armadillo and armadillo are found in central america the latter has also reached the united states primarily in the states notably texas but with a range that extends as far east as north carolina and florida and as far north as southern nebraska and southern indiana their range has consistently expanded in north america over the last century due to a lack of natural predators characteristics size armadillos are small to mammals the smallest species the pink fairy armadillo is roughly at g oz and cm in in total length the largest species the giant armadillo can reach the size of a small pig and weigh up to kg lb and can be cm in long diet and predation they are prolific diggers many species use their sharp claws to dig for food such as grubs and to dig dens the armadillo prefers to build burrows in moist soil near the creeks streams and arroyos around which it lives and feeds the diets of different armadillo species vary but consist mainly of insects grubs and other invertebrates some species however feed almost entirely on ants and termites armadillos have very poor eyesight and use their keen sense of smell to hunt for food they use their claws for digging and finding food as well as for making their homes in burrows they dig their burrows with their claws making only a single corridor the width of the animal body they have five clawed toes on their hind feet and three to five toes with heavy digging claws on their fore feet armadillos have numerous cheek teeth which are not divided into premolars and molars but usually have no incisors or canines the dentition of the armadillo is p m body temperature in common with other xenarthrans armadillos in general have low body temperatures of and low basal metabolic rates of that expected in placental mammals of their mass this is particularly true of types that specialize in using termites as their primary food source for example priodontes and tolypeutes skin the armour is formed by plates of dermal bone covered in relatively small overlapping epidermal scales called scutes composed of bone with a covering of horn most species have rigid shields over the shoulders and hips with a number of bands separated by flexible skin covering the back and flanks additional armour covers the top of the head the upper parts of the limbs and the tail the underside of the animal is never armoured and is simply covered with soft skin and furthis skin appears to be the main defense of many armadillos although most escape predators by fleeing often into thorny patches from which their armour protects them or digging to safety only the south american armadillos tolypeutes rely heavily on their armour for protection defensive behavior when threatened by a predator tolypeutes species frequently roll up into a ball other armadillo species can not roll up because they have too many plates the north american armadillo tends to jump straight in the air when surprised so consequently often collides with the undercarriage or fenders of passing vehicles to its demise movement armadillos have short legs but can move quite quickly the armadillo is noted for its movement through water which is accomplished via two different methods it can walk underwater for short distances holding its breath for as long as six minutes also to cross larger bodies of water it is capable of increasing its buoyancy by swallowing air inflating its stomach and intestines reproduction gestation lasts from to days depending on species although the armadillo also exhibits delayed implantation so the young are not typically born for eight months after mating most members of the genus dasypus give birth to four monozygotic young that is identical quadruplets but other species may have typical litter sizes that range from one to eight the young are born with soft leathery skin which hardens within a few weeks they reach sexual maturity in three to twelve months depending on the species armadillos are solitary animals that do not share their burrows with other adults armadillos and humans in science disease armadillos are often used in the study of leprosy since they along with mangabey monkeys rabbits and mice on their footpads are among the few known species that can contract the disease systemically they are particularly susceptible due to their unusually low body temperature which is hospitable to the leprosy bacterium mycobacterium leprae the leprosy bacterium is difficult to culture and armadillos have a body temperature of similar to human skin humans can acquire a leprosy infection from armadillos by handling them or consuming armadillo meat armadillos are a presumed vector and natural reservoir for the disease in texas louisiana and florida prior to the arrival of europeans in the late century leprosy was unknown in the new world given that armadillos are native to the new world at some point they must have acquired the disease from humansthe armadillo is also a natural reservoir for chagas disease reproduction the armadillo also serves science through its unusual reproductive system in which four genetically identical offspring are born the result of one original egg because they are always genetically identical the group of four young provides a good subject for scientific behavioral or medical tests that need consistent biological and genetic makeup in the test subjects this is the only reliable manifestation of polyembryony in the class mammalia and exists only within the genus dasypus and not in all armadillos as is commonly believed other species that display this trait include parasitoid wasps certain flatworms and various aquatic invertebrates education armadillos mainly dasypus are common roadkill due to their habit of jumping ft vertically when startled which puts them into collision with the underside of vehicles wildlife enthusiasts are using the northward march of the armadillo as an opportunity to educate others about the animals which can be a burrowing nuisance to property owners and managers as musical instruments armadillo shells have traditionally been used to make the back of the charango an andean lute instrument as food in certain parts of central and south america armadillo meat is eaten it is a popular ingredient in oaxaca mexico during the great depression americans were known to eat armadillo known begrudgingly as hoover hogs a nod to the belief that herbert hoover was responsible for the economic despair facing the nation at that time in literature a whimsical account of the beginning of the armadillos is one of the chapters of
