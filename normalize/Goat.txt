the domestic goat or simply goat capra aegagrus hircus is a subspecies of c aegagrus domesticated from the wild goat of southwest asia and eastern europe the goat is a member of the animal family bovidae and the subfamily caprinae meaning it is closely related to the sheep there are over distinct breeds of goat goats are one of the oldest domesticated species of animal and have been used for milk meat fur and skins across much of the world milk from goats is often turned into goat cheese female goats are referred to as does or nannies intact males are called bucks or billies and juvenile goats of both sexes are called kids castrated males are called wethers while the words hircine and caprine both refer to anything having a quality hircine is used most often to emphasize the distinct smell of domestic goats in there were more than million goats living in the world according to the un food and agriculture organization etymology the modern english word goat comes from old english gat goat in general which in turn derives from gaitaz cf geit german geiss and gothic gaits ultimately from ghaidos meaning young goat cf latin haedus kid itself perhaps from a root meaning jump assuming that old church slavonic zajeci hare sanskrit jihite he moves are related to refer to the male old english used bucca giving modern buck until ousted by hegote hegoote in the late century nanny goat females originated in the century and billy goat for males in the history goats are among the earliest animals domesticated by humans the most recent genetic analysis confirms the archaeological evidence that the wild bezoar ibex of the zagros mountains is the likely original ancestor of probably all domestic goats todayneolithic farmers began to herd wild goats primarily for easy access to milk and meat as well as to their dung which was used as fuel and their bones hair and sinew for clothing building and tools the earliest remnants of domesticated goats dating years before present are found in ganj dareh in iran goat remains have been found at archaeological sites in jericho choga mami djeitun and cayonu dating the domestication of goats in western asia at between and years agostudies of dna evidence suggests years bp as the domestication datehistorically goat hide has been used for water and wine bottles in both traveling and transporting wine for sale it has also been used to produce parchment anatomy and health each recognized breed of goat has specific weight ranges which vary from over kg lb for bucks of larger breeds such as the boer to to kg to lb for smaller goat does within each breed different strains or bloodlines may have different recognized sizes at the bottom of the size range are miniature breeds such as the african pygmy which stand to cm to in at the shoulder as adults horns most goats naturally have two horns of various shapes and sizes depending on the breed there have been incidents of polycerate goats having as many as eight horns although this is a genetic rarity thought to be inherited unlike cattle goats have not been successfully bred to be reliably polled as the genes determining sex and those determining horns are closely linked breeding together two genetically polled goats results in a high number of intersex individuals among the offspring which are typically sterile their horns are made of living bone surrounded by keratin and other proteins and are used for defense dominance and territoriality digestion and lactation goats are ruminants they have a stomach consisting of the rumen the reticulum the omasum and the abomasum as with other mammal ruminants they are ungulates the females have an udder consisting of two teats in contrast to cattle which have four teats an exception to this is the boer goat which sometimes may have up to eight teats eyes goats have horizontal pupils because goats irises are usually pale their contrasting pupils are much more noticeable than in animals such as cattle deer most horses and many sheep whose similarly horizontal pupils blend into a dark iris and sclera beards both male and female goats have beards and many types of goat most commonly dairy goats boers and pygmy goats may have wattles one dangling from each side of the neck tan goats expressing the tan pattern have coats pigmented completely with phaeomelanin pigment the allele which codes for this pattern is located at the agouti locus of the goat genome it is completely dominant to all other alleles at this locus there are multiple modifier genes which control how much tan pigment is actually expressed so a goat can have a coat ranging from pure white to deep red reproduction goats reach puberty between three and months of age depending on breed and nutritional status many breeders prefer to postpone breeding until the doe has reached of the adult weight however this separation is rarely possible in extensively managed herdsin temperate climates and among the swiss breeds the breeding season commences as the day length shortens and ends in early spring or before in equatorial regions goats are able to breed at any time of the year successful breeding in these regions depends more on available forage than on day length does of any breed or region come into estrus heat every days for two to hours a doe in heat typically flags vigorously wags her tail often stays near the buck if one is present becomes more vocal and may also show a decrease in appetite and milk production for the duration of the heat bucks intact males of swiss and northern breeds come into rut in the fall as with the does heat cycles bucks of equatorial breeds may show seasonal reduced fertility but as with the does are capable of breeding at all times rut is characterized by a decrease in appetite and obsessive interest in the does a buck in rut will display flehmen lip curling and will urinate on his forelegs and face sebaceous scent glands at the base of the horns add to the male goat odor which is important to make him attractive to the female some does will not mate with a buck which has been descentedin addition to natural traditional mating artificial insemination has gained popularity among goat breeders as it allows easy access to a wide variety of bloodlines gestation length is approximately days twins are the usual result with single and triplet births also common less frequent are litters of quadruplet quintuplet and even sextuplet kids birthing known as kidding generally occurs uneventfully just before kidding the doe will have a sunken area around the tail and hip as well as heavy breathing she may have a worried look become restless and display great affection for her keeper the mother often eats the placenta which gives her nutrients helps stanch her bleeding and parallels the behavior of wild herbivores such as deer to reduce the lure of the birth scent for predatorsfreshening coming into milk production occurs at kidding milk production varies with the breed age quality and diet of the doe dairy goats generally produce between and kg and lb of milk per lactation on average a good quality dairy doe will give at least kg lb of milk per day while she is in milk a milker may produce less or as much as kg lb or more of milk in exceptional cases after the lactation the doe will dry off typically after she has been bred occasionally goats that have not been bred and are continuously milked will continue lactation beyond the typical days meat fiber and pet breeds are not usually milked and simply produce enough for the kids until weaning male lactation is also known to occur in goats diet goats are reputed to be willing to eat almost anything including tin cans and cardboard boxes while goats will not actually eat inedible material they are browsing animals not grazers like cattle and sheep and coupled with their highly curious nature will chew on and taste just about anything remotely resembling plant matter to decide whether it is good to eat including cardboard clothing and paper such as labels from tin cans the unusual smells of leftover food in discarded cans or boxes may further stimulate their curiosity aside from sampling many things goats are quite particular in what they actually consume preferring to browse on the tips of woody shrubs and trees as well as the occasional plant however it can fairly be said that their plant diet is extremely varied and includes some species which are otherwise toxic they will seldom consume soiled food or contaminated water unless facing starvation this is one reason is most often since involves extensive upkeep and is seldom commercially viable goats prefer to browse on vines such as kudzu on shrubbery and on weeds more like deer than sheep preferring them to grasses nightshade is poisonous wilted fruit tree leaves can also kill goats silage fermented corn stalks and haylage fermented grass hay can be used if consumed immediately after opening goats are particularly sensitive to listeria bacteria that can grow in fermented feeds alfalfa a plant is widely fed as hay fescue is the least palatable and least nutritious hay mold in a goat feed can make it sick and possibly kill it in various places in china goats are used in the production of tea goats are released onto the tea terraces where they avoid consuming the green tea leaves which contain bitter tasting substances but instead eat the weeds the goats droppings fertilise the tea plantsthe digestive physiology of a very young kid like the young of other ruminants is essentially the same as that of a monogastric animal milk digestion begins in the abomasum the milk having bypassed the rumen via closure of the reticuloesophageal groove during suckling at birth the rumen is undeveloped but as the kid begins to consume solid feed the rumen soon increases in size and in its capacity to absorb nutrients the adult size of a particular goat is a product of its breed genetic potential and its diet while growing nutritional potential as with all livestock increased protein diets to and sufficient calories during the prepuberty period yield higher growth rates and larger eventual size than lower protein rates and limited calories goats with a greater skeletal size reach mature weight at a later age to months than goats to months if both are fed to their full potential goats need more calories than goats for maintenance of daily functions behavior goats are naturally curious they are also agile and well known for their ability to climb and balance in precarious places this makes them the only ruminant to regularly climb trees due to their agility and inquisitiveness they are notorious for escaping their pens by testing fences and enclosures either intentionally or simply because they are used to climbing if any of the fencing can be overcome goats will almost inevitably escape goats have been found to be as intelligent as dogs by some studieswhen handled as a group goats tend to display less herding behavior than sheep when grazing undisturbed they tend to spread across the field or range rather than feed side by side as do sheep when nursing young goats will leave their kids separated lying out rather than clumped as do sheep they will generally turn and face an intruder and bucks are more likely to charge or butt at humans than are ramsa study by queen mary university reports that goats try to communicate with people in the same manner as domesticated animals such as dogs and horses goats were first domesticated as livestock more than years ago research conducted to test communication skills found that the goats will look to a human for assistance when faced with a challenge that had previously been mastered but was then modified specifically when presented with a box the goat was able to remove the lid and retrieve a treat inside but when the box was turned so the lid could not be removed the goat would turn and gaze at the person and move toward them before looking back toward the box this is the same type of complex communication observed by animals bred as domestic pets such as dogs researchers believe that better understanding of interaction could offer overall improvement in the animals welfare the field of anthrozoology has established that domesticated animals have the capacity for complex communication with humans when in a japanese scientist determined that levels of oxytocin did increase in human subjects when dogs were exposed to a dose of the love hormone proving that a bond does exist this is the same affinity that was proven with the london study above goats are intelligent capable of complex communication and able to form bonds diseases while goats are generally considered hardy animals and in many situations receive little medical care they are subject to a number of diseases among the conditions affecting goats are respiratory diseases including pneumonia foot rot internal parasites pregnancy toxosis and feed toxicity feed toxicity can vary based on breed and location certain foreign fruits and vegetables can be toxic to different breeds of goats goats can become infected with various viral and bacterial diseases such as disease caprine arthritis encephalitis caseous lymphadenitis pinkeye mastitis and pseudorabies they can transmit a number of zoonotic diseases to people such as tuberculosis brucellosis and rabies life expectancy life expectancy for goats is between and years an instance of a goat reaching the age of has been reportedseveral factors can reduce this average expectancy problems during kidding can lower a doe expected life span to or and stresses of going into rut can lower a buck expected life span to eight to years agriculture a goat is useful to humans when it is living and when it is dead first as a renewable provider of milk manure and fiber and then as meat and hide some charities provide goats to impoverished people in poor countries because goats are easier and cheaper to manage than cattle and have multiple uses in addition goats are used for driving and packing purposes the intestine of goats is used to make catgut which is still in use as a material for internal human surgical sutures and strings for musical instruments the horn of the goat which signifies plenty and wellbeing the cornucopia is also used to make spoons worldwide goat population statistics according to the food and agriculture organization fao the top producers of goat milk in were india million metric tons bangladesh million metric tons and the sudan million metric tons india slaughters of million goats each year the million metric tonnes of goat meat make up of india annual meat production approximately million goats are slaughtered each year for meat worldwide husbandry husbandry or animal care and use varies by region and culture the particular housing used for goats depends not only on the intended use of the goat but also on the region of the world where they are raised historically domestic goats were generally kept in herds that wandered on hills or other grazing areas often tended by goatherds who were frequently children or adolescents similar to the more widely known shepherd these methods of herding are still used today in some parts of the world especially europe and north america distinct breeds of goats are kept for dairy milk and for meat production excess male kids of dairy breeds are typically slaughtered for meat both does and bucks of meat breeds may be slaughtered for meat as well as older animals of any breed the meat of older bucks more than one year old is generally considered not desirable for meat for human consumption castration at a young age prevents the development of typical buck odor dairy goats are generally pastured in summer and may be stabled during the winter as dairy does are milked daily they are generally kept close to the milking shed their grazing is typically supplemented with hay and concentrates stabled goats may be kept in stalls similar to horses or in larger group pens in the us system does are generally rebred annually in some european commercial dairy systems the does are bred only twice and are milked continuously for several years after the second kidding meat goats are more frequently pastured and may be kept many miles from barns angora and other fiber breeds are also kept on pasture or range and pastured goats may be supplemented with hay or concentrates most frequently during the winter or dry seasons in the indian subcontinent and much of asia goats are kept largely for milk production both in commercial and household settings the goats in this area may be kept closely housed or may be allowed to range for fodder the salem black goat is herded to pasture in fields and along roads during the day but is kept penned at night for africa and the mideast goats are typically run in flocks with sheep this maximizes the production per acre as goats and sheep prefer different food plants multiple types of are found in ethiopia where four main types have been identified pastured in annual crop systems in perennial crop systems with cattle and in arid areas under pastoral nomadic herding systems in all four systems however goats were typically kept in extensive systems with few purchased inputs household goats are traditionally kept in nigeria while many goats are allowed to wander the homestead or village others are kept penned and fed in what is called a system this type of husbandry is also used in parts of latin america which refers to the practice of cutting down grasses corn or cane for feed rather than allowing the animal access to the field is particularly suited for types of feed such as corn or cane that are easily destroyed by tramplingpet goats may be found in many parts of the world when a family keeps one or more animals for emotional reasons rather than as production animals it is becoming more common for goats to be kept exclusively as pets in north america and europe meat the taste of goat kid meat is similar to that of spring lamb meat in fact in the islands of the caribbean and in some parts of asia particularly bangladesh pakistan and india the word mutton is used to describe both goat and sheep meat however some compare the taste of goat meat to veal or venison depending on the age and condition of the goat its flavor is said to be primarily linked to the presence of and acid it can be prepared in a variety of ways including stewing baking grilling barbecuing canning and frying it can be minced curried or made into sausage due to its low fat content the meat can toughen at high temperatures if cooked without additional moisture one of the most popular goats grown for meat is the south african boer introduced into the united states in the early the new zealand kiko is also considered a meat breed as is the myotonic or fainting goat a breed originating in tennessee milk butter and cheese goats produce about of the world total annual milk supply some goats are bred specifically for milk if the buck is not separated from the does his scent will affect the milk goat milk naturally has small fat globules which means the cream remains suspended in the milk instead of rising to the top as in raw cow milk therefore it does not need to be homogenized indeed if the milk is to be used to make cheese homogenization is not recommended as this changes the structure of the milk affecting the culture ability to coagulate the milk and the final quality and yield of cheesedairy goats in their prime generally around the third or fourth lactation cycle to kg to lb milk production to l to us qt a lactation producing more just after freshening and gradually dropping in production toward the end of their lactation the milk generally averages butterfatgoat milk is commonly processed into cheese butter ice cream yogurt cajeta and other products goat cheese is known as fromage de chevre goat cheese in france some varieties include rocamadour and montrachet goat butter is white because goats produce milk with the yellow converted to a colorless form of vitamin a goat milk has less cholesterol nutrition the american academy of pediatrics discourages feeding infants milk derived from goats an april case report summarizes their recommendation and presents a comprehensive review of the consequences associated with this dangerous practice also stating many infants are exclusively fed unmodified goat milk as a result of cultural beliefs as well as exposure to false online information anecdotal reports have described a host of morbidities associated with that practice including severe electrolyte abnormalities metabolic acidosis megaloblastic anemia allergic reactions including anaphylactic shock hemolytic uremic syndrome and infections untreated caprine brucellosis results in a case fatality rate according to the usda doe milk is not recommended for human infants because it contains inadequate quantities of iron folate vitamins c and d thiamine niacin vitamin and pantothenic acid to meet an infant s nutritional needs and may cause harm to an infant kidneys and could cause metabolic damagethe department of health in the united kingdom has repeatedly released statements stating on various occasions that goats milk is not suitable for babies and infant formulas and formulas based on goats milk protein have not been approved for use in europe and infant milks based on goats milk protein are not suitable as a source of nutrition for infants moreover according to the canadian federal health department health canada most of the dangers of and for feeding unmodified goat milk to infants parallel those associated with unmodified cow milk especially insofar as allergic reactions gohowever some farming groups promote the practice for example small farm today in claimed beneficial use in invalid and convalescent diets proposing that glycerol ethers possibly important in nutrition for nursing infants are much higher in does milk than in cows milk a book on animal breeding claimed that does milk differs from cows or humans milk by having higher digestibility distinct alkalinity higher buffering capacity and certain therapeutic values in human medicine and nutrition george mateljan suggested doe milk can replace ewe milk or cow milk in diets of those who are allergic to certain mammals milk however like cow milk doe milk has lactose sugar and may cause gastrointestinal problems for individuals with lactose intolerance in fact the level of lactose is similar to that of cow milksome researchers and companies producing goat milk products have made claims that goat milk is better for human health than most western cow milk due to it mostly lacking a form of proteins called and instead mostly containing the form which does not metabolize to in the body these compositions vary by breed especially in the nigerian dwarf breed animal and point in the lactation period fiber the angora breed of goats produces long curling lustrous locks of mohair the entire body of the goat is covered with mohair and there are no guard hairs the locks constantly grow to four inches or more in length angora crossbreeds such as the pygora and the nigora have been created to produce mohair cashgora on a smaller animal the wool is shorn twice a year with an average yield of about kg lb most goats have softer insulating hairs nearer the skin and longer guard hairs on the surface the desirable fiber for the textile industry is the former and it goes by several names down cashmere and pashmina the coarse guard hairs are of little value as they are too coarse difficult to spin and difficult to dye the cashmere goat produces a commercial quantity of cashmere wool which is one of the most expensive natural fibers commercially produced cashmere is very fine and soft the cashmere goat fiber is harvested once a year yielding around g oz of down in south asia cashmere is called pashmina from persian pashmina fine wool in the and early centuries kashmir then called cashmere by the british had a thriving industry producing shawls from imported from tibet and tartary through ladakh the shawls were introduced into western europe when the general in chief of the french campaign in egypt sent one to paris since these shawls were produced in the upper kashmir and ladakh region the wool came to be known as cashmere land clearing goats have been used by humans to clear unwanted vegetation for centuries they have been described as eating machines and biological control agents there has been a resurgence of this in north america since when herds were used to clear dry brush from california hillsides thought to be endangered by potential wildfires this form of using goats to clear land is sometimes known as conservation grazing since then numerous public and private agencies have hired private herds from companies such as rent a goat to perform similar tasks this may be expensive and their smell may be a nuisance this practice has become popular in the pacific northwest where they are used to remove invasive species not easily removed by humans including thorned blackberry vines and poison oak chattanooga tn and spartanburg sc have used goats to control kudzu an invasive plant species prevalent in the southeastern united states use for medical training as a goat anatomy and physiology is not too dissimilar from that of humans some countries militaries use goats to train combat medics in the united states goats have become the main animal species used for this purpose after the pentagon phased out using dogs for medical training in the while modern mannequins used in medical training are quite efficient in simulating the behavior of a human body trainees feel that the goat exercise provide s a sense of urgency that only real life trauma can provide as pets some people choose goats as a pet because of their ability to form close bonds with their human guardians because of goats herd mentality they will follow their owners around and form close bonds with them breeds goat breeds fall into overlapping general categories they are generally distributed in those used for dairy fiber meat skins and as companion animals some breeds are also particularly noted as pack goats showing goat breeders clubs frequently hold shows where goats are judged on traits relating to conformation udder quality evidence of high production longevity build and muscling meat goats and pet goats and fiber production and the fiber itself fiber goats people who show their goats usually keep registered stock and the offspring of animals command a higher price registered goats in general are usually if for no other reason than that records have been kept proving their ancestry and the production and other data of their sires dams and other ancestors a registered doe is usually less of a gamble than buying a doe at random as at an auction or sale barn because of these records and the reputation of the breeder children clubs such as also allow goats to be shown children shows often include a showmanship class where the cleanliness and presentation of both the animal and the exhibitor as well as the handler ability and skill in handling the goat are scored in a showmanship class conformation is irrelevant since this is not what is being judged various dairy goat scorecards milking does are systems used for judging shows in the us the american dairy goat association adga scorecard for an adult doe includes a point system of a hundred total with major categories that include general appearance the dairy character of a doe physical traits that aid and increase milk production body capacity and specifically for the mammary system young stock and bucks are judged by different scorecards which place more emphasis on the other three categories general appearance body capacity and dairy character the american goat society ags has a similar but not identical scorecard that is used in their shows the miniature dairy goats may be judged by either of the two scorecards the angora goat scorecard used by the colored angora goat breeder association cagba which covers the white and the colored goats includes evaluation of an animal fleece color density uniformity fineness and general body confirmation disqualifications include a deformed mouth broken down pasterns deformed feet crooked legs abnormalities of testicles missing testicles more than inch split in scrotum and or distorted horns mythology and folklore archaeologists excavating the ancient city of ebla in syria discovered among others the tomb of some king or great noble which included a throne decorated with bronze goat heads that led to this tomb becoming known as the tomb of the lord of the goats according to norse mythology the god of thunder thor has a chariot that is pulled by the goats tanngrisnir and tanngnjostr at night when he sets up camp thor eats the meat of the goats but takes care that all bones remain whole then he wraps the remains up and in the morning the goats always come back to life to pull the chariot when a farmer son who is invited to share the meal breaks one of the goats leg bones to suck the marrow the animal leg remains broken in the morning and the boy is forced to serve thor as a servant to compensate for the damage possibly related the yule goat is one of the oldest scandinavian and northern european yule and christmas symbols and traditions yule goat originally denoted the goat that was slaughtered around yule but it may also indicate a goat figure made out of straw it is also used about the custom of going singing carols and getting food and drinks in return often fruit cakes and sweets going yule goat is similar to the british custom wassailing both with heathen roots the gavle goat is a giant version of the yule goat erected every year in the swedish city of gavle the greek god pan is said to have the upper body of a man and the horns and lower body of a goat pan was a very lustful god nearly all of the myths involving him had to do with him chasing nymphs he is also credited with creating the pan flute the goat is one of the cycle of animals which appear in the chinese zodiac related to the chinese calendar each animal is associated with certain personality traits those born in a year of the goat are predicted to be shy introverted creative and perfectionist several mythological hybrid creatures are believed to consist of parts of the goat including the chimera the capricorn sign in the western zodiac is usually depicted as a goat with a fish tail fauns and satyrs are mythological creatures that are part goat and part human the mineral bromine is named from the greek word bromos which means stench of popular christian folk tradition in europe associated satan with imagery of goats a common superstition in the middle ages was that goats whispered lewd sentences in the ears of the saints the origin of this belief was probably the behavior of the buck in rut the very epitome of lust the common medieval depiction of the devil was that of a face with horns and small beard a goatee the black mass a probably mythological satanic mass involved satan manifesting as a black goat for worship the goat has had a lingering connection with satanism and pagan religions even into modern times the inverted pentagram a symbol used in satanism is said to be shaped like a goat head the baphomet of mendes refers to a satanic figure from occultism in finland the tradition of knut day january young men dressed as goats finnish nuuttipukki who visit houses usually the dress was an inverted fur jacket a leather or birch bark mask and horns unlike the analogues santa claus nuuttipukki was a scary character cf krampus the men dressed as nuuttipukki wandered from house to house came in and typically demanded food from the household and especially leftover alcoholic beverages in finland the nuuttipukki tradition is still kept alive in areas of satakunta southwest finland and ostrobothnia however nowadays the character is usually played by children and now involves a happy encounterthe common russian surname kozlov russian means goat goatee refers to a style of facial hair incorporating hair on a man chin so named because of some similarity to a goat facial feature religion goats are mentioned many times in the bible their importance in ancient israel is indicated by the seven different hebrew and three greek terms used in the bible a goat is considered a clean animal by jewish dietary laws and a kid was slaughtered for an honored guest it was also acceptable for some kinds of sacrifices curtains were used in the tent that contained the tabernacle exodus its horns can be used instead of sheep horn to make a shofar on yom kippur the festival of the day of atonement two goats were chosen and lots were drawn for them one was sacrificed and the other allowed to escape into the wilderness symbolically carrying with it the sins of the community from this comes the word scapegoat a leader or king was sometimes compared to a male goat leading the flock in the new testament matthew jesus returned to jerusalem the first day of the week sunday before his crucifixion having visited the jewish temple jesus met with his disciples on the mount of olives outside the city at the end of an extended discourse he told of a time after his resurrection when he would return in glory and sit in judgement of gentile nations of the world using a metaphor of the sheep and the goats commonly sheep and goats grazed together in mixed herdsin matthew jesus said that like a shepherd he will separate the nations placing on his right hand the sheep those who have shown kindness to needy and suffering disciples of jesus and others these he will reward but the goats at his left hand who failed to show kindness will be punished although both sheep and goats were valued as livestock this preference for sheep may relate to the importance of wool and the superior meat of adult sheep compared to the poor meat of adult goats feral goats goats readily revert to the wild become feral if given the opportunity the only domestic animal known to return to feral life as swiftly is the cat feral goats have established themselves in many areas they occur in australia new zealand great britain the galapagos and in many other places when feral goats reach large populations in habitats which provide unlimited water supply and which do not contain sufficient large predators or which are otherwise vulnerable to goats aggressive grazing habits they may have serious effects such as removing native scrub trees and other vegetation which is required by a wide range of other creatures not just other grazing or browsing animals feral goats are common in australia however in other circumstances where predator pressure is maintained they may be accommodated into some balance in the local food web see also goat tower chimera hybrid references external
