the wild boar sus scrofa also known as the wild swine common wild pig or simply wild pig is a suid native to much of eurasia and north africa and has been introduced to the americas and oceania the species is now one of the mammals in the world as well as the most widespread suiform it has been assessed as least concern on the iucn red list due to its wide range high numbers and adaptability to a diversity of habitats it has become an invasive species in part of its introduced range wild boars probably originated in southeast asia during the early pleistocene and outcompeted other suid species as they spread throughout the old worldas of up to subspecies are recognized which are divided into four regional groupings based on skull height and lacrimal bone length the species lives in matriarchal societies consisting of interrelated females and their young both male and female fully grown males are usually solitary outside the breeding season the grey wolf is the wild boar main predator in most of its natural range except in the far east and the lesser sunda islands where it is replaced by the tiger and komodo dragon respectively the wild boar has a long history of association with humans having been the ancestor of most domestic pig breeds and a animal for millennia boars have also in recent decades with feral pigs these hybrids have become a serious pest wild animal in the americas and australia terminology as true wild boars became extinct in great britain before the development of modern english the same terms are often used for both true wild boar and pigs especially large or ones the english stems from the old english bar which is thought to be derived from the west germanic bairaz of unknown origin boar is sometimes used specifically to refer to males and may also be used to refer to male domesticated pigs especially breeding males that have not been castrated the traditional name for a female again comes from old english and germanic it stems from and is related to the latin sus and greek hus and more closely to the new high german sau the young may be called the animals specific name scrofa is latin for hunting in hunting terminology boars are given different designations according to their age taxonomy and evolution mtdna studies indicate that the wild boar originated from islands in southeast asia such as indonesia and the philippines and subsequently spread onto mainland eurasia and north africa the earliest fossil finds of the species come from both europe and asia and date back to the early pleistocene by the late villafranchian s scrofa largely displaced the related s strozzii a large possibly suid ancestral to the modern s verrucosus throughout the eurasian mainland restricting it to insular asia its closest wild relative is the bearded pig of malacca and surrounding islands subspecies as of subspecies are recognised which are divided into four regional groupings western includes s s scrofa s s meridionalis s s algira s s attila s s lybicus and s s nigripes these subspecies are typically though lybicus and some scrofa are with thick underwool and excepting scrofa and attila poorly developed manes indian includes s s davidi and s s cristatus these subspecies have sparse or absent underwool with long manes and prominent bands on the snout and mouth while s s cristatus is s s davidi is eastern includes s s sibiricus s s ussuricus s s leucomystax s s riukiuanus s s taivanus and s s moupinensis these subspecies are characterised by a whitish streak extending from the corners of the mouth to the lower jaw with the exception of s s ussuricus most are the underwool is thick except in s s moupinensis and the mane is largely absent indonesian represented solely by s s vittatus it is characterised by its sparse body hair lack of underwool fairly long mane a broad reddish band extending from the muzzle to the sides of the neck it is the most basal of the four groups having the smallest relative brain size more primitive dentition and unspecialised cranial structure domestication with the exception of domestic pigs in timor and papua new guinea which appear to be of sulawesi warty pig stock the wild boar is the ancestor of most pig breeds archaeological evidence suggests that pigs were domesticated from wild boar as early as bce in the near east in the tigris basin being managed in the wild in a way similar to the way they are managed by some modern new guineans remains of pigs have been dated to earlier than bce in cyprus those animals must have been introduced from the mainland which suggests domestication in the adjacent mainland by then there was also a separate domestication in china which took place about years agodna evidence from remains of teeth and jawbones of neolithic pigs shows that the first domestic pigs in europe had been brought from the near east this stimulated the domestication of local european wild boars resulting in a third domestication event with the near eastern genes dying out in european pig stock modern domesticated pigs have involved complex exchanges with european domesticated lines being exported in turn to the ancient near east historical records indicate that asian pigs were introduced into europe during the and early centuries domestic pigs tend to have much more developed hindquarters than their wild boar ancestors to the point where of their body weight is concentrated in the posterior which is the opposite of wild boar where most of the muscles are concentrated on the head and shoulders physical description the wild boar is a bulky massively built suid with short and relatively thin legs the trunk is short and robust while the hindquarters are comparatively underdeveloped the region behind the shoulder blades rises into a hump and the neck is short and thick to the point of being nearly immobile the animal head is very large taking up to of the body entire length the structure of the head is well suited for digging the head acts as a plough while the powerful neck muscles allow the animal to upturn considerable amounts of soil it is capable of digging cm in into frozen ground and can upturn rocks weighing kg lb the eyes are small and and the ears long and broad the species has well developed canine teeth which protrude from the mouths of adult males the medial hooves are larger and more elongated than the lateral ones and are capable of quick movements the animal can run at a maximum speed of mph and jump at a height of cm in sexual dimorphism is very pronounced in the species with males being typically larger and heavier than females males also sport a mane running down the back which is particularly apparent during autumn and winter the canine teeth are also much more prominent in males and grow throughout life the upper canines are relatively short and grow sideways early in life though they gradually curve upwards the lower canines are much sharper and longer with the exposed parts measuring cm in in length in the breeding period males develop a coating of subcutaneous tissue which may be cm in thick extending from the shoulder blades to the rump thus protecting vital organs during fights males sport a roughly sack near the opening of the penis which collects urine and emits a sharp odour the function of this sack is not fully understood adult size and weight is largely determined by environmental factors boars living in arid areas with little productivity tend to attain smaller sizes than their counterparts inhabiting areas with abundant food and water in most of europe males average kg lb in weight cm in in shoulder height and cm in in body length whereas females average kg lb in weight cm in in shoulder height and cm in in body length in europe mediterranean regions males may reach average weights as low as kg lb and females kg lb with shoulder heights of cm in in the more productive areas of eastern europe males average kg lb in weight cm in in shoulder height and cm in in body length while females weigh kg lb reach cm in in shoulder height and cm in in body length in western and central europe the largest males weigh kg lb and females kg lb in northeastern asia large males can reach brown sizes weighing kg lb and measuring cm in in shoulder height some adult males in ussuriland and manchuria have been recorded to weigh kg lb and measure cm in in shoulder height adults of this size are generally immune from wolf predation such giants are rare in modern times due to past overhunting preventing animals from attaining their full growththe winter coat consists of long coarse bristles underlaid with short brown downy fur the length of these bristles varies along the body with the shortest being around the face and limbs and the longest running along the back these back bristles form the aforementioned mane prominent in males and stand erect when the animal is agitated colour is highly variable specimens around lake balkhash are very lightly coloured and can even be white while some boars from belarus and ussuriland can be black some subspecies sport a patch running backward from the corners of the mouth coat colour also varies with age with piglets having light brown or fur with pale bands extending from the flanks and backthe wild boar produces a number of different sounds which are divided into three categories contact calls grunting noises which differ in intensity according to the situation adult males are usually silent while females frequently grunt and piglets whine when feeding boars express their contentment through purring studies have shown that piglets imitate the sounds of their mother thus different litters may have unique vocalisations alarm calls warning cries emitted in response to threats when frightened boars make loud huffing ukh ukh sounds or emit screeches transcribed as combat calls piercing criesits sense of smell is very well developed to the point that the animal is used for drug detection in germany its hearing is also acute though its eyesight is comparatively weak lacking color vision and being unable to recognise a standing human metres ft away pigs are one of four known mammalian species which possess mutations in the nicotinic acetylcholine receptor that protect against snake venom mongooses honey badgers hedgehogs and pigs all have modifications to the receptor pocket which prevents the snake venom from binding these represent four separate independent mutations social behaviour and life cycle boars are typically social animals living in sounders consisting of barren sows and mothers with young led by an old matriarch male boars leave their sounder at the age of months while females either remain with their mothers or establish new territories nearby subadult males may live in loosely knit groups while adult and elderly males tend to be solitary outside the breeding season the breeding period in most areas lasts from november to january though most mating only lasts a month and a half prior to mating the males develop their subcutaneous armour in preparation for confronting rivals the testicles double in size and the glands secrete a foamy yellowish liquid once ready to reproduce males travel long distances in search of a sounder of sows eating little on the way once a sounder has been located the male drives off all young animals and persistently chases the sows at this point the male fiercely fights potential rivals a single male can mate with sows by the end of the rut males are often badly mauled and have lost of their body weight with injuries to the penis being common the gestation period varies according to the age of the expecting mother for breeders it lasts days while it lasts days in older sows farrowing occurs between march and may with litter sizes depending on the age and nutrition of the mother the average litter consists of piglets with the maximum being the piglets are whelped in a nest constructed from twigs grasses and leaves should the mother die prematurely the piglets are adopted by the other sows in the soundernewborn piglets weigh around grams lacking underfur and bearing a single milk incisor and canine on each half of the jaw there is intense competition between the piglets over the most nipples as the young grow faster and have stronger constitutions the piglets do not leave the lair for their first week of life should the mother be absent the piglets lie closely pressed to each other by two weeks of age the piglets begin accompanying their mother on her journeys should danger be detected the piglets take cover or stand immobile relying on their camouflage to keep them hidden the neonatal coat fades after three months with adult colouration being attained at eight months although the lactation period lasts months the piglets begin displaying adult feeding behaviours at the age of weeks the permanent dentition is fully formed by years with the exception of the canines in males the teeth stop growing during the middle of the fourth year the canines in old males continue to grow throughout their lives curving strongly as they age sows attain sexual maturity at the age of one year with males attaining it a year later however estrus usually first occurs after two years in sows while males begin participating in the rut after years as they are not permitted to mate by the older males the maximum lifespan in the wild is years though few specimens survive past years boars in captivity have lived for years ecology habitat and sheltering behaviour the wild boar inhabits a diverse array of habitats from boreal taigas to deserts in mountainous regions it can even occupy alpine zones occurring up to m ft in the carpathians m ft in the caucasus and up to m ft in the mountains in central asia and kazakhstan in order to survive in a given area wild boars require a habitat fulfilling three conditions heavily brushed areas providing shelter from predators water for drinking and bathing purposes and an absence of regular snowfallthe main habitats favored by boars in europe are deciduous and mixed forests with the most favorable areas consisting of forest composed of oak and beech enclosing marshes and meadows in the bialowieza forest the animal primary habitat consists of and mixed forests along with marshy mixed forests with coniferous forests and undergrowths being of secondary importance forests made up entirely of oak groves and beeches are used only during the season this is in contrast to the caucasian and transcaucasian mountain areas where boars will occupy such forests in the mountainous areas of the russian far east the species inhabits nutpine groves hilly mixed forests where mongolian oak and korean pine are present swampy mixed taiga and coastal oak forests in transbaikalia boars are restricted to river valleys with nut pine and shrubs boars are regularly encountered in pistachio groves in winter in some areas of tajikistan and turkmenistan while in spring they migrate to open deserts boar have also colonized deserts in several areas they have been introduced toon the islands of komodo and rinca the boar mostly inhabits savanna or open monsoon forests avoiding heavily forested areas unless pursued by humans wild boar are known to be competent swimmers capable of covering long distances in one boar was reported to have completed the mi swim from france to alderney in the channel islands due to concerns about disease it was shot and incineratedwild boar rest in shelters which contain insulating material like spruce branches and dry hay these resting places are occupied by whole families though males lie separately and are often located in the vicinity of streams in swamp forests and in tall grass or shrub thickets boars never defecate in their shelters and will cover themselves with soil and pine needles when irritated by insects diet the wild boar is a highly versatile omnivore whose diversity in choice of food is comparable to that of humans their foods can be divided into four categories rhizomes roots tubers and bulbs all of which are dug up throughout the year in the animal whole range nuts berries and seeds which are consumed when ripened and are dug up from the snow when abundant leaves bark twigs and shoots along with garbage earthworms insects mollusks fish rodents insectivores bird eggs lizards snakes frogs and carrion most of these prey items are taken in warm periodsa kg lb boar needs around calories of food per day though this required amount increases during winter and pregnancy with the majority of its diet consisting of food items dug from the ground like underground plant material and burrowing animals acorns and beechnuts are invariably its most important food items in temperate zones as they are rich in the carbohydrates necessary for the buildup of fat reserves needed to survive lean periods in western europe underground plant material favoured by boars includes bracken willow herb bulbs meadow herb roots and bulbs and the bulbs of cultivated crops such food is favoured in early spring and summer but may also be eaten in autumn and winter during beechnut and acorn crop failures should regular wild foods become scarce boars will eat tree bark and fungi as well as visit cultivated potato and artichoke fields boar soil disturbance and foraging have been shown to facilitate invasive plants boars of the vittatus subspecies in ujung kulon national park in java differ from most other populations by their primarily frugivorous diet which consists of different fruit species especially figs thus making them important seed dispersers the wild boar can consume numerous genera of poisonous plants without ill effect including aconitum anemone calla caltha ferula and pteridiumboars may occasionally prey on small vertebrates like newborn deer fawns leporids and galliform chicks boars inhabiting the volga delta and near some lakes and rivers of kazakhstan have been recorded to feed extensively on fish like carp and caspian roach boars in the former area will also feed on cormorant and heron chicks bivalved molluscs trapped muskrats and mice there is at least one record of a boar killing and eating a bonnet macaque in southern india bandipur national park though this may have been a case of intraguild predation brought on by interspecific competition for human handouts predators piglets are vulnerable to attack from felids like eurasian lynx jungle cats and snow leopards and other carnivorans like brown bears and martensthe grey wolf is the main predator of wild boar throughout most of its range a single wolf can kill around to boars of differing ages in one year in italy and belarus belovezhskaya pushcha national park boars are the wolf primary prey despite an abundance of alternative less powerful ungulates wolves are particularly threatening during the winter when deep snow impedes the boars movements in the baltic regions heavy snowfall can allow wolves to eliminate boars from an area almost completely wolves primarily target piglets and subadults and only rarely attack adult sows adult males are usually avoided entirely dholes may also prey on boars to the point of keeping their numbers down in northwestern bhutan despite there being many more cattle in the area leopards are predators of wild boar in the caucasus particularly transcaucasia the russian far east india china and iran in most areas boars constitute only a small part of the leopard diet however in iran sarigol national park boars are the second most frequently targeted prey species after mouflon though adult individuals are generally avoided as they are above the leopard preferred weight range of kg lb this dependence on wild boar is largely due in part to the local leopard subspecies large sizeboars of all ages were once the primary prey of tigers in transcaucasia kazakhstan middle asia and the far east up until the late century in modern times tiger numbers are too low to have a limiting effect on boar populations a single tiger can systematically destroy an entire sounder by preying on its members one by one before moving on to another sounder tigers have been noted to chase boars for longer distances than with other prey in two rare cases boars were reported to gore a small tiger and a tigress to death in in the amur region wild boars are one of the two most important prey species for tigers alongside the manchurian wapiti with the two species collectively comprising roughly of the felid prey in sikhote alin a tiger can kill boars a year studies of tigers in india indicate that boars are usually secondary in preference to various cervids and bovids though when boars are targeted healthy adults are caught more frequently than young and sick specimenson the islands of komodo rinca and flores the boar main predator is the komodo dragon range reconstructed range the species originally occurred in north africa and much of eurasia from the british isles to korea and the sunda islands the northern limit of its range extended from southern scandinavia to southern siberia and japan within this range it was only absent in extremely dry deserts and alpine zones it was once found in north africa along the nile valley up to khartum and north of the sahara the species occurs on a few ionian and aegean islands sometimes swimming between islands the reconstructed northern boundary of the animal asian range ran from lake ladoga at through the area of novgorod and moscow into the southern urals where it reached from there the boundary passed ishim and farther east the irtysh at in the eastern baraba steppe near novosibirsk the boundary turned steep south encircled the altai mountains and went again eastward including the mountains and lake baikal from here the boundary went slightly north of the amur river eastward to its lower reaches at the sea of okhotsk on sakhalin there are only fossil reports of wild boar the southern boundaries in europe and asia were almost invariably identical to the seashores of these continents it is absent in the dry regions of mongolia from southward in china westward of sichuan and in india north of the himalayas it is absent in the higher elevations of the pamir and the tien shan though they do occur in the tarim basin and on the lower slopes of the tien shan present range in recent centuries the range of wild boar has changed dramatically largely due to hunting by humans and more recently because of captive wild boar escaping into the wild prior to the century boar populations had declined in numerous areas with british populations probably becoming extinct during the century in the warm period after the ice age wild boar lived in the southern parts of sweden and norway and north of lake ladoga in karelia it was previously thought that the species did not live in finland during prehistory because no prehistoric wild boar bones had been found within the borders of the country it was not until when a wild boar bone was found in askola that the species was found to have lived in finland more than years ago it is believed however that man prevented its establishment by hunting in denmark the last boar was shot at the beginning of the century and by they were absent in tunisia and sudan and large areas of germany austria and italy in russia they were extirpated in wide areas by the the last boar in egypt reportedly died on december in the giza zoo with wild populations having disappeared by prince kamal el dine hussein attempted to repopulate wadi el natrun with boars of hungarian stock but they were quickly exterminated by poachersa revival of boar populations began in the middle of the century by wild boar had once again reached their original northern boundary in many parts of their asiatic range by they reached leningrad and moscow and by they were to be found in archangelsk and astrakhan in the they again occurred in denmark and sweden where captive animals escaped and now survive in the wild in england wild boar populations themselves in the after escaping from specialist farms that had imported european stock status in great britain wild boars were apparently already becoming rare by the century since a forestry law enacted by william the conqueror punishes through blinding the unlawful killing of a boar charles i attempted to reintroduce the species into the new forest though this population was exterminated during the civil war between their medieval extinction and the when wild boar farming began only a handful of captive wild boar imported from the continent were present in britain occasional escapes of wild boar from wildlife parks have occurred as early as the but since the early significant populations have themselves after escapes from farms the number of which has increased as the demand for meat from the species has grown a maff now defra study on wild boar living wild in britain confirmed the presence of two populations of wild boar living in britain one in sussex and another in dorset another defra report in february confirmed the existence of these two sites as breeding areas and identified a third in in the forest of on wye area a breeding population was also identified in devon there is another significant population in dumfries and galloway populations estimates were as follows the largest population in sussex was then estimated at approximately animals in the core distribution area the smallest in west dorset was estimated to be fewer than animals since winter significant have also resulted in animals colonizing areas around the fringes of dartmoor in devon these are considered as an additional single breeding population and currently estimated to be up to animalspopulation estimates for the forest of dean are disputed as at the time that the defra population estimate was a photo of a boar sounder in the forest near staunton with over animals visible was published and at about the same time over boar were seen in a field near the original escape location of weston under penyard many kilometres or miles away in early the forestry commission embarked on a cull with the aim of reducing the boar population from an estimated animals to by august it was stated that efforts were being made to reduce the population from to but that only had been killed the failure to meet cull targets was confirmed in february boars have crossed the river wye into monmouthshire wales iolo williams the bbc wales wildlife expert attempted to film welsh boar in late many other sightings across the uk have also been reported the effects of wild boar on the uk woodlands were discussed with ralph harmer of the forestry commission on the bbc radio farming today radio programme in the programme prompted activist writer george monbiot to propose a thorough population study followed by the introduction of culling introduction to north america wild boars are an invasive species in the americas and cause problems including native species for food destroying the nests of species killing fawns and young domestic livestock destroying agricultural crops eating tree seeds and seedlings destroying native vegetation and wetlands through wallowing damaging water quality coming into violent conflict with humans and pets and carrying pig and human diseases including brucellosis trichinosis and pseudorabies in some jurisdictions it is illegal to import breed release possess sell distribute trade transport hunt or trap eurasian boars hunting and trapping is done systematically to increase the chance of eradication and to remove the incentive to illegally release boars which have mostly been spread deliberately by sport hunters history while domestic pigs both captive and feral popularly termed razorbacks have been in north america since the earliest days of european colonization pure wild boars were not introduced into the new world until the century the suids were released into the wild by wealthy landowners as big game animals the initial introductions took place in fenced enclosures though several escapes occurred with the escapees sometimes intermixing with already established feral pig populations the first of these introductions occurred in new hampshire in thirteen wild boars from germany were purchased by austin corbin from carl hagenbeck and released into a game preserve in sullivan county several of these boars escaped though they were quickly hunted down by locals two further introductions were made from the original stocking with several escapes taking place due to breaches in the game preserve fencing these escapees have ranged widely with some specimens having been observed crossing into vermontin wild boar from germany were released into a estate in hamilton county new york several specimens escaped six years later dispersing into the william c whitney wilderness area with their descendants surviving for at least yearsthe most extensive boar introduction in the us took place in western north carolina in when boars of undetermined european origin were released into two fenced enclosures in a game preserve in hooper bald graham county most of the specimens remained in the preserve for the next decade until a hunt caused the remaining animals to break through their confines and escape some of the boars migrated to tennessee where they intermixed with both and feral pigs in the area in a dozen hooper bald wild pigs were shipped to california and released in a property between carmel valley and the los padres national forest these hybrid boar were later used as breeding stock on various private and public lands throughout the state as well as in other states like florida georgia south carolina west virginia and mississippiseveral wild boars from leon springs and the san antonio saint louis and san diego zoos were released in the powder horn ranch in calhoun county texas in these specimens escaped and established themselves in surrounding ranchlands and coastal areas with some crossing the espiritu santo bay and colonizing matagorda island descendants of the powder horn ranch boars were later released onto san jose island and the coast of chalmette louisianawild boar of unknown origin were stocked in a ranch in the edwards plateau in the only to escape during a storm and hybridize with local feral pig populations later spreading into neighboring countiesstarting in the several boars purchased from the san diego zoo and tierpark berlin were released into the united states a decade later more specimens from farms in canada and bialowieza forest were let loose in recent years wild pig populations have been reported in states within the us most of which are likely wild hog hybrids pure wild boar populations may still be present but are extremely localized diseases and parasites wild boars are known to host at least different parasitic worm species with maximum infections occurring in summer young animals are vulnerable to helminths like metastrongylus which are consumed by boars through earthworms and cause death by parasitising the lungs wild boar also carry parasites known to infect humans including gastrodiscoides trichinella spiralis taenia solium balantidium coli and toxoplasma gondii wild boar in southern regions are frequently infested with ticks dermacentor rhipicephalus and hyalomma and hog lice the species also suffers from flies which it escapes by bathing frequently or hiding in dense shrubsswine plague spreads very quickly in wild boar with epizootics being recorded in germany poland hungary belarus the caucasus the far east kazakhstan and other regions disease can also take on epidemic proportions in boar populations the species occasionally but rarely contracts pasteurellosis hemorrhagic sepsis tularemia and anthrax wild boar may on occasion contract swine erysipelas through rodents or hog lice and ticks relationships with humans in culture the wild boar features prominently in the cultures of people many of which saw the animal as embodying warrior virtues cultures throughout europe and asia minor saw the killing of a boar as proof of one valor and strength neolithic hunter gatherers depicted reliefs of ferocious wild boars on their temple pillars at gobekli tepe some years ago virtually all heroes in greek mythology fight or kill a boar at one point the demigod herakles third labour involves the capture of the erymanthian boar theseus slays the wild sow phaea and a disguised odysseus is recognised by his handmaiden eurycleia by the scars inflicted on him by a boar during a hunt in his youth to the mythical hyperboreans the boar represented spiritual authority several greek myths use the boar as a symbol of darkness death and winter one example is the story of the youthful adonis who is killed by a boar and is permitted by zeus to depart from hades only during the spring and summer period this theme also occurs in irish and egyptian mythology where the animal is explicitly linked to the month of october therefore autumn this association likely arose from aspects of the boar actual nature its dark colour was linked to the night while its solitary habits proclivity to consume crops and nocturnal nature were associated with evil the foundation myth of ephesus has the city being built over the site where prince androklos of athens killed a boar boars were frequently depicted on greek funerary monuments alongside lions representing gallant losers who have finally met their match as opposed to victorious hunters as lions are the theme of the doomed yet valorous boar warrior also occurred in hittite culture where it was traditional to sacrifice a boar alongside a dog and a prisoner of war after a military defeat the boar as a warrior also appears in scandinavian germanic and culture with its image having been frequently engraved on helmets shields and swords according to tacitus the baltic aesti featured boars on their helmets and may have also worn boar masks see for example the guilden morden boar the boar and pig were held in particularly high esteem by the celts who considered them to be their most important sacred animal some celtic deities linked to boars include moccus and veteris it has been suggested that some early myths surrounding the welsh hero culhwch involved the character being the son of a boar god nevertheless the importance of the boar as a culinary item among celtic tribes may have been exaggerated in popular culture by the asterix series as wild boar bones are rare among celtic archaeological sites and the few that do occur show no signs of butchery having probably been used in sacrificial ritualsthe boar also appears in vedic mythology and hindu mythology a story present in the brahmanas has the god indra slaying an avaricious boar who has stolen the treasure of the asuras then giving its carcass to the god vishnu who offered it as a sacrifice to the gods in the story retelling in the charaka samhita the boar is described as a form of prajapati and is credited with having raised the earth from the primeval waters in the ramayana and the puranas the same boar is portrayed as varaha an avatar of vishnu in japanese culture the boar is widely seen as a fearsome and reckless animal to the point that several words and expressions in japanese referring to recklessness include references to boars the boar is the last animal of the oriental zodiac with people born during the year of the pig being said to embody the traits of determination and impetuosity among japanese hunters the boar courage and defiance is a source of admiration and it is not uncommon for hunters and mountain people to name their sons after the animal inoshishi Zhu  boars are also seen as symbols of fertility and prosperity in some regions it is thought that boars are drawn to fields owned by families including pregnant women and hunters with pregnant wives are thought to have greater chances of success when boar hunting the animal link to prosperity was illustrated by its inclusion on the note during the meiji period and it was once believed that a man could become wealthy by keeping a clump of boar hair in his walletin the folklore of the mongol altai uriankhai tribe the wild boar was associated with the watery underworld as it was thought that the spirits of the dead entered the animal head to be ultimately transported to the water prior to the conversion to islam the kyrgyz people believed that they were descended from boars and thus did not eat pork in buryat mythology the forefathers of the buryats descended from heaven and were nourished by a boar in china the boar is the emblem of the miao peoplethe boar sanglier is frequently displayed in english scottish and welsh heraldry as with the lion the boar is often shown as armed and langued as with the bear scottish and welsh heraldry displays the boar head with the neck cropped unlike the english version which retains the neck the white boar served as the badge of king richard iii of england who distributed it among his northern retainers during his tenure as duke of gloucester as a game animal and food source humans have been hunting boar for millennia the earliest artistic depictions of such activities dating back to the upper paleolithic the animal was seen as a source of food among the ancient greeks as well as a sporting challenge and source of epic narratives the romans inherited this tradition with one of its first practitioners being scipio aemilianus boar hunting became particularly popular among the young nobility during the century bc as preparation for manhood and battle a typical roman boar hunting tactic involved surrounding a given area with large nets then flushing the boar with dogs and immobilizing it with smaller nets the animal would then be dispatched with a venabulum a short spear with a crossguard at the base of the blade more than their greek predecessors the romans extensively took inspiration from boar hunting in their art and sculpture with the ascension of constantine the great boar hunting took on christian allegorical themes with the animal being portrayed as a black beast analogous to the dragon of saint george boar hunting continued after the fall of the western roman empire though the germanic tribes considered the red deer to be a more noble and worthy quarry the nobility hunted boar as their predecessors did but primarily as training for battle rather than sport it was not uncommon for medieval hunters to deliberately hunt boars during the breeding season when the animals were more aggressive during the renaissance when deforestation and the introduction of firearms reduced boar numbers boar hunting became the sole prerogative of the nobility one of many charges brought up against the rich during the german peasants war and the french revolution during the century boars were caught in the caucasus in kazakhstan and about in central asia during the soviet period primarily through the use of dogs and beats in nepal farmers and poachers eliminate boars by baiting balls of wheat flour containing explosives with kerosene oil with the animals chewing motions triggering the deviceswild boar can thrive in captivity though piglets grow slowly and poorly without their mothers products derived from wild boar include meat hide and bristles apicius devotes a whole chapter to the cooking of boar meat providing recipes involving roasting boiling and what sauces to use the romans usually served boar meat with garum boar head was the centrepiece of most medieval christmas celebrations among the nobility although growing in popularity as a source of food the wild boar takes longer to mature than most domestic pigs and it is usually smaller and produces less meat nevertheless wild boar meat is leaner and healthier than pork being of higher nutritional value and having a much higher concentration of essential amino acids most organizations agree that a boar carcass should yield kg lb of meat on average large specimens can yield kg lb of fat with some giants yielding kg lb or more a boar hide can measure sq in and can yield grams oz of bristle and grams oz of underwool crop and garbage raiding boars can be damaging to agriculture in situations where their natural habitat is sparse populations living on the outskirts of towns or farms can dig up potatoes and damage melons watermelons and maize however they generally only encroach upon farms when natural food is scarce in the belovezh forest for example of the local boar population will enter fields in years of moderate availability of natural foods while the role of boars in damaging crops is often exaggerated cases are known of boar depredations causing famines as was the case in hachinohe japan in where people died of what became known as the wild boar famine still within japanese culture the boar status as vermin is expressed through its title as king of pests and the popular saying addressed to young men in rural areas when you get married choose a place with no wild boar in central europe farmers typically repel boars through distraction or fright while in kazakhstan it is usual to employ guard dogs in plantations although large boar populations can play an important role in limiting forest growth they are also useful in keeping pest populations such as june bugs under control the growth of urban areas and the corresponding decline in natural boar habitats has led to some sounders entering human habitations in search of food as in natural conditions sounders in areas are matriarchal though males tend to be much less represented and adults of both sexes can be up to heavier than their counterparts as of at least
