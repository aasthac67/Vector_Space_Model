ants are eusocial insects of the family formicidae and along with the related wasps and bees belong to the order hymenoptera ants appear in the fossil record across the globe in considerable diversity during the latest early cretaceous and early late cretaceous suggesting an earlier origin ants evolved from vespoid wasp ancestors in the cretaceous period and diversified after the rise of flowering plants more than of an estimated total of species have been classified they are easily identified by their elbowed antennae and the distinctive structure that forms their slender waists ants form colonies that range in size from a few dozen predatory individuals living in small natural cavities to highly organised colonies that may occupy large territories and consist of millions of individuals larger colonies consist of various castes of sterile wingless females most of which are workers ergates as well as soldiers dinergates and other specialised groups nearly all ant colonies also have some fertile males called drones aner and one or more fertile females called queens gynes the colonies are described as superorganisms because the ants appear to operate as a unified entity collectively working together to support the colony ants have colonised almost every landmass on earth the only places lacking indigenous ants are antarctica and a few remote or inhospitable islands ants thrive in most ecosystems and may form of the terrestrial animal biomass their success in so many environments has been attributed to their social organisation and their ability to modify habitats tap resources and defend themselves their long with other species has led to mimetic commensal parasitic and mutualistic relationships ant societies have division of labour communication between individuals and an ability to solve complex problems these parallels with human societies have long been an inspiration and subject of study many human cultures make use of ants in cuisine medication and rituals some species are valued in their role as biological pest control agents their ability to exploit resources may bring ants into conflict with humans however as they can damage crops and invade buildings some species such as the red imported fire ant solenopsis invicta are regarded as invasive species establishing themselves in areas where they have been introduced accidentally etymology the word ant and its chiefly dialectal form emmet come from ante emete of middle english which come from aemette of old english and these are all related to the dialectal dutch emt and the old high german ameiza from which comes the modern german ameise all of these words come from west germanic aemaitjon and the original meaning of the word was the biter from off away cut the family name formicidae is derived from the latin formica ant from which the words in other romance languages such as the portuguese formiga italian formica spanish hormiga romanian furnica and french fourmi are derived it has been hypothesised that a word was used cf sanskrit vamrah greek murmex myrmex old church slavonic mraviji old irish moirb old norse maurr dutch mier swedish myra danish myre middle dutch miere crimean gothic miera taxonomy and evolution the family formicidae belongs to the order hymenoptera which also includes sawflies bees and wasps ants evolved from a lineage within the stinging wasps and a study suggests that they are a sister group of the apoidea in e o wilson and his colleagues identified the fossil remains of an ant sphecomyrma that lived in the cretaceous period the specimen trapped in amber dating back to around million years ago has features found in some wasps but not found in modern ants sphecomyrma was possibly a ground forager while haidomyrmex and haidomyrmodes related genera in subfamily sphecomyrminae are reconstructed as active arboreal predators older ants in the genus sphecomyrmodes have been found in million amber from myanmar a study suggested that ants arose tens of millions of years earlier than previously thought up to million years ago after the rise of flowering plants about million years ago they diversified and assumed ecological dominance around million years ago some groups such as the leptanillinae and martialinae are suggested to have diversified from early primitive ants that were likely to have been predators underneath the surface of the soil during the cretaceous period a few species of primitive ants ranged widely on the laurasian supercontinent the northern hemisphere they were scarce in comparison to the populations of other insects representing only about of the entire insect population ants became dominant after adaptive radiation at the beginning of the paleogene period by the oligocene and miocene ants had come to represent of all insects found in major fossil deposits of the species that lived in the eocene epoch around one in genera survive to the present genera surviving today comprise of the genera in baltic amber fossils early oligocene and of the genera in dominican amber fossils apparently early miocene termites live in colonies and are sometimes called white ants but termites are not ants they are the isoptera and together with cockroaches they form the order blattodea blattodeans are related to mantids crickets and other winged insects that do not undergo full metamorphosis like ants termites are eusocial with sterile workers but they differ greatly in the genetics of reproduction the similarity of their social structure to that of ants is attributed to convergent evolution velvet ants look like large ants but are wingless female wasps distribution and diversity ants are found on all continents except antarctica and only a few large islands such as greenland iceland parts of polynesia and the hawaiian islands lack native ant species ants occupy a wide range of ecological niches and exploit many different food resources as direct or indirect herbivores predators and scavengers most ant species are omnivorous generalists but a few are specialist feeders their ecological dominance is demonstrated by their biomass ants are estimated to contribute on average and nearly in the tropics of terrestrial animal biomass exceeding that of the vertebratesants range in size from to millimetres in the largest species being the fossil titanomyrma giganteum the queen of which was centimetres in long with a wingspan of centimetres in ants vary in colour most ants are red or black but a few species are green and some tropical species have a metallic lustre more than species are currently known with upper estimates of the potential existence of about see the article list of ant genera with the greatest diversity in the tropics taxonomic studies continue to resolve the classification and systematics of ants online databases of ant species including antbase and the hymenoptera name server help to keep track of the known and newly described species the relative ease with which ants may be sampled and studied in ecosystems has made them useful as indicator species in biodiversity studies morphology ants are distinct in their morphology from other insects in having elbowed antennae metapleural glands and a strong constriction of their second abdominal segment into a petiole the head mesosoma and metasoma are the three distinct body segments formally tagmata the petiole forms a narrow waist between their mesosoma thorax plus the first abdominal segment which is fused to it and gaster abdomen less the abdominal segments in the petiole the petiole may be formed by one or two nodes the second alone or the second and third abdominal segments like other insects ants have an exoskeleton an external covering that provides a protective casing around the body and a point of attachment for muscles in contrast to the internal skeletons of humans and other vertebrates insects do not have lungs oxygen and other gases such as carbon dioxide pass through their exoskeleton via tiny valves called spiracles insects also lack closed blood vessels instead they have a long thin perforated tube along the top of the body called the dorsal aorta that functions like a heart and pumps haemolymph toward the head thus driving the circulation of the internal fluids the nervous system consists of a ventral nerve cord that runs the length of the body with several ganglia and branches along the way reaching into the extremities of the appendages head an ant head contains many sensory organs like most insects ants have compound eyes made from numerous tiny lenses attached together ant eyes are good for acute movement detection but do not offer a high resolution image they also have three small ocelli simple eyes on the top of the head that detect light levels and polarization compared to vertebrates ants tend to have blurrier eyesight particularly in smaller species and a few subterranean taxa are completely blind however some ants such as australia bulldog ant have excellent vision and are capable of discriminating the distance and size of objects moving nearly a metre awaytwo antennae feelers are attached to the head these organs detect chemicals air currents and vibrations they also are used to transmit and receive signals through touch the head has two strong jaws the mandibles used to carry food manipulate objects construct nests and for defence in some species a small pocket infrabuccal chamber inside the mouth stores food so it may be passed to other ants or their larvae mesosoma both the legs and wings of the ant are attached to the mesosoma thorax the legs terminate in a hooked claw which allows them to hook on and climb surfaces only reproductive ants queens and males have wings queens shed their wings after the nuptial flight leaving visible stubs a distinguishing feature of queens in a few species wingless queens ergatoids and males occur metasoma the metasoma the abdomen of the ant houses important internal organs including those of the reproductive respiratory tracheae and excretory systems workers of many species have their structures modified into stings that are used for subduing prey and defending their nests polymorphism in the colonies of a few ant species there are physical in distinct called minor median and major ergates often the larger ants have disproportionately larger heads and correspondingly stronger mandibles these are known as macrergates while smaller workers are known as micrergates although formally known as dinergates such individuals are sometimes called soldier ants because their stronger mandibles make them more effective in fighting although they still are workers and their duties typically do not vary greatly from the minor or median workers in a few species the median workers are absent creating a sharp divide between the minors and majors weaver ants for example have a distinct bimodal size distribution some other species show continuous variation in the size of workers the smallest and largest workers in pheidologeton diversus show nearly a difference in their can not mate however because of the haplodiploid system in ants workers of a number of species can lay unfertilised eggs that become fully fertile haploid males the role of workers may change with their age and in some species such as honeypot ants young workers are fed until their gasters are distended and act as living food storage vessels these food storage workers are called repletes for instance these replete workers develop in the north american honeypot ant myrmecocystus mexicanus usually the largest workers in the colony develop into repletes and if repletes are removed from the colony other workers become repletes demonstrating the flexibility of this particular polymorphism this polymorphism in morphology and behaviour of workers initially was thought to be determined by environmental factors such as nutrition and hormones that led to different developmental paths however genetic differences between worker castes have been noted in acromyrmex sp these polymorphisms are caused by relatively small genetic changes differences in a single gene of solenopsis invicta can decide whether the colony will have single or multiple queens the australian jack jumper ant myrmecia pilosula has only a single pair of chromosomes with the males having just one chromosome as they are haploid the lowest number known for any animal making it an interesting subject for studies in the genetics and developmental biology of social insects life cycle the life of an ant starts from an egg if the egg is fertilised the progeny will be female diploid if not it will be male haploid ants develop by complete metamorphosis with the larva stages passing through a pupal stage before emerging as an adult the larva is largely immobile and is fed and cared for by workers food is given to the larvae by trophallaxis a process in which an ant regurgitates liquid food held in its crop this is also how adults share food stored in the social stomach larvae especially in the later stages may also be provided solid food such as trophic eggs pieces of prey and seeds brought by workersthe larvae grow through a series of four or five moults and enter the pupal stage the pupa has the appendages free and not fused to the body as in a butterfly pupa the differentiation into queens and workers which are both female and different castes of workers is influenced in some species by the nutrition the larvae obtain genetic influences and the control of gene expression by the developmental environment are complex and the determination of caste continues to be a subject of research winged male ants called drones emerge from pupae along with the usually winged breeding females some species such as army ants have wingless queens larvae and pupae need to be kept at fairly constant temperatures to ensure proper development and so often are moved around among the various brood chambers within the colonya new ergate spends the first few days of its adult life caring for the queen and young she then graduates to digging and other nest work and later to defending the nest and foraging these changes are sometimes fairly sudden and define what are called temporal castes an explanation for the sequence is suggested by the high casualties involved in foraging making it an acceptable risk only for ants who are older and are likely to die soon of natural causesant colonies can be the queens can live for up to years and workers live from to years males however are more transitory being quite and surviving for only a few weeks ant queens are estimated to live times as long as solitary insects of a similar sizeants are active all year long in the tropics but in cooler regions they survive the winter in a state of dormancy known as hibernation the forms of inactivity are varied and some temperate species have larvae going into the inactive state diapause while in others the adults alone pass the winter in a state of reduced activity reproduction a wide range of reproductive strategies have been noted in ant species females of many species are known to be capable of reproducing asexually through thelytokous parthenogenesis secretions from the male accessory glands in some species can plug the female genital opening and prevent females from most ant species have a system in which only the queen and breeding females have the ability to mate contrary to popular belief some ant nests have multiple queens while others may exist without queens workers with the ability to reproduce are called gamergates and colonies that lack queens are then called gamergate colonies colonies with queens are said to be can also mate with existing queens by entering a foreign colony when the drone is initially attacked by the workers it releases a mating pheromone if recognized as a mate it will be carried to the queen to mate males may also patrol the nest and fight others by grabbing them with their mandibles piercing their exoskeleton and then marking them with a pheromone the marked male is interpreted as an invader by worker ants and is killed most ants are univoltine producing a new generation each year during the breeding period winged females and winged males known to entomologists as alates leave the colony in what is called a nuptial flight the nuptial flight usually takes place in the late spring or early summer when the weather is hot and humid heat makes flying easier and freshly fallen rain makes the ground softer for mated queens to dig nests males typically take flight before the females males then use visual cues to find a common mating ground for example a landmark such as a pine tree to which other males in the area converge males secrete a mating pheromone that females follow males will mount females in the air but the actual mating process usually takes place on the ground females of some species mate with just one male but in others they may mate with as many as ten or more different males storing the sperm in their spermathecaemated females then seek a suitable place to begin a colony there they break off their wings and begin to lay and care for eggs the females can selectively fertilise future eggs with the sperm stored to produce diploid workers or lay unfertilized haploid eggs to produce drones the first workers to hatch are known as nanitics and are weaker and smaller than later workers but they begin to serve the colony immediately they enlarge the nest forage for food and care for the other eggs species that have multiple queens may have a queen leaving the nest along with some workers to found a colony at a new site a process akin to swarming in honeybees behaviour and ecology communication ants communicate with each other using pheromones sounds and touch the use of pheromones as chemical signals is more developed in ants such as the red harvester ant than in other hymenopteran groups like other insects ants perceive smells with their long thin and mobile antennae the paired antennae provide information about the direction and intensity of scents since most ants live on the ground they use the soil surface to leave pheromone trails that may be followed by other ants in species that forage in groups a forager that finds food marks a trail on the way back to the colony this trail is followed by other ants these ants then reinforce the trail when they head back with food to the colony when the food source is exhausted no new trails are marked by returning ants and the scent slowly dissipates this behaviour helps ants deal with changes in their environment for instance when an established path to a food source is blocked by an obstacle the foragers leave the path to explore new routes if an ant is successful it leaves a new trail marking the shortest route on its return successful trails are followed by more ants reinforcing better routes and gradually identifying the best pathants use pheromones for more than just making trails a crushed ant emits an alarm pheromone that sends nearby ants into an attack frenzy and attracts more ants from farther away several ant species even use propaganda pheromones to confuse enemy ants and make them fight among themselves pheromones are produced by a wide range of structures including dufour glands poison glands and glands on the hindgut pygidium rectum sternum and hind tibia pheromones also are exchanged mixed with food and passed by trophallaxis transferring information within the colony this allows other ants to detect what task group eg foraging or nest maintenance other colony members belong to in ant species with queen castes when the dominant queen stops producing a specific pheromone workers begin to raise new queens in the colonysome ants produce sounds by stridulation using the gaster segments and their mandibles sounds may be used to communicate with colony members or with other species defence ants attack and defend themselves by biting and in many species by stinging often injecting or spraying chemicals such as formic acid in the case of formicine ants alkaloids and piperidines in fire ants and a variety of protein components in other ants bullet ants paraponera located in central and south america are considered to have the most painful sting of any insect although it is usually not fatal to humans this sting is given the highest rating on the schmidt sting pain indexthe sting of jack jumper ants can be fatal and an antivenom has been developed for itfire ants solenopsis spp are unique in having a venom sac containing piperidine alkaloids their stings are painful and can be dangerous to hypersensitive people ants of the genus odontomachus are equipped with mandibles called which snap shut faster than any other predatory appendages within the animal kingdom one study of odontomachus bauri recorded peak speeds of between and and mph with the jaws closing within microseconds on average the ants were also observed to use their jaws as a catapult to eject intruders or fling themselves backward to escape a threat before striking the ant opens its mandibles extremely widely and locks them in this position by an internal mechanism energy is stored in a thick band of muscle and explosively released when triggered by the stimulation of sensory organs resembling hairs on the inside of the mandibles the mandibles also permit slow and fine movements for other tasks also are seen in the following genera anochetus orectognathus and strumigenys plus some members of the dacetini tribe which are viewed as examples of convergent evolution a malaysian species of ant in the camponotus cylindricus group has enlarged mandibular glands that extend into their gaster if combat takes a turn for the worse a worker may perform a final act of suicidal altruism by rupturing the membrane of its gaster causing the content of its mandibular glands to burst from the anterior region of its head spraying a poisonous corrosive secretion containing acetophenones and other chemicals that immobilise small insect attackers the worker subsequently diessuicidal defences by workers are also noted in a brazilian ant forelius pusillus where a small group of ants leaves the security of the nest after sealing the entrance from the outside each evening in addition to defence against predators ants need to protect their colonies from pathogens some worker ants maintain the hygiene of the colony and their activities include undertaking or necrophory the disposal of dead oleic acid has been identified as the compound released from dead ants that triggers necrophoric behaviour in atta mexicana while workers of linepithema humile react to the absence of characteristic chemicals dolichodial and iridomyrmecin present on the cuticle of their living nestmates to trigger similar behaviournests may be protected from physical threats such as flooding and overheating by elaborate nest architecture workers of cataulacus muticus an arboreal species that lives in plant hollows respond to flooding by drinking water inside the nest and excreting it outside camponotus anderseni which nests in the cavities of wood in mangrove habitats deals with submergence under water by switching to anaerobic respiration learning many animals can learn behaviours by imitation but ants may be the only group apart from mammals where interactive teaching has been observed a knowledgeable forager of temnothorax albipennis can lead a naive to newly discovered food by the process of tandem running the follower obtains knowledge through its leading tutor the leader is acutely sensitive to the progress of the follower and slows down when the follower lags and speeds up when the follower gets too closecontrolled experiments with colonies of cerapachys biroi suggest that an individual may choose nest roles based on her previous experience an entire generation of identical workers was divided into two groups whose outcome in food foraging was controlled one group was continually rewarded with prey while it was made certain that the other failed as a result members of the successful group intensified their foraging attempts while the unsuccessful group ventured out fewer and fewer times a month later the successful foragers continued in their role while the others had moved to specialise in brood care nest construction complex nests are built by many ant species but other species are nomadic and do not build permanent structures ants may form subterranean nests or build them on trees these nests may be found in the ground under stones or logs inside logs hollow stems or even acorns the materials used for construction include soil and plant matter and ants carefully select their nest sites temnothorax albipennis will avoid sites with dead ants as these may indicate the presence of pests or disease they are quick to abandon established nests at the first sign of threatsthe army ants of south america such as the eciton burchellii species and the driver ants of africa do not build permanent nests but instead alternate between nomadism and stages where the workers form a temporary nest bivouac from their own bodies by holding each other togetherweaver ant oecophylla spp workers build nests in trees by attaching leaves together first pulling them together with bridges of workers and then inducing their larvae to produce silk as they are moved along the leaf edges similar forms of nest construction are seen in some species of polyrhachisformica polyctena among other ant species constructs nests that maintain a relatively constant interior temperature that aids in the development of larvae the ants maintain the nest temperature by choosing the location nest materials controlling ventilation and maintaining the heat from solar radiation worker activity and metabolism and in some moist nests microbial activity in the nest materialssome ant species such as those that use natural cavities can be opportunistic and make use of the controlled provided inside human dwellings and other artificial structures to house their colonies and nest structures ant bridge cultivation of food most ants are generalist predators scavengers and indirect herbivores but a few have evolved specialised ways of obtaining nutrition it is believed that many ant species that engage in indirect herbivory rely on specialized symbiosis with their gut microbes to upgrade the nutritional value of the food they collect and allow them to survive in nitrogen poor regions such as rainforest canopies leafcutter ants atta and acromyrmex feed exclusively on a fungus that grows only within their colonies they continually collect leaves which are taken to the colony cut into tiny pieces and placed in fungal gardens ergates specialise in related tasks according to their sizes the largest ants cut stalks smaller workers chew the leaves and the smallest tend the fungus leafcutter ants are sensitive enough to recognise the reaction of the fungus to different plant material apparently detecting chemical signals from the fungus if a particular type of leaf is found to be toxic to the fungus the colony will no longer collect it the ants feed on structures produced by the fungi called gongylidia symbiotic bacteria on the exterior surface of the ants produce antibiotics that kill bacteria introduced into the nest that may harm the fungi navigation foraging ants travel distances of up to metres ft from their nest and scent trails allow them to find their way back even in the dark in hot and arid regions ants face death by desiccation so the ability to find the shortest route back to the nest reduces that risk diurnal desert ants of the genus cataglyphis such as the sahara desert ant navigate by keeping track of direction as well as distance travelled distances travelled are measured using an internal pedometer that keeps count of the steps taken and also by evaluating the movement of objects in their visual field optical flow directions are measured using the position of the sun they integrate this information to find the shortest route back to their nest like all ants they can also make use of visual landmarks when available as well as olfactory and tactile cues to navigate some species of ant are able to use the earth magnetic field for navigation the compound eyes of ants have specialised cells that detect polarised light from the sun which is used to determine direction these polarization detectors are sensitive in the ultraviolet region of the light spectrum in some army ant species a group of foragers who become separated from the main column may sometimes turn back on themselves and form a circular ant mill the workers may then run around continuously until they die of exhaustion locomotion the female worker ants do not have wings and reproductive females lose their wings after their mating flights in order to begin their colonies therefore unlike their wasp ancestors most ants travel by walking some species are capable of leaping for example jerdon jumping ant harpegnathos saltator is able to jump by synchronising the action of its mid and hind pairs of legs there are several species of gliding ant including cephalotes atratus this may be a common trait among arboreal ants with small colonies ants with this ability are able to control their horizontal movement so as to catch tree trunks when they fall from atop the forest canopyother species of ants can form chains to bridge gaps over water underground or through spaces in vegetation some species also form floating rafts that help them survive floods these rafts may also have a role in allowing ants to colonise islands polyrhachis sokolova a species of ant found in australian mangrove swamps can swim and live in underwater nests since they lack gills they go to trapped pockets of air in the submerged nests to breathe cooperation and competition not all ants have the same kind of societies the australian bulldog ants are among the biggest and most basal of ants like virtually all ants they are eusocial but their social behaviour is poorly developed compared to other species each individual hunts alone using her large eyes instead of chemical senses to find preysome species such as tetramorium caespitum attack and take over neighbouring ant colonies others are less expansionist but just as aggressive they invade colonies to steal eggs or larvae which they either eat or raise as workers or slaves extreme specialists among these ants such as the amazon ants are incapable of feeding themselves and need captured workers to survive captured workers of enslaved temnothorax species have evolved a counter strategy destroying just the female pupae of the temnothorax americanus but sparing the males who do take part in as adults ants identify kin and nestmates through their scent which comes from secretions that coat their exoskeletons if an ant is separated from its original colony it will eventually lose the colony scent any ant that enters a colony without a matching scent will be attacked also the reason why two separate colonies of ants will attack each other even if they are of the same species is because the genes responsible for pheromone production are different between them the argentine ant however does not have this characteristic due to lack of genetic diversity and has become a global pest because of it parasitic ant species enter the colonies of host ants and establish themselves as social parasites species such as strumigenys xenos are entirely parasitic and do not have workers but instead rely on the food gathered by their strumigenys perplexa hosts this form of parasitism is seen across many ant genera but the parasitic ant is usually a species that is closely related to its host a variety of methods are employed to enter the nest of the host ant a parasitic queen may enter the host nest before the first brood has hatched establishing herself prior to development of a colony scent other species use pheromones to confuse the host ants or to trick them into carrying the parasitic queen into the nest some simply fight their way into the nesta conflict between the sexes of a species is seen in some species of ants with these reproducers apparently competing to produce offspring that are as closely related to them as possible the most extreme form involves the production of clonal offspring an extreme of sexual conflict is seen in wasmannia auropunctata where the queens produce diploid daughters by thelytokous parthenogenesis and males produce clones by a process whereby a diploid egg loses its maternal contribution to produce haploid males who are clones of the father relationships with other organisms ants form symbiotic associations with a range of species including other ant species other insects plants and fungi they also are preyed on by many animals and even certain fungi some arthropod species spend part of their lives within ant nests either preying on ants their larvae and eggs consuming the food stores of the ants or avoiding predators these inquilines may bear a close resemblance to ants the nature of this ant mimicry myrmecomorphy varies with some cases involving batesian mimicry where the mimic reduces the risk of predation others show wasmannian mimicry a form of mimicry seen only in inquilines aphids and other hemipteran insects secrete a sweet liquid called honeydew when they feed on plant sap the sugars in honeydew are a food source which many ant species collect in some cases the aphids secrete the honeydew in response to ants tapping them with their antennae the ants in turn keep predators away from the aphids and will move them from one feeding location to another when migrating to a new area many colonies will take the aphids with them to ensure a continued supply of honeydew ants also tend mealybugs to harvest their honeydew mealybugs may become a serious pest of pineapples if ants are present to protect mealybugs from their natural enemiesmyrmecophilous caterpillars of the butterfly family lycaenidae eg blues coppers or hairstreaks are herded by the ants led to feeding areas in the daytime and brought inside the ants nest at night the caterpillars have a gland which secretes honeydew when the ants massage them some caterpillars produce vibrations and sounds that are perceived by the ants a similar adaptation can be seen in grizzled skipper butterflies that emit vibrations by expanding their wings in order to communicate with ants which are natural predators of these butterflies other caterpillars have evolved from to these myrmecophagous caterpillars secrete a pheromone that makes the ants act as if the caterpillar is one of their own larvae the caterpillar is then taken into the ant nest where it feeds on the ant larvae a number of specialized bacteria have been found as endosymbionts in ant guts some of the dominant bacteria belong to the order rhizobiales whose members are known for being symbionts in legumes but the species found in ant lack the ability to fix nitrogen ants that make up the tribe attini including leafcutter ants cultivate certain species of fungus in the genera leucoagaricus or leucocoprinus of the family agaricaceae in this mutualism both species depend on each other for survival the ant allomerus decemarticulatus has evolved a association with the host plant hirtella physophora chrysobalanaceae and a sticky fungus which is used to trap their insect prey lemon ants make devil gardens by killing surrounding plants with their stings and leaving a pure patch of lemon ant trees duroia hirsuta this modification of the forest provides the ants with more nesting sites inside the stems of the duroia trees although some ants obtain nectar from flowers pollination by ants is somewhat rare one example being of the pollination of the orchid leporella fimbriata which induces male myrmecia urens to pseudocopulate with the flowers transferring pollen in the process one theory that has been proposed for the rarity of pollination is that the secretions of the metapleural gland inactivate and reduce the viability of pollen some plants have special nectar exuding structures extrafloral nectaries that provide food for ants which in turn protect the plant from more damaging herbivorous insects species such as the bullhorn acacia acacia cornigera in central america have hollow thorns that house colonies of stinging ants pseudomyrmex ferruginea who defend the tree against insects browsing mammals and epiphytic vines isotopic labelling studies suggest that plants also obtain nitrogen from the ants in return the ants obtain food from and beltian bodies in fiji philidris nagasau dolichoderinae are known to selectively grow species of epiphytic squamellaria rubiaceae which produce large domatia inside which the ant colonies nest the ants plant the seeds and the domatia of young seedling are immediately occupied and the ant faeces in them contribute to rapid growth similar dispersal associations are found with other dolichoderines in the region as well another example of this type of ectosymbiosis comes from the macaranga tree which has stems adapted to house colonies of crematogaster antsmany plant species have seeds that are adapted for dispersal by ants seed dispersal by ants or myrmecochory is widespread and new estimates suggest that nearly of all plant species may have such ant associations often ants perform directed dispersal depositing the seeds in locations that increase the likelihood of seed survival to reproduction some plants in arid systems are particularly dependent on ants for their survival and dispersal as the seeds are transported to safety below the ground many seeds have special external structures elaiosomes that are sought after by ants as fooda convergence possibly a form of mimicry is seen in the eggs of stick insects they have an edible structure and are taken into the ant nest where the young hatch most ants are predatory and some prey on and obtain food from other social insects including other ants some species specialise in preying on termites megaponera and termitopone while a few cerapachyinae prey on other ants some termites including nasutitermes corniger form associations with certain ant species to keep away predatory ant species the tropical wasp mischocyttarus drewseni coats the pedicel of its nest with an chemical it is suggested that many tropical wasps may build their nests in trees and cover them to protect themselves from ants other wasps such as a multipicta defend against ants by blasting them off the nest with bursts of wing buzzing stingless bees trigona and melipona use chemical defences against antsflies in the old world genus bengalia calliphoridae prey on ants and are kleptoparasites snatching prey or brood from the mandibles of adult ants wingless and legless females of the malaysian phorid fly vestigipoda myrmolarvoidea live in the nests of ants of the genus aenictus and are cared for by the antsfungi in the genera cordyceps and ophiocordyceps infect ants ants react to their infection by climbing up plants and sinking their mandibles into plant tissue the fungus kills the ants grows on their remains and produces a fruiting body it appears that the fungus alters the behaviour of the ant to help disperse its spores in a microhabitat that best suits the fungus strepsipteran parasites also manipulate their ant host to climb grass stems to help the parasite find matesa nematode myrmeconema neotropicum that infects canopy ants cephalotes atratus causes the gasters of workers to turn red the parasite also alters the behaviour of the ant causing them to carry their gasters high the conspicuous red gasters are mistaken by birds for ripe fruits such as hyeronima alchorneoides and eaten the droppings of the bird are collected by other ants and fed to their young leading to further spread of the nematode south american poison dart frogs in the genus dendrobates feed mainly on ants and the toxins in their skin may come from the antsarmy ants forage in a wide roving column attacking any animals in that path that are unable to escape in central and south america eciton burchellii is the swarming ant most commonly attended by birds such as antbirds and woodcreepers this behaviour was once considered mutualistic but later studies found the birds to be parasitic direct kleptoparasitism birds stealing food from the ants grasp is rare and has been noted in inca doves which pick seeds at nest entrances as they are being transported by species of pogonomyrmex birds that follow ants eat many prey insects and thus decrease the foraging success of ants birds indulge in a peculiar behaviour called anting that as yet is not fully understood here birds rest on ant nests or pick and drop ants onto their wings and feathers this may be a means to remove ectoparasites from the birds anteaters aardvarks pangolins echidnas and numbats have special adaptations for living on a diet of ants these adaptations include long sticky tongues to capture ants and strong claws to break into ant nests brown bears ursus arctos have been found to feed on ants about and of their faecal volume in spring summer and autumn respectively is composed of ants relationship with humans ants perform many ecological roles that are beneficial to humans including the suppression of pest populations and aeration of the soil the use of weaver ants in citrus cultivation in southern china is considered one of the oldest known applications of biological control on the other hand ants may become nuisances when they invade buildings or cause economic losses in some parts of the world mainly africa and south america large ants especially army ants are used as surgical sutures the wound is pressed together and ants are applied along it the ant seizes the edges of the wound in its mandibles and locks in place the body is then cut off and the head and mandibles remain in place to close the wound the large

linearis a plant used to make a herbal tea the plant disperses its seeds widely making manual collection difficult black ants collect and store these and other seeds in their nest where humans can gather them en masse up to half a pound g of seeds may be collected from one most ants survive attempts by humans to eradicate them a few are highly endangered these tend to be island species that have evolved specialized traits and risk being displaced by introduced ant species examples include the critically endangered sri lankan relict ant aneuretus simoni and adetomyrma venatrix of madagascarit has been estimated by e o wilson that the total number of individual ants alive in the world at any one time is between one and ten quadrillion short scale ie between and according to this estimate the total biomass of all the ants in the world is approximately equal to the total biomass of the entire human race according to this estimate there are also approximately million ants for every human on earth as food ants and their larvae are eaten in different parts of the world the eggs of two species of ants are used in mexican escamoles they are considered a form of insect caviar and can sell for as much as us per pound because they are seasonal and hard to find in the colombian department of santander hormigas culonas roughly interpreted as ants atta laevigata are

wrote beauty in the case of the green ant is more than their attractive almost translucency possibly invited the first essays at their consumption by the human species mashed up in water after the manner of lemon squash these ants form a pleasant acid drink which is held in high favor by the natives of north queensland and is even appreciated by many european palates in his first summer in the sierra john muir notes that the digger indians of california ate the tickling acid gasters of the large carpenter ants the mexican indians eat the replete workers or living of the honey ant myrmecocystus as pests some ant species are considered as pests primarily those that occur in human habitations where their presence is often problematic for example the presence of ants would be undesirable in sterile places such as hospitals or kitchens some species or genera commonly categorized as pests include the argentine ant pavement ant yellow crazy ant banded sugar ant pharaoh ant red ant carpenter ant odorous house ant red imported fire ant and european fire ant some ants will raid stored food some will seek water sources others may damage indoor structures some may damage agricultural crops directly or by aiding sucking pests some will sting or bite the adaptive nature of ant colonies make it nearly impossible to eliminate entire colonies and most pest management practices aim to control local populations and tend to be temporary solutions ant populations are managed by a combination of approaches that make use of chemical biological and physical methods chemical methods include the use of insecticidal bait which is gathered by ants as food and brought back to the nest where the poison is inadvertently spread to other colony members through trophallaxis management is based on the species and techniques may vary according to the location and circumstance in science and technology observed by humans since the dawn of history the behaviour of ants has been documented and the subject of early writings and fables passed from one century to another those using scientific methods myrmecologists study ants in the laboratory and in their natural conditions their complex and variable social structures have made ants ideal model organisms ultraviolet vision was first discovered in ants by sir john lubbock in studies on ants have tested hypotheses in ecology and sociobiology and have been particularly important in examining the predictions of theories of kin selection and evolutionarily stable strategies ant colonies may be studied by rearing or temporarily maintaining them in formicaria specially constructed glass framed enclosures individuals may be tracked for study by marking them with dots of coloursthe successful techniques used by ant colonies have been studied in computer science and robotics to produce distributed and systems for solving problems for example ant colony optimization and ant robotics this area of biomimetics has led to studies of ant locomotion search engines that make use of foraging trails storage and networking algorithms as pets from the late through the late ant farms were popular educational children toys in the united states some later commercial versions use transparent gel instead of soil allowing greater visibility at the cost of stressing the ants with unnatural light in culture anthropomorphised ants have often been used in fables and children stories to represent industriousness and cooperative effort they also are mentioned in religious texts in the book of

were models for human society he published a five volume work from to that examined ant biology and societyin the early the video game simant which simulated an ant colony won the codie award for best simulation program ants also are quite popular inspiration for many insectoids such as the formics of ender game the bugs of starship troopers the giant ants in the films them and empire of the ants marvel comics super hero and ants mutated into in phase iv in computer strategy games species often benefit from increased production rates due to their focus such as the klackons in the master of
