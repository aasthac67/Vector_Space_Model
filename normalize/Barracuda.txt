barracuda sphyraena waitii w ogilby behavior and diet barracudas are ferocious opportunistic predators relying on surprise and short bursts of speed up to mph to overtake their prey adults of most species are more or less solitary while young and fish frequently congregate barracudas prey primarily on fish which may include some as large as themselves they kill and consume larger prey by tearing chunks of flesh barracuda are competitive species and often are seen competing against mackerel needle fish and sometimes even dolphins for preybarracuda feed on an array of prey including fish such as jacks grunts groupers snappers small tunas mullets killifishes herrings and anchovies by simply biting them in half they also seem to consume smaller species of sustenance that are in front of them barracudas are usually found swimming in saltwater searching for schools of fish their silver and elongated bodies make them difficult for prey to detect and even more difficult to be seen when viewing them barracudas depend heavily on their eyesight when they are out hunting when hunting they tend to notice everything that has an unusual color reflection or movement once a barracuda targets an intended victim its long tail and matching anal and dorsal fins enable it to move with swift bursts of speed to attack its prey before it can escape barracudas generally attack schools of fish speeding at them head first and biting at them with their jaws when barracudas age they tend to swim alone however there are times where they tend to stay with the pack barracudas will sometimes swim in groups in this case they can relocate schools of fish into compact areas or lead them into shallow water to more easily feed on them interactions with humans like sharks some species of barracuda are reputed to be dangerous to swimmers barracudas are scavengers and may mistake snorkellers for large predators following them hoping to eat the remains of their prey swimmers have reported being bitten by barracudas but such incidents are rare and possibly caused by poor visibility large barracudas can be encountered in muddy shallows on rare occasion barracudas may mistake things that glint and shine for prey one incident reported a barracuda jumping out of water and injuring a kayaker but jason schratwieser conservation director of the international game fish association said that the wound could have been caused by a houndfishhandfeeding or touching large barracudas in general is to be avoided spearfishing around barracudas can also be dangerous as they may be attracted to the injured animals and attempt to eat them as food barracudas are popular both as food and game fish they are most often eaten as fillets or steaks larger species such as the great barracuda have been implicated in cases of ciguatera food poisoning those who have been diagnosed with this type of food poisoning display symptoms of gastrointestinal discomfort limb weakness and an inability to differentiate hot from cold effectivelywest africans smoke them for use in soups and sauces smoking protects the soft flesh from disintegrating in the broth and gives it a smoky flavour in popular culture the barracuda prominently appeared in the animated film finding nemo in the beginning of the film before the main titles in the film and in the release the barracuda closes its teeth and the bottom lip is shown in the film the barracuda also appeared as an easter egg in the animated film toy story it was stuffed and mounted in display in the second chances antique store
