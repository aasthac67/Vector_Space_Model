the common merganser north american or goosander eurasian mergus merganser is a large seaduck of rivers and lakes in forested areas of europe the northern and central palearctic and north america the common merganser eats fish and nests in holes in trees taxonomy the first formal description of the common merganser was by the swedish naturalist carl linnaeus in in the tenth edition of his systema naturae he introduced the current binomial name mergus merganser the genus name is a latin word used by pliny and other roman authors to refer to an unspecified waterbird and merganser is derived from mergus and anser latin for goose in john james audubon used the name merganser in addition to goosander in his book the birds of americathere are three subspecies differing in only minor detail m m merganser linnaeus found throughout northern europe and northern asiatic russia m m orientalis gould syn m m comatus salvadori found in the central asian mountains slightly larger than m m merganser with a slenderer bill m m americanus cassin found in north america bill than in m m merganser and a black bar crossing the white inner wing visible in flight on males description it is cm in long with a cm in wingspan and a weight of kg lb males average slightly larger than females but with some overlap like other species in the genus mergus it has a crest of longer head feathers but these usually lie smoothly rounded behind the head not normally forming an erect crest adult males in breeding plumage are easily distinguished the body white with a variable tinge the head black with an iridescent green gloss the rump and tail grey and the wings largely white on the inner half black on the outer half females and males in eclipse plumage july to october are largely grey with a head white chin and white secondary feathers on the wing juveniles both sexes are similar to adult females but also show a short white stripe between the eye and bill the bill and legs are red to brightest on adult males dullest on juveniles behaviour feeding like the other mergansers these piscivorous ducks have serrated edges to their bills to help them grip their prey so they are often known as sawbills in addition to fish they take a wide range of other aquatic prey such as molluscs crustaceans worms insect larvae and amphibians more rarely small mammals and birds may be taken as in other birds with the character the tinge shown variably by males is probably obtained from the carotenoid pigments present in some crustaceans and fish when not diving for food they are usually seen swimming on the water surface or resting on rocks in midstream or hidden among riverbank vegetation or in winter on the edge of floating icein most places the common merganser is as much a frequenter of salt water as fresh water in larger streams and rivers they float down with the stream for a few miles and either fly back again or more commonly fish their way back diving incessantly the whole way in smaller streams they are present in pairs or smaller groups and they float down twisting round and round in the rapids or fishing vigorously in a deep pool near the foot of a waterfall or rapid when floating leisurely they position themselves in water similar to ducks but they also swim deep in water like cormorants especially when swimming upstream they often sit on a rock in the middle of the water similar to cormorants often their wings to the sun to rise from water they flap along the surface for many yards once they are airborne the flight is strong and rapid they often fish in a group forming a semicircle and driving the fish into shallow water where they are captured easily their ordinary voice is a low harsh croak but during the breeding season they including the young make a plaintive soft whistle generally they are wary and one or more birds stay on sentry duty to warn the flock of approaching danger when disturbed they often disgorge food before moving though they move clumsily on land they resort to running when pressed assuming a very upright position similar to penguins and falling and stumbling frequently breeding nesting is normally in a tree cavity so it requires mature forest as its breeding habitat they also readily use large nest boxes where provided requiring an entrance hole cm in in diameter in places devoid of trees like central asian mountains they use holes in cliffs and steep high banks sometimes at considerable distances from the water the female lays most often white to yellowish eggs and raises one brood in a season the ducklings are taken by their mother in her bill to rivers or lakes immediately after hatching where they feed on freshwater invertebrates and small fish fry fledging when days old the young are sexually mature at the age of two years common mergansers are known to form creches with single females having being observed with over ducklings at one time movements the species is a partial migrant with birds moving away from areas where rivers and major lakes freeze in the winter but resident where waters remain open eastern north american birds move south in small groups to the united states wherever ice free conditions exist on lakes and rivers on the milder pacific coast they are permanent residents scandinavian and russian birds also migrate southwards but western european birds and a few in japan are largely resident in some populations the males also show distinct moult migration leaving the breeding areas as soon as the young hatch to spend the summer june to september elsewhere notably most of the western european male population migrates north to estuaries in finnmark in northern norway principally tanafjord to moult leaving the females to care for the ducklings much smaller numbers of males also use estuaries in eastern scotland as a moulting area status and conservation overall the species is not threatened though illegal persecution by game fishing interests is a problem in some areas in february a rare goosander siting was documented in central park new york the bird was in obvious distress with its beak being trapped by a piece of debriswithin western europe a marked southward spread has occurred from scandinavia in the breeding range since about colonising scotland in england in and also a strong increase in the population in the alps they are very scarce in ireland with regular breeding confined to a few pairs in county wicklowthe goosander is one of the species to which the agreement on the conservation of migratory waterbirds applies references
