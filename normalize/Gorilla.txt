gorillas are predominantly herbivorous apes that inhabit the forest of central africa the genus gorilla is divided into two species the eastern gorillas and the western gorillas both critically endangered and either four or five subspecies they are the largest living primates the dna of gorillas is highly similar to that of humans from to depending on what is included and they are the next closest living relatives to humans after the chimpanzees and bonobos gorillas natural habitats cover tropical or subtropical forest in africa although their range covers a small percentage of africa gorillas cover a wide range of elevations the mountain gorilla inhabits the albertine rift montane cloud forests of the virunga volcanoes ranging in altitude from to metres to ft lowland gorillas live in dense forests and lowland swamps and marshes as low as sea level with western lowland gorillas living in central west african countries and eastern lowland gorillas living in the democratic republic of the congo near its border with rwanda etymology the word gorilla comes from the history of hanno the navigator c bc a carthaginian explorer on an expedition on the west african coast to the area that later became sierra leone members of the expedition encountered savage people the greater part of whom were women whose bodies were hairy and whom our interpreters called gorillae it is unknown whether what the explorers encountered were what we now call gorillas another species of ape or monkeys or humans skins of gorillai women brought back by hanno are reputed to have been kept at carthage until rome destroyed the city years later at the end of the punic wars bc the american physician and missionary thomas staughton savage and naturalist jeffries wyman first described the western gorilla they called it troglodytes gorilla in from specimens obtained in liberia the name was derived from ancient greek gorillai gorillai meaning of hairy women described by hanno evolution and classification the closest relatives of gorillas are the other two homininae genera chimpanzees and humans all of them having diverged from a common ancestor about million years ago human gene sequences differ only on average from the sequences of corresponding gorilla genes but there is further difference in how many copies each gene has until recently gorillas were considered to be a single species with three subspecies the western lowland gorilla the eastern lowland gorilla and the mountain gorilla there is now agreement that there are two species each with two subspecies more recently a third subspecies has been claimed to exist in one of the species the separate species and subspecies developed from a single type of gorilla during the ice age when their forest habitats shrank and became isolated from each otherprimatologists continue to explore the relationships between various gorilla populations the species and subspecies listed here are the ones upon which most scientists agree the proposed third subspecies of gorilla beringei which has not yet received a trinomen is the bwindi population of the mountain gorilla sometimes called the bwindi gorilla some variations that distinguish the classifications of gorilla include varying density size hair colour length culture and facial widths population genetics of the lowland gorillas suggest that the western and eastern lowland populations diverged thousand years ago physical characteristics gorillas move around by although they sometimes walk bipedally for short distances while carrying food or in defensive situations and some mountain gorillas use other parts of their hand to aid locomotion studies of mountain gorillas published in showed only used knuckle walking but the remainder used knuckle walking plus other parts of their walking in ways that do not use the knuckles using the backs of their hand and using their palms there is individual variation in the frequency and ease with which gorillas walk upright certain gorillas at philadelphia zoo and london zoo have been observed walking upright more frequently and for longer distances than normal with one gorilla at the philadelphia zoo named louis often doing so to avoid getting mud on his hands wild male gorillas weigh to kg to lb while adult females weigh kg lb adult males are to m ft in to ft in tall with an arm span that stretches from to m ft in to ft in female gorillas are shorter at to m ft in to ft in with smaller arm spans groves calculated the average weight of wild adult male gorillas at kg while smith and jungers found the average weight of wild adult male gorillas to be kg adult male gorillas are known as silverbacks due to the characteristic silver hair on their backs reaching to the hips the tallest gorilla recorded was a m ft in silverback with an arm span of m ft in a chest of m ft in and a weight of kg lb shot in alimbongo northern kivu in may the heaviest gorilla recorded was a m ft in silverback shot in ambam cameroon which weighed kg lb males in captivity can be overweight and reach weights up to kg lb gorilla facial structure is described as mandibular prognathism that is the mandible protrudes farther out than the maxilla adult males also have a prominent sagittal crest the eastern gorilla is more darkly coloured than the western gorilla with the mountain gorilla being the darkest of all the mountain gorilla also has the thickest hair the western lowland gorilla can be brown or grayish with a reddish forehead in addition gorillas that live in lowland forest are more slender and agile than the more bulky mountain gorillas the eastern gorilla also has a longer face and broader chest than the western gorillastudies have shown gorilla blood is not reactive to and monoclonal antibodies which would in humans indicate type o blood due to novel sequences though it is different enough to not conform with the human abo blood group system into which the other great apes fit like humans gorillas have individual fingerprints their eye colour is dark brown framed by a black ring around the iris a gorilla lifespan is normally between and years although zoo gorillas may live for years or more colo a female western gorilla at the columbus zoo and aquarium was the oldest known gorilla at years of age when she died on january distribution and habitat gorillas have a patchy distribution the range of the two species is separated by the congo river and its tributaries the western gorilla lives in west central africa while the eastern gorilla lives in east central africa between the species and even within the species gorillas live in a variety of habitats and elevations gorilla habitat ranges from montane forest to swampland eastern gorillas inhabit montane and submontane forest between and m and ft above sea level mountain gorillas live in montane forest at the higher end of the elevation range while eastern lowland gorillas live in submontane forest at the lower end in addition eastern lowland gorillas live in montane bamboo forest as well as lowland forest ranging from m ft in elevation western gorillas live in both lowland swamp forest and montane forest at elevations ranging from sea level to m ft western lowland gorillas live in swamp and lowland forest ranging up to m ft and cross river gorillas live in and submontane forest ranging from m ft nesting gorillas construct nests for daytime and night use nests tend to be simple aggregations of branches and leaves about to ft to m in diameter and are constructed by individuals gorillas unlike chimpanzees or orangutans tend to sleep in nests on the ground the young nest with their mothers but construct nests after three years of age initially close to those of their mothers gorilla nests are distributed arbitrarily and use of tree species for site and construction appears to be opportunistic by great apes is now considered to be not just animal architecture but as an important instance of tool use food and foraging a gorilla day is divided between rest periods and travel or feeding periods diets differ between and within species mountain gorillas mostly eat foliage such as leaves stems pith and shoots while fruit makes up a very small part of their diets mountain gorilla food is widely distributed and neither individuals nor groups have to compete with one another their home ranges vary from to to and their movements range around m mi or less on an average day despite eating a few species in each habitat mountain gorillas have flexible diets and can live in a variety of habitats eastern lowland gorillas have more diverse diets which vary seasonally leaves and pith are commonly eaten but fruits can make up as much as of their diets since fruit is less available lowland gorillas must travel farther each day and their home ranges vary from to with day ranges m mi eastern lowland gorillas will also eat insects preferably ants western lowland gorillas depend on fruits more than the others and they are more dispersed across their range they travel even farther than the other gorilla subspecies at m mi per day on average and have larger home ranges of western lowland gorillas have less access to terrestrial herbs although they can access aquatic herbs in some areas termites and ants are also eaten gorillas rarely drink water because they consume succulent vegetation that is comprised of almost half water as well as morning dew although both mountain and lowland gorillas have been observed drinking behaviour social structure gorillas live in groups called troops troops tend to be made of one adult male or silverback multiple adult females and their offspring however troops also exist a silverback is typically more than years of age and is named for the distinctive patch of silver hair on his back which comes with maturity silverbacks also have large canine teeth that also come with maturity both males and females tend to emigrate from their natal groups for mountain gorillas females disperse from their natal troops more than males mountain gorillas and western lowland gorillas also commonly transfer to second new groupsmature males also tend to leave their groups and establish their own troops by attracting emigrating females however male mountain gorillas sometimes stay in their natal troops and become subordinate to the silverback if the silverback dies these males may be able to become dominant or mate with the females this behaviour has not been observed in eastern lowland gorillas in a single male group when the silverback dies the females and their offspring disperse and find a new troop without a silverback to protect them the infants will likely fall victim to infanticide joining a new group is likely to be a tactic against this however while gorilla troops usually disband after the silverback dies female eastern lowlands gorillas and their offspring have been recorded staying together until a new silverback transfers into the group this likely serves as protection from leopards the silverback is the center of the troop attention making all the decisions mediating conflicts determining the movements of the group leading the others to feeding sites and taking responsibility for the safety and of the troop younger males subordinate to the silverback known as blackbacks may serve as backup protection blackbacks are aged between and years and lack the silver back hair the bond that a silverback has with his females forms the core of gorilla social life bonds between them are maintained by grooming and staying close together females form strong relationships with males to gain mating opportunities and protection from predators and infanticidal outside males however aggressive behaviours between males and females do occur but rarely lead to serious injury relationships between females may vary maternally related females in a troop tend to be friendly towards each other and associate closely otherwise females have few friendly encounters and commonly act aggressively towards each otherfemales may fight for social access to males and a male may intervene male gorillas have weak social bonds particularly in groups with apparent dominance hierarchies and strong competition for mates males in groups though tend to have friendly interactions and socialise through play grooming and staying together and occasionally they even engage in homosexual interactions severe aggression is rare in stable groups but when two mountain gorilla groups meet the two silverbacks can sometimes engage in a fight to the death using their canines to cause deep gaping injuries competition one possible predator of gorillas is the leopard gorilla remains have been found in leopard scat but this may be the result of scavenging when the group is attacked by humans leopards or other gorillas an individual silverback will protect the group even at the cost of his own life reproduction and parenting females mature at years earlier in captivity and males at years a female first ovulatory cycle occurs when she is six years of age and is followed by a period of adolescent infertility the estrous cycle lasts days with outward ovulation signs subtle compared to those of chimpanzees the gestation period lasts months female mountain gorillas first give birth at years of age and have interbirth intervals males can be fertile before reaching adulthood gorillas mate year roundfemales will purse their lips and slowly approach a male while making eye contact this serves to urge the male to mount her if the male does not respond then she will try to attract his attention by reaching towards him or slapping the ground in groups solicitation indicates female preference but females can be forced to mate with multiple males males incite copulation by approaching a female and displaying at her or touching her and giving a train grunt recently gorillas have been observed engaging in sex a trait once considered unique to humans and bonobos gorilla infants are vulnerable and dependent thus mothers their primary caregivers are important to their survival male gorillas are not active in caring for the young but they do play a role in socialising them to other youngsters the silverback has a largely supportive relationship with the infants in his troop and shields them from aggression within the group infants remain in contact with their mothers for the first five months and mothers stay near the silverback for protection infants suckle at least once per hour and sleep with their mothers in the same nestinfants begin to break contact with their mothers after five months but only for a brief period each time by months old infants move up to five meters feet from their mothers at around months the distance between mother and offspring increases and they regularly spend time away from each other in addition nursing decreases to once every two hours infants spend only half of their time with their mothers by months they enter their juvenile period at their third year and this lasts until their sixth year at this time gorillas are weaned and they sleep in a separate nest from their mothers after their offspring are weaned females begin to ovulate and soon become pregnant again the presence of play partners including the silverback minimizes conflicts in weaning between mother and offspring communication distinct vocalisations are recognised many of which are used primarily for group communication within dense vegetation sounds classified as grunts and barks are heard most frequently while traveling and indicate the whereabouts of individual group members they may also be used during social interactions when discipline is required screams and roars signal alarm or warning and are produced most often by silverbacks deep rumbling belches suggest contentment and are heard frequently during feeding and resting periods they are the most common form of intragroup communicationfor this reason conflicts are most often resolved by displays and other threat behaviours that are intended to intimidate without becoming physical the ritualized charge display is unique to gorillas the entire sequence has nine steps progressively quickening hooting symbolic feeding rising bipedally throwing vegetation with cupped hands one leg kick sideways running to slapping and tearing vegetation and thumping the ground with palms to end display intelligence gorillas are considered highly intelligent a few individuals in captivity such as koko have been taught a subset of sign language like the other great apes gorillas can laugh grieve have rich emotional lives develop strong family bonds make and use tools and think about the past and future some researchers believe gorillas have spiritual feelings or religious sentiments they have been shown to have cultures in different areas revolving around different methods of food preparation and will show individual colour preferences tool use the following observations were made by a team led by thomas breuer of the wildlife conservation society in september gorillas are now known to use tools in the wild a female gorilla in the national park in the republic of congo was recorded using a stick as if to gauge the depth of water whilst crossing a swamp a second female was seen using a tree stump as a bridge and also as a support whilst fishing in the swamp this means all of the great apes are now known to use toolsin september a gorilla in the republic of congo was discovered using rocks to smash open palm nuts inside a game sanctuary while this was the first such observation for a gorilla over years previously chimpanzees had been seen using tools in the wild for termites great apes are endowed with semiprecision grips and have been able to use both simple tools and even weapons such as improvising a club from a convenient fallen branch scientific study american physician and missionary thomas staughton savage obtained the first specimens the skull and other bones during his time in liberia the first scientific description of gorillas dates back to an article by savage and the naturalist jeffries wyman in in proceedings of the boston society of natural history where troglodytes gorilla is described now known as the western gorilla other species of gorilla were described in the next few years the explorer paul du chaillu was the first westerner to see a live gorilla during his travel through western equatorial africa from to he brought dead specimens to the uk in first systematic study was not conducted until the when carl akeley of the american museum of natural history traveled to africa to hunt for an animal to be shot and stuffed on his first trip he was accompanied by his friends mary bradley a mystery writer her husband and their young daughter alice who would later write science fiction under the pseudonym james tiptree jr after their trip mary bradley wrote on the gorilla trail she later became an advocate for the conservation of gorillas and wrote several more books mainly for children in the late and early robert yerkes and his wife ava helped further the study of gorillas when they sent harold bigham to africa yerkes also wrote a book in about the great apes after world war ii george schaller was one of the first researchers to go into the field and study primates in he conducted a systematic study of the mountain gorilla in the wild and published his work years later at the behest of louis leakey and the national geographic dian fossey conducted a much longer and more comprehensive study of the mountain gorilla when she published her work many misconceptions and myths about gorillas were finally disproved including the myth that gorillas are violent western lowland gorillas g g gorilla are believed to be one of the zoonotic origins of the sivgor simian immunodeficiency virus that infects them is similar to a certain strain of genome sequencing the gorilla became the great ape genus to have its genome sequenced the first gorilla genome was generated with short read and sanger sequencing using dna from a female western lowland gorilla named kamilah this gave scientists further insight into the evolution and origin of humans despite the chimpanzees being the closest extant relatives of humans of the human genome was found to be more like that of the gorilla in addition of the gorilla genome is closer to human or chimpanzee than the latter are to each other this is rarer around coding genes indicating pervasive selection throughout great ape evolution and has functional consequences in gene expression analysis of the gorilla genome has cast doubt on the idea that the rapid evolution of hearing genes gave rise to language in humans as it also occurred in gorillas cultural references since coming to the attention of western society in the gorillas have been a recurring element of many aspects of popular culture and media for example gorillas have featured prominently in monstrous fantasy films such as king kong additionally pulp fiction stories such as tarzan and conan the barbarian have featured gorillas as physical opponents of the titular protagonists conservation status all species and subspecies of gorilla are listed as endangered or critically endangered on the iucn red list now over western lowland gorillas are thought to exist in the wild with in zoos thanks to conservation eastern lowland gorillas have a population of under in the wild and in zoos mountain gorillas are the most severely endangered with an estimated population of about left in the wild and none in zoos threats to gorilla survival include habitat destruction and poaching for the bushmeat trade in a population of several hundred gorillas in the odzala national park republic of congo was essentially wiped out by the ebola virus a study published in science concluded more than gorillas may have died in recent outbreaks of the ebola virus in central africa the researchers indicated in conjunction with commercial hunting of these apes the virus creates a recipe for rapid ecological extinction conservation efforts include the great apes survival project a partnership between the united nations environment programme and the unesco and also an international treaty the agreement on the conservation of gorillas and their habitats concluded under convention on migratory species the gorilla
