the coyote canis latrans is a species of canine native to north america it is smaller than its close relative the wolf and slightly smaller than the closely related eastern wolf and red wolf it fills much of the same ecological niche as the golden jackal does in eurasia though it is larger and more predatory and it is sometimes called the american jackal by zoologists other names for the species largely historical include the prairie wolf and the brush wolf the coyote is listed as least concern by the international union for conservation of nature due to its wide distribution and abundance throughout north america southwards through mexico and into central america the species is versatile able to adapt to and expand into environments modified by humans it is enlarging its range with coyotes moving into urban areas in the eastern us and was sighted in eastern panama across the panama canal from their home range for the first time in the coyote has recognized subspecies the average male weighs to kg to lb and the average female to kg to lb their fur color is predominantly light gray and red or fulvous interspersed with black and white though it varies somewhat with geography it is highly flexible in social organization living either in a family unit or in loosely knit packs of unrelated individuals primarily carnivorous its diet consists mainly of deer rabbits hares rodents birds reptiles amphibians fish and invertebrates though it may also eat fruits and vegetables on occasion its characteristic vocalization is a howl made by solitary individuals humans are the coyote greatest threat followed by cougars and gray wolves in spite of this coyotes sometimes mate with gray eastern or red wolves producing coywolf hybrids in the northeastern regions of north america the eastern coyote a larger subspecies though still smaller than wolves is the result of various historical and recent matings with various types of wolves genetic studies show that most north american wolves contain some level of coyote dna the coyote is a prominent character in native american folklore mainly in aridoamerica usually depicted as a trickster that alternately assumes the form of an actual coyote or a man as with other trickster figures the coyote uses deception and humor to rebel against social conventions the animal was especially respected in mesoamerican cosmology as a symbol of military might after the european colonization of the americas it was seen in culture as a cowardly and untrustworthy animal unlike wolves gray eastern or red which have undergone an improvement of their public image attitudes towards the coyote remain largely negative description coyote males average to kg to lb in weight while females average to kg to lb though size varies geographically northern subspecies which average kg lb tend to grow larger than the southern subspecies of mexico which average kg lb body length ranges on average from to m ft in to ft in and tail length cm in with females being shorter in both body length and height the largest coyote on record was a male killed near afton wyoming on november which measured m ft in from nose to tail and weighed kg lb scent glands are located at the upper side of the base of the tail and are a colorthe color and texture of the coyote fur varies somewhat geographically the hair predominant color is light gray and red or fulvous interspersed around the body with black and white coyotes living at high elevations tend to have more black and gray shades than their counterparts which are more fulvous or the coyote fur consists of short soft underfur and long coarse guard hairs the fur of northern subspecies is longer and denser than in southern forms with the fur of some mexican and central american forms being almost hispid bristly generally adult coyotes including coywolf hybrids have a sable coat color dark neonatal coat color bushy tail with an active supracaudal gland and a white facial mask albinism is extremely rare in coyotes out of a total of coyotes killed by federal and cooperative hunters between march and june only two were albinosthe coyote is typically smaller than the gray wolf but has longer ears and a relatively larger braincase as well as a thinner frame face and muzzle the scent glands are smaller than the gray wolf but are the same color its fur color variation is much less varied than that of a wolf the coyote also carries its tail downwards when running or walking rather than horizontally as the wolf doescoyote tracks can be distinguished from those of dogs by their more elongated less rounded shape unlike dogs the upper canines of coyotes extend past the mental foramina taxonomy and evolution history at the time of the european colonization of the americas coyotes were largely confined to open plains and arid regions of the western half of the continent in early historical records distinguishing between coyotes and wolves is often difficult one record from in kaskaskia illinois written by a local priest noted that the wolves encountered there were smaller and less daring than european wolves another account from the early in edwards county mentioned wolves howling at night though these were likely coyotes this species was encountered several times during the lewis and clark expedition though it was already well known to european traders on the upper missouri lewis writing on may in northeastern montana described the coyote in these terms the small wolf or burrowing dog of the prairies are the inhabitants almost invariably of the open plains they usually associate in bands of ten or twelve sometimes more and burrow near some pass or place much frequented by game not being able alone to take deer or goat they are rarely ever found alone but hunt in bands they frequently watch and seize their prey near their burrows in these burrows they raise their young and to them they also resort when pursued when a person approaches them they frequently bark their note being precisely that of the small dog they are of an intermediate size between that of the fox and dog very active fleet and delicately formed the ears large erect and pointed the head long and pointed more like that of the fox tale long the hair and fur also resembles the fox tho is much coarser and inferior they are of a pale colour the eye of a deep sea green colour small and piercing their claws are reather longer than those of the ordinary wolf or that common to the atlantic states none of which are to be found in this quarter nor i believe above the river plat the coyote was first scientifically described by naturalist thomas say in september on the site of lewis and clark council bluffs km mi up the missouri river from the mouth of the platte during a expedition with major stephen long he had the first edition of the lewis and clark journals in hand which contained biddle edited version of lewis observations dated may his account was published in say was the first person to document the difference between a prairie wolf coyote and on the next page of his journal a wolf which he named canis nubilus great plains wolf say described the coyote as canis latrans cinereous or gray varied with black above and dull fulvous or cinnamon hair at base dusky plumbeous in the middle of its length dull cinnamon and at tip gray or black longer on the vertebral line ears erect rounded at tip cinnamon behind the hair dark plumbeous at base inside lined with gray hair eyelids edged with black superior eyelashes black beneath and at tip above supplemental lid margined with before and edged with black brown behind iris yellow pupil spot upon the lachrymal sac rostrum cinnamon tinctured with grayish on the nose lips white edged with black three series of black seta head between the ears intermixed with gray and dull cinnamon hairs dusky plumbeous at base sides paler than the back obsoletely fasciate with black above the legs legs cinnamon on the outer side more distinct on the posterior hair a dilated black abbreviated line on the anterior ones near the wrist tail bushy fusiform straight varied with gray and cinnamon a spot near the base above and tip black the tip of the trunk of the tail attains the tip of the os calcis when the leg is extended beneath white immaculate tail cinnamon towards the tip tip black posterior feet four toed anterior five toed naming and etymology the earliest written reference to the species comes from the naturalist francisco hernandez plantas y animales de la nueva espana where it is described as a spanish fox or jackal the first published usage of the word coyote which is a spanish borrowing of its nahuatl name coyotl pronunciation comes from the historian francisco javier clavijero historia de mexico in the first time it was used in english occurred in william bullock six months residence and travels in mexico where it is variously transcribed as cayjotte and cocyotie the word spelling was standardized as coyote by the alternative english names for the coyote include prairie wolf brush wolf cased wolf little wolf and american jackal its binomial name canis latrans translates to barking dog a reference to the many vocalizations they produce local and indigenous names for canis latrans evolution fossil record xiaoming wang and richard h tedford one of the foremost authorities on carnivore evolution proposed that the genus canis was the descendant of the eucyon davisi and its remains first appeared in the miocene million years ago mya in the southwestern us and mexico by the pliocene mya the larger canis lepophagus appeared in the same region and by the early pleistocene mya c latrans the coyote was in existence they proposed that the progression from eucyon davisi to c lepophagus to the coyote was linear evolution additionally c latrans and c aureus are closely related to c edwardii a species that appeared earliest spanning the late pliocene to the close of the irvingtonian late pleistocene and coyote remains indistinguishable from c latrans were contemporaneous with c edwardii in north america johnston describes c lepophagus as having a more slender skull and skeleton than the modern coyote ronald nowak found that the early populations had small delicate narrowly proportioned skulls that resemble small coyotes and appear to be ancestral to c latransc lepophagus was similar in weight to modern coyotes but had shorter limb bones that indicates a less cursorial lifestyle the coyote represents a more primitive form of canis than the gray wolf as shown by its relatively small size and its comparatively narrow skull and jaws which lack the grasping power necessary to hold the large prey in which wolves specialize this is further corroborated by the coyote sagittal crest which is low or totally flattened thus indicating a weaker bite than the wolf the coyote is not a specialized carnivore as the wolf is as shown by the larger chewing surfaces on the molars reflecting the species relative dependence on vegetable matter in these respects the coyote resembles the progenitors of the genus more so than the wolfthe oldest fossils that fall within the range of the modern coyote date to ma million years in hamilton cave west virginia ma in irvington california ma in porcupine cave colorado and in cumberland cave pennsylvania modern coyotes arose years after the quaternary extinction event compared to their modern holocene counterparts pleistocene coyotes c l orcutti were larger and more robust likely in response to larger competitors and prey pleistocene coyotes were likely more specialized carnivores than their descendants as their teeth were more adapted to shearing meat showing fewer grinding surfaces suited for processing vegetation their reduction in size occurred within years of the quaternary extinction event when their large prey died out furthermore pleistocene coyotes were unable to exploit the hunting niche left vacant after the extinction of the dire wolf c dirus as it was rapidly filled by gray wolves which likely actively killed off the large coyotes with natural selection favoring the modern gracile morph dna evidence in a study proposed that the wolves of north america display skull traits more similar to the coyote than wolves from eurasia in a study found that the coyote was a basal member of the clade that included the tibetan wolf the domestic dog the mongolian wolf and the eurasian wolf with the tibetan wolf diverging early from wolves and domestic dogs in a dna study proposed based on the assumptions made that all of the north american wolves and coyotes diverged from a common ancestor less than years ago the study also indicated that all north american wolves have a significant amount of coyote ancestry and all coyotes some degree of wolf ancestry and that the red wolf and eastern wolf are highly admixed with different proportions of gray wolf and coyote ancestry the proposed timing of the divergence conflicts with the finding of a specimen in strata dated to myagenetic studies relating to wolves or dogs have inferred phylogenetic relationships based on the only reference genome available that of the boxer dog in the first reference genome of the wolf canis lupus lupus was mapped to aid future research in a study looked at the genomic structure and admixture of north american wolves canids and coyotes using specimens from across their entire range that mapped the largest dataset of nuclear genome sequences against the wolf reference genome the study supports the findings of previous studies that north american gray wolves and canids were the result of complex gray wolf and coyote mixing a polar wolf from greenland and a coyote from mexico represented the purest specimens the coyotes from alaska california alabama and quebec show almost no wolf ancestry coyotes from missouri illinois and florida exhibit wolf ancestry there was wolf to coyote ancestry in red wolves in eastern timber wolves and in the great lakes wolves there was coyote ancestry in mexican wolves and the atlantic coast wolves in pacific coast and yellowstone wolves and less than in canadian archipelago wolves if a third canid had been involved in the admixture of the north american canids then its genetic signature would have been found in coyotes and wolves which it has notin whole genome sequencing was used to compare members of genus canis the study indicates that the common ancestor of the coyote and gray wolf has genetically admixed with a ghost population of an extinct unidentified canid the canid was genetically close to the dhole and had evolved after the divergence of the african wild dog from the other canid species the basal position of the coyote compared to the wolf is proposed to be due to the coyote retaining more of the mitochondrial genome of this unknown canid subspecies as of subspecies are recognized geographic variation in coyotes is not great though taken as a whole the eastern subspecies c l thamnos and c l frustor are large animals with a gradual paling in color and reduction in size westward and northward c l texensis c l latrans c l lestes and c l incolatus a brightening of ochraceous orange or the pacific coast c l ochropus c l umpquensis a reduction in size in aridoamerica c l microdon c l mearnsi and a general trend towards dark reddish colors and short muzzles in mexican and central american populations hybridization coyotes have occasionally mated with domestic dogs sometimes producing crosses colloquially known as coydogs such matings are rare in the wild as the mating cycles of dogs and coyotes do not coincide and coyotes are usually antagonistic towards dogs hybridization usually only occurs when coyotes are expanding into areas where conspecifics are few and dogs are the only alternatives even then pup survival rates are lower than normal as dogs do not form pair bonds with coyotes thus making the rearing of pups more difficult in captivity hybrids first generation tend to be more mischievous and less manageable as pups than dogs and are less trustworthy on maturity than hybrids hybrids vary in appearance but generally retain the coyote usual characteristics hybrids tend to be intermediate in form between dogs and coyotes while hybrids second generation are more varied both and hybrids resemble their coyote parents in terms of shyness and intrasexual aggression hybrids are fertile and can be successfully bred through four generations melanistic coyotes owe their black pelts to a mutation that first arose in domestic dogs a population of nonalbino white coyotes in newfoundland owe their coloration to a melanocortin receptor mutation inherited from golden retrievers coyotes have hybridized with wolves to varying degrees particularly in eastern north america the eastern coyote of northeastern north america probably originated in the aftermath of the extermination of gray and eastern wolves in the northeast thus allowing coyotes to colonize former wolf ranges and mix with the remnant wolf populations this hybrid is smaller than either the gray or eastern wolf and holds smaller territories but is in turn larger and holds more extensive home ranges than the typical western coyote as of the eastern coyote genetic makeup is fairly uniform with minimal influence from eastern wolves or western coyotes adult eastern coyotes are larger than western coyotes with female eastern coyotes weighing more than male western coyotes physical differences become more apparent by the age of days with eastern coyote pups having longer legs than their western counterparts differences in dental development also occurs with tooth eruption being later and in a different order in the eastern coyote aside from its size the eastern coyote is physically similar to the western coyote the four color phases range from dark brown to blond or reddish blond though the most common phase is with reddish legs ears and flanks no significant differences exist between eastern and western coyotes in aggression and fighting though eastern coyotes tend to fight less and are more playful unlike western coyote pups in which fighting precedes play behavior fighting among eastern coyote pups occurs after the onset of play eastern coyotes tend to reach sexual maturity at two years of age much later than in western coyoteseastern and red wolves are also products of varying degrees of hybridization the eastern wolf probably was a result of a admixture combined with extensive backcrossing with parent gray wolf populations the red wolf may have originated during a time of declining wolf populations in the southeastern woodlands forcing a hybridization as well as backcrossing with local parent coyote populations to the extent that about of the modern red wolf genome is of coyote derivation behavior social and reproductive behaviors like the eurasian golden jackal the coyote is gregarious but not as dependent on conspecifics as more social canid species like wolves are this is likely because the coyote is not a specialized hunter of large prey as the latter species is the basic social unit of a coyote pack is a family containing a reproductive female however unrelated coyotes may join forces for companionship or to bring down prey too large to attack singly such nonfamily packs are only temporary and may consist of bachelor males nonreproductive females and subadult young families are formed in midwinter when females enter estrus pair bonding can occur months before actual copulation takes place the copulatory tie can last minutes a female entering estrus attracts males by scent marking and howling with increasing frequency a single female in heat can attract up to seven reproductive males which can follow her for as long as a month although some squabbling may occur among the males once the female has selected a mate and copulates the rejected males do not intervene and move on once they detect other estrous females unlike the wolf which has been known to practice both monogamous and bigamous matings the coyote is strictly monogamous even in areas with high coyote densities and abundant food females that fail to mate sometimes assist their sisters or mothers in raising their pups or join their siblings until the next time they can mate the newly mated pair then establishes a territory and either constructs their own den or cleans out abandoned badger marmot or skunk earths during the pregnancy the male frequently hunts alone and brings back food for the female the female may line the den with dried grass or with fur pulled from her belly the gestation period is days with an average litter size of six though the number fluctuates depending on coyote population density and the abundance of foodcoyote pups are born in dens hollow trees or under ledges and weigh to g to lb at birth they are altricial and are completely dependent on milk for their first days the incisors erupt at about days the canines at and the second premolars at their eyes open after days by which point the pups become increasingly more mobile walking by days and running at the age of six weeks the parents begin supplementing the pup diet with regurgitated solid food after days by the age of four to six weeks when their milk teeth are fully functional the pups are given small food items such as mice rabbits or pieces of ungulate carcasses with lactation steadily decreasing after two months unlike wolf pups coyote pups begin seriously fighting as opposed to play fighting prior to engaging in play behavior a common play behavior includes the coyote by three weeks of age coyote pups bite each other with less inhibition than wolf pups by the age of four to five weeks pups have established dominance hierarchies and are by then more likely to play rather than fight the male plays an active role in feeding grooming and guarding the pups but abandons them if the female goes missing before the pups are completely weaned the den is abandoned by june to july and the pups follow their parents in patrolling their territory and hunting pups may leave their families in august though can remain for much longer the pups attain adult dimensions at eight months and gain adult weight a month later territorial and sheltering behaviors individual feeding territories vary in size from to to sq mi with the general concentration of coyotes in a given area depending on food abundance adequate denning sites and competition with conspecifics and other predators the coyote generally does not defend its territory outside of the denning season and is much less aggressive towards intruders than the wolf is typically chasing and sparring with them but rarely killing them conflicts between coyotes can arise during times of food shortage coyotes mark their territories by urination and wolves coyotes use a den usually the deserted holes of other species when gestating and rearing young though they may occasionally give birth under sagebrushes in the open coyote dens can be located in canyons washouts coulees banks rock bluffs or level ground some dens have been found under abandoned homestead shacks grain bins drainage pipes railroad tracks hollow logs thickets and thistles the den is continuously dug and cleaned out by the female until the pups are born should the den be disturbed or infested with fleas the pups are moved into another den a coyote den can have several entrances and passages branching out from the main chamber a single den can be used year after year hunting and feeding behaviors while the popular consensus is that olfaction is very important for hunting two studies that experimentally investigated the role of olfactory auditory and visual cues found that visual cues are the most important ones for hunting in red foxes and coyotes when hunting large prey the coyote often works in pairs or small groups success in killing large ungulates depends on factors such as snow depth and crust density younger animals usually avoid participating in such hunts with the breeding pair typically doing most of the work unlike the wolf which attacks large prey from the rear the coyote approaches from the front lacerating its prey head and throat like other canids the coyote caches excess food coyotes catch rodents by pouncing whereas ground squirrels are chased although coyotes can live in large groups small prey is typically caught singly coyotes have been observed to kill porcupines in pairs using their paws to flip the rodents on their backs then attacking the soft underbelly only old and experienced coyotes can successfully prey on porcupines with many predation attempts by young coyotes resulting in them being injured by their prey quills coyotes sometimes urinate on their food possibly to claim ownership over it recent evidence demonstrates that at least some coyotes have become more nocturnal in hunting presumably to avoid humanscoyotes may occasionally form mutualistic hunting relationships with american badgers assisting each other in digging up rodent prey the relationship between the two species may occasionally border on apparent friendship as some coyotes have been observed laying their heads on their badger companions or licking their faces without protest the amicable interactions between coyotes and badgers were known to civilizations as shown on a mexican jar dated to ce depicting the relationship between the twofood scraps pet food and animal feces may attract a coyote to a trash can communication body language being both a gregarious and solitary animal the variability of the coyote visual and vocal repertoire is intermediate between that of the solitary foxes and the highly social wolf the aggressive behavior of the coyote bears more similarities to that of foxes than it does that of wolves and dogs an aggressive coyote arches its back and lowers its tail unlike dogs which solicit playful behavior by performing a followed by a play in coyotes consists of a bow followed by head flexions and a series of spins and dives although coyotes will sometimes bite their playmates scruff as dogs do they typically approach low and make bites pups fight each other regardless of sex while among adults aggression is typically reserved for members of the same sex combatants approach each other waving their tails and snarling with their jaws open though fights are typically silent males tend to fight in a vertical stance while females fight on all four paws fights among females tend to be more serious than ones among males as females seize their opponents forelegs throat and shoulders vocalizations the coyote has been described as the most vocal of all wild north american mammals its loudness and range of vocalizations was the cause for its binomial name canis latrans meaning barking dog at least different vocalizations are known in adult coyotes these sounds are divided into three categories agonistic and alarm greeting and contact vocalizations of the first category include woofs growls huffs barks bark howls yelps and whines woofs are used as threats or alarms and are usually heard near den sites prompting the pups to immediately retreat into their burrows growls are used as threats at short distances but have also been heard among pups playing and copulating males huffs are threat vocalizations produced by rapid expiration of air barks can be classed as both threat vocalizations and as alarm calls bark howls may serve similar functions yelps are emitted as a sign of submission while whines are produced by dominant animals acknowledging the submission of subordinates greeting vocalizations include whines and group yip howls whines are emitted by submissive animals and are usually accompanied by tail wagging and muzzle nibbling the sound known as has been described as a greeting song the group yip howl is emitted when two or more pack members reunite and may be the final act of a complex greeting ceremony contact calls include lone howls and group howls as well as the previously mentioned group yip howls the lone howl is the most iconic sound of the coyote and may serve the purpose of announcing the presence of a lone individual separated from its pack group howls are used as both substitute group yip howls and as responses to either lone howls group howls or group yip howls ecology habitat prior to the near extermination of wolves and cougars the coyote was most numerous in grasslands inhabited by bison pronghorn elk and other deer doing particularly well in areas with prairie dogs though it was just as much at home in semiarid areas with sagebrush and jackrabbits or in deserts inhabited by cactus kangaroo rats and rattlesnakes as long as it was not in direct competition with the wolf the coyote ranged from the sonoran desert to the alpine regions of adjoining mountains or the plains and mountainous areas of alberta with the extermination of the wolf the coyote range expanded to encompass broken forests from the tropics of guatemala and the northern slope of alaskacoyotes walk around kilometres mi per day often along trails such as logging roads and paths they may use rivers as travel routes in winter they are often crepuscular being more active around evening and the beginning of the night than during the day like many canids coyotes are competent swimmers reported to be able to travel at least kilometres mi across water diet the coyote is ecologically the north american equivalent of the eurasian golden jackal likewise the coyote is highly versatile in its choice of food but is primarily carnivorous with of its diet consisting of meat prey species include bison largely as carrion deer mule deer moose elk bighorn sheep pronghorn rabbits hares rodents birds especially galliforms young water birds and pigeons and doves amphibians except toads lizards snakes turtles and tortoises fish crustaceans and insects coyotes may be picky over the prey they target as animals such as shrews moles and brown rats do not occur in their diet in proportion to their numbers however terrestrial burrowing small mammals such as ground squirrels and associated species marmots prairie dogs chipmunks as well as voles pocket gophers kangaroo rats and other rodents may be quite common foods especially for lone coyotes more unusual prey include fishers young black bear cubs harp seals and rattlesnakes coyotes kill rattlesnakes mostly for food but also to protect their pups at their dens by teasing the snakes until they stretch out and then biting their heads and snapping and shaking the snakes birds taken by coyotes may range in size from thrashers larks and sparrows to adult wild turkeys and possibly brooding adult swans and pelicans if working in packs or pairs coyotes may have access to larger prey than lone individuals normally take such as various prey weighing more than kg lb in some cases packs of coyotes have dispatched much larger prey such as adult odocoileus deer cow elk pronghorns and wild sheep although the young fawn calves and lambs of these animals are considerably more often taken even by packs as well as domestic sheep and domestic cattle in some cases coyotes can bring down prey weighing up to to kg to lb or more when it comes to adult ungulates such as wild deer they often exploit them when vulnerable such as those that are infirm stuck in snow or ice otherwise or heavily pregnant whereas less wary domestic ungulates may be more easily exploitedalthough coyotes prefer fresh meat they will scavenge when the opportunity presents itself excluding the insects fruit and grass eaten the coyote requires an estimated g lb of food daily or kg lb annually the coyote readily cannibalizes the carcasses of conspecifics with coyote fat having been successfully used by coyote hunters as a lure or poisoned bait the coyote winter diet consists mainly of large ungulate carcasses with very little plant matter rodent prey increases in importance during the spring summer and fallthe coyote feeds on a variety of different produce including blackberries blueberries peaches pears apples prickly pears chapotes persimmons peanuts watermelons cantaloupes and carrots during the winter and early spring the coyote eats large quantities of grass such as green wheat blades it sometimes eats unusual items such as cotton cake soybean meal domestic animal droppings beans and cultivated grain such as maize wheat and sorghumin coastal california coyotes now consume a higher percentage of food than their ancestors which is thought to be due to the extirpation of the grizzly bear from this region in death valley coyotes may consume great quantities of hawkmoth caterpillars or beetles in the spring flowering months enemies and competitors in areas where the ranges of coyotes and gray wolves overlap interference competition and predation by wolves has been hypothesized to limit local coyote densities coyote ranges expanded during the and centuries following the extirpation of wolves while coyotes were driven to extinction on isle royale after wolves colonized the island in the one study conducted in yellowstone national park where both species coexist concluded that the coyote population in the lamar river valley declined by following the reintroduction of wolves in the while coyote populations in wolf inhabited areas of the grand teton national park are lower than in areas where they are absent wolves have been observed to not tolerate coyotes in their vicinity though coyotes have been known to trail wolves to feed on their killscoyotes may compete with cougars in some areas in the eastern sierra nevadas coyotes compete with cougars over mule deer cougars normally outcompete and dominate coyotes and may kill them occasionally thus reducing coyote predation pressure on smaller carnivores such as foxes and bobcats coyotes that are killed are sometimes not eaten perhaps indicating that these compromise competitive interspecies interactions however there are multiple confirmed cases of cougars also eating coyotes in northeastern mexico cougar predation on coyotes continues apace but coyotes were absent from the prey spectrum of sympatric jaguars apparently due to differing habitat usagesother than by gray wolves and cougars predation on adult coyotes is relatively rare but multiple other predators can be occasional threats in some cases adult coyotes have been preyed upon by both american black and grizzly bears american alligators large canada lynx and golden eagles at kill sites and carrion coyotes especially if working alone tend to be dominated by wolves cougars bears wolverines and usually but not always eagles ie bald and golden when such larger more powerful more aggressive predators such as these come to a shared feeding site a coyote may either try to fight wait until the other predator is done or occasionally share a kill but if a major danger such as wolves or an adult cougar is present the coyote will tend to fleecoyotes rarely kill healthy adult red foxes and have been observed to feed or den alongside them though they often kill foxes caught in traps coyotes may kill fox kits but this is not a major source of mortality in southern california coyotes frequently kill gray foxes and these smaller canids tend to avoid areas with high coyote densitiesin some areas coyotes share their ranges with bobcats these two species rarely physically confront one another though bobcat populations tend to diminish in areas with high coyote densities however several studies have demonstrated interference competition between coyotes and bobcats and in all cases coyotes dominated the interaction multiple researchers reported instances of coyotes killing bobcats whereas bobcats killing coyotes is more rare coyotes attack bobcats using a method similar to what is used on prey coyotes both single individuals and groups have been known to occasionally kill bobcats in most cases the bobcats were relatively small specimens such as adult females and juveniles however coyote attacks by an unknown number of coyotes on adult male bobcats have occurred in california coyote and bobcat populations are not negatively correlated across different habitat types but predation by coyotes is an important source of mortality in bobcats biologist stanley paul young noted that in his entire trapping career he had never successfully saved a captured bobcat from being killed by coyotes and wrote of two incidents wherein coyotes chased bobcats up trees coyotes have been documented to directly kill canada lynx on occasion and compete with them for prey especially snowshoe hares in some areas including central alberta lynx are more abundant where coyotes are few thus interactions with coyotes appears to influence lynx populations more than the availability of snowshoe hares range due to the coyote wide range and abundance throughout north america it is listed as least concern by the international union for conservation of nature iucn the coyote range was limited to the southwest and plains regions of north america and northern and central mexico by the century the species expanded north and east expanding further after coinciding with land conversion and the extirpation of wolves by this time its range encompassed the entire north american continent including all of the contiguous united states and mexico southward into central america and northward into most of canada and alaska this expansion is ongoing and the species now occupies the majority of areas between panama and northern alaska although it was once widely believed that coyotes are recent immigrants to southern mexico and central america aided in their expansion by deforestation pleistocene and early holocene records as well as records from the period and early european colonization show that the animal was present in the area long before modern times nevertheless range expansion did occur south of costa rica during the late and northern panama in the early following the expansion of lands into tropical rain forests the coyote is predicted to appear in northern belize in the near future as the habitat there is favorable to the species concerns have been raised of a possible expansion into south america through the panamanian isthmus should the darien gap ever be closed by the highway this fear was partially confirmed in january when the species was recorded in eastern panama chepo district beyond the panama canala genetic study proposes that coyotes were originally not found in the area of the eastern united states from the dense forests were transformed into agricultural land and wolf control implemented on a large scale leaving a niche for coyotes to disperse into there were two major dispersals from two populations of genetically distinct coyotes the first major dispersal to the northeast came in the early century from those coyotes living in the northern great plains these came to new england via the northern great lakes region and southern canada and to pennsylvania via the southern great lakes region meeting together in the in new york and pennsylvania these coyotes have hybridized with the remnant gray wolf and eastern wolf populations which has added to coyote genetic diversity and may have assisted adaptation to the new niche the second major dispersal to the southeast came in the century from texas and reached the carolinas in the these coyotes have hybridized with the remnant red wolf populations before the when the red wolf was extirpated in the wild which has also added to coyote genetic diversity and may have assisted adaptation to this new niche as well both of these two major coyote dispersals have experienced rapid population growth and are forecast to meet along the coast the study concludes that for coyotes the long range dispersal gene flow from local populations and rapid population growth may be diseases and parasites among large north american carnivores the coyote probably carries the largest number of diseases and parasites likely due to its wide range and varied diet viral diseases known to infect coyotes include rabies canine distemper infectious canine hepatitis four strains of equine encephalitis and oral papillomatosis by the late serious rabies outbreaks in coyotes had ceased to be a problem for over years though sporadic cases every years did occur distemper causes the deaths of many pups in the wild though some specimens can survive infection tularemia a bacterial disease infects coyotes from tick bites and through their rodent and lagomorph prey and can be deadly for pupscoyotes can be infected by both demodectic and sarcoptic mange the latter being the most common mite infestations are rare and incidental in coyotes while tick infestations are more common with seasonal peaks depending on locality in the northwest in arkansas coyotes are only rarely infested with lice while fleas infest coyotes from puphood though they may be more a source of irritation than serious illness pulex simulans is the most common species to infest coyotes while ctenocephalides canis tends to occur only in places where coyotes and dogs its primary host inhabit the same area although coyotes are rarely host to flukes they can nevertheless have serious effects on coyotes particularly nanophyetus salmincola which can infect them with salmon poisoning disease a disease with a mortality rate trematode metorchis conjunctus can also infect coyotes tapeworms have been recorded to infest of all coyotes examined the most common species to infest coyotes are taenia pisiformis and taenia crassiceps which uses cottontail rabbits as intermediate hosts the largest species known in coyotes is t hydatigena which enters coyotes through infected ungulates and can grow to lengths of to cm to in although once largely limited to wolves echinococcus granulosus has expanded to coyotes since the latter began colonizing former wolf ranges the most frequent ascaroid roundworm in coyotes is toxascaris leonina which dwells in the coyote small intestine and has no ill effects except for causing the host to eat more frequently hookworms of the genus ancylostoma infest coyotes throughout their range being particularly prevalent in humid areas in areas of high moisture such as coastal texas coyotes can carry up to hookworms each the a caninum is particularly dangerous as it damages the coyote through blood loss and lung congestion a pup can die from being host to as few as a caninum worms relationships with humans in folklore and mythology coyote features as a trickster figure and in the folktales of some native americans notably several nations in the southwestern and plains regions where he alternately assumes the form of an actual coyote or that of a man as with other trickster figures coyote acts as a picaresque hero who rebels against social convention through deception and humor folklorists such as harris believe coyotes came to be seen as tricksters due to the animal intelligence and

fully coyotes livestock and pet predation coyotes are presently the most abundant livestock predators in western north america causing the majority of sheep goat and cattle losses for example according to the national agricultural statistics service coyotes were responsible for of the sheep deaths attributed to predation in the total number of sheep deaths in comprised of the total sheep and lamb population in the united states which according to the national agricultural statistics service usda report totaled million and million heads respectively as of july because coyote populations are typically many times greater and more widely distributed than those of wolves coyotes cause more overall predation losses united states government agents routinely shoot poison trap and kill about coyotes each year to protect livestock an idaho census taken in showed that individual coyotes were as likely to attack livestock as individual wolves in utah more than coyotes were killed for bounties totaling over in the fiscal year ending june guardian dogs are commonly used to aggressively repel predators and have worked well in both fenced pasture and range operations a

controlling coyotes discussed by temple grandin of colorado state university this method is gaining popularity among producers who allow their herds to calve on the range and whose cattle graze open pastures throughout the yearcoyotes typically bite the throat just behind the jaw and below the ear when attacking adult sheep or goats with death commonly resulting from suffocation blood loss is usually a secondary cause of death calves and heavily fleeced sheep are killed by attacking the flanks or hindquarters causing shock and blood loss when attacking smaller prey such as young lambs the kill is made by biting the skull and spinal regions causing massive tissue and bone damage small or young prey may be completely carried off leaving only blood as evidence of a kill coyotes usually leave the hide and most of the skeleton of larger animals relatively intact unless food is scarce in which case they may leave only the largest bones scattered bits of wool skin and other parts are characteristic where coyotes feed extensively on larger carcasses tracks are an important factor in distinguishing coyote from dog predation coyote tracks tend to be more and compact than those of domestic dogs and their claw marks are less prominent and the tracks tend to follow a straight line more closely than those of dogs with the exception of sighthounds most dogs of similar weight to coyotes have a slightly shorter stride coyote kills can be distinguished from wolf kills by less damage to the underlying tissues in the former also coyote scat tends to be smaller than wolf scatcoyotes are often attracted to dog food and animals that are small enough to appear as prey items such as garbage pet food and sometimes feeding stations for birds and squirrels attract coyotes into backyards about three to five pets attacked by coyotes are brought into the animal urgent care hospital of south orange county california each week the majority of which are dogs since cats typically do not survive the attacks scat analysis collected near claremont california revealed that coyotes relied heavily on pets as a food source in winter and spring at one location in southern california coyotes began relying on a colony of feral cats as a food source over time the coyotes killed most of the cats and then continued to eat the cat food placed daily at the colony site by people who were maintaining the cat colony coyotes usually attack dogs but they have been known to attack even large powerful breeds such as the rottweiler in exceptional cases dogs larger than coyotes such as greyhounds are generally able to drive them off and have been known to kill coyotes smaller breeds are more likely to suffer injury or death hunting coyote hunting is one of the most common forms of predator hunting that humans partake in there are not many regulations with regard to the taking of the coyote which means there are many different methods that can be used to hunt the animal the most common forms are trapping calling and hound hunting since coyotes are colorblind seeing only in shades of gray and subtle blues open camouflages and plain patterns are ideal the average male coyote weighs to kg to lbs and the average female coyote to kg to lbs a universal projectile that can perform between those weights is the remington when hunting it is important the projectile expand in the target after the entry but before the exit this way the projectile delivers the most energy the remington has proven to deliver this energy effectively and reliably coyotes being the light and agile animals they are they often leave a very light impression on terrain the coyote footprint is oblong approximately cm long and cm wide there are claws in both their front and hind paws the coyote center pad is relatively shaped like that of a rounded triangle like the domestic dog the coyote front paw is slightly larger than the hind paw it is also important to note that
