the guanaco lama guanicoe is a camelid native to south america closely related to the llama its name comes from the quechua word huanaco modern spelling wanaku young guanacos are called chulengos characteristics the guanaco stands between and m ft in and ft in at the shoulder body length of to m ft in to ft in and weighs to kg to lb its color varies very little unlike the domestic llama ranging from a light brown to dark cinnamon and shading to white underneath guanacos have grey faces and small straight ears guanaco is one of the largest terrestrial mammals native to today south america other terrestrial mammalian megafauna to weigh similar to or exceed guanaco include the tapirs the marsh deer the deer the spectacled bear and the jaguar the guanaco has thick skin on its neck a trait also found in its domestic counterpart the llama and in its relatives the wild vicuna and domesticated alpaca this protects its neck from predator attacks bolivians use the of these animals to make shoes flattening and pounding the skin to be used for the soles in chile hunting is allowed only in tierra del fuego where the only population not classified as endangered in the country resides between and guanacos were legally hunted in tierra del fuego hemoglobin levels guanacos are often found at high altitudes up to meters above sea level except in patagonia where the southerly latitude means ice covers the vegetation at these altitudes for guanacos to survive in the low oxygen levels found at these high altitudes their blood is rich in red blood cells a teaspoon of guanaco blood contains about billion red blood cells four times that of a human guanaco fiber guanaco fiber is particularly prized for its soft warm feel and is found in luxury fabric the guanaco soft wool is valued second only to that of the vicuna the pelts particularly from the calves are sometimes used as a substitute for red fox pelts because the texture is difficult to differentiate like their domestic descendant the llama the guanaco is with coarse guard hairs and a soft undercoat the hairs of which are about u in diameter and comparable to the best cashmere subspecies lama guanicoe guanicoe lama guanicoe cacsilensis lama guanicoe voglii lama guanicoe huanacus population and distribution guanacos inhabit the steppes scrublands and mountainous regions of south america they are found in the altiplano of peru bolivia and chile and in patagonia with a small population in paraguay in argentina they are more numerous in patagonian regions as well as in places such as isla grande de tierra del fuego in these areas they have more robust populations since grazing competition from livestock is limited estimates as of place their numbers at to in argentina in bolivia in chile in paraguay in peru a small introduced population exists on staats island in the falkland islands with a population of around as of live in herds composed of females their young and a dominant male bachelor males form separate herds while reproductive groups tend to remain small often containing no more than adults bachelor herds may contain as many as males when they feel threatened guanacos alert the herd to flee with a bleating call the male usually runs behind the herd to defend them they can run at km mi per hour often over steep and rocky terrain they are also excellent swimmers a guanaco typical lifespan is to years atacama desert some guanacos live in the atacama desert where in some areas it has not rained for over years a mountainous coastline running parallel to the desert enables them to survive in what are called fog oases or lomas where the cool water touches the hotter land the air above the desert is cooled creating a fog and thus water vapor winds carry the fog across the desert where cacti catch the water droplets and lichens that cling to the cacti soak it in like a sponge guanacos then eat the cacti flowers and the lichens ecology natural predators of the guanaco include pumas and foxes when threatened they alert the rest of the herd with a bleating sound which sounds similar to a short sharp laugh though typically guanacos often spit when threatened and can do so up to a distance of six feet mating season mating season occurs between november and february during which males often fight violently to establish dominance and breeding rights months later a single chulengo is born chulengos are able to walk immediately after birth male chulengos are chased off from the herd by the dominant male around one year of age domestication although the species is still considered wild around guanacos are in us zoos and around are registered in private herds guanacos have long been thought to be the parent species of the domesticated llama which was confirmed via molecular phylogenetic analysis in although the analysis also found that domestic llamas had experienced considerable with alpacas which are descended from the wild vicuna see also camel
