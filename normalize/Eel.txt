an eel is any fish belonging to the order anguilliformes which consists of eight suborders families genera and about species eels undergo considerable development from the early larval stage to the eventual adult stage and most are predators the term eel is also used for some other fish such as electric eels genus electrophorus spiny eels family mastacembelidae and spiny eels family notacanthidae these other clades however evolved their shapes independently from the true eels description eels are elongated fish ranging in length from cm in in the eel monognathus ahlstromi to m ft in the slender giant moray adults range in weight from g oz to well over kg lb they possess no pelvic fins and many species also lack pectoral fins the dorsal and anal fins are fused with the caudal fin forming a single ribbon running along much of the length of the animal eels swim by generating body waves which travel the length of their bodies they can swim backwards by reversing the direction of the wavemost eels live in the shallow waters of the ocean and burrow into sand mud or amongst rocks a majority of eel species are nocturnal thus are rarely seen sometimes they are seen living together in holes or eel pits some species of eels also live in deeper water on the continental shelves and over the slopes deep as m ft only members of the anguilla regularly inhabit fresh water but they too return to the sea to breedthe heaviest true eel is the european conger the maximum size of this species has been reported as reaching a length of m ft and a weight of kg lb other eels are longer but do not weigh as much such as the slender giant moray which reaches m ft the eel is referred to as the devil of the sea lifecycle eels begin life as flat and transparent larvae called leptocephali eel larvae drift in the surface waters of the sea feeding on marine snow small particles that float in the water eel larvae then metamorphose into glass eels and then become elvers before finally seeking out their juvenile and adult habitats many eels remain in the sea throughout their lives but freshwater elvers of eels in the family anguillidae travel upstream and are forced to climb up obstructions such as weirs dam walls and natural waterfalls lady colin campbell this redirect is to the wrong person the referenced book was published in the century found at ballisodare the eel fisheries were greatly improved by the hanging of loosely plaited grass ladders over barriers enabling the elvers to ascend classification this classification follows fishbase in dividing the eels into families additional families included in other classifications notably itis and systema naturae are noted below the family with which they are synonymized in the fish base system identifying the origin of the freshwater species has been problematic genomic studies indicate they are a monophyletic group which originated among the eels suborders and families taxonomy based on nelson grande and
