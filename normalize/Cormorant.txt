phalacrocoracidae is a family of approximately species of aquatic birds commonly known as cormorants and shags several different classifications of the family have been proposed recently and the number of genera is disputed the great cormorant p carbo and the common shag p aristotelis are the only two species of the family commonly encountered on the british isles and cormorant and shag appellations have been later assigned to different species in the family somewhat haphazardly cormorants and shags are birds with body weight in the range of kilograms lb and wing span of centimetres in the majority of species have dark feathers the bill is long thin and hooked their feet have webbing between all four toes all species are catching the prey by diving from the surface they are excellent divers and under water they propel themselves with their feet with help from their wings some cormorant species have been found to dive as deep as metres ft they have relatively short wings due to their need for economical movement underwater and consequently have the highest flight costs of any flying birdcormorants nest in colonies around the shore on trees islets or cliffs they are coastal rather than oceanic birds and some have colonised inland waters indeed the original ancestor of cormorants seems to have been a bird they range around the world except for the central pacific islands names no consistent distinction exists between cormorants and shags the names and were originally the common names of the two species of the family found in great britain phalacrocorax carbo now referred to by ornithologists as the great cormorant and p aristotelis the european shag shag refers to the bird crest which the british forms of the great cormorant lack as other species were encountered by sailors and explorers elsewhere in the world some were called cormorants and some shags depending on whether they had crests or not sometimes the same species is called a cormorant in one part of the world and a shag in another eg the great cormorant is called the black shag in new zealand the birds found in australasia have a crest that is absent in european members of the species van tets proposed to divide the family into two genera and attach the name cormorant to one and shag to the other but this flies in the face of common usage and has not been widely adopted the scientific genus name is latinised ancient greek from phalakros phalakros bald and korax korax raven this is often thought to refer to the creamy white patch on the cheeks of adult great cormorants or the ornamental white head plumes prominent in mediterranean birds of this species but is certainly not a unifying characteristic of cormorants cormorant is a contraction derived either directly from latin corvus marinus sea raven or through brythonic celtic cormoran is the cornish name of the sea giant in the tale of jack the giant killer indeed sea raven or analogous terms were the usual terms for cormorants in germanic languages until after the middle ages the french explorer andre thevet commented in the beak is similar to that of a cormorant or other corvid which demonstrates that the erroneous belief that the birds were related to ravens lasted at least to the century description cormorants and shags are seabirds they range in size from the pygmy cormorant phalacrocorax pygmaeus at as little as cm in and g oz to the flightless cormorant phalacrocorax harrisi at a maximum size cm in and kg lb the recently extinct spectacled cormorant phalacrocorax perspicillatus was rather larger at an average size of kg lb the majority including nearly all northern hemisphere species have mainly dark plumage but some southern hemisphere species are black and white and a few eg the spotted shag of new zealand are quite colourful many species have areas of coloured skin on the face the lores and the gular skin which can be bright blue orange red or yellow typically becoming more brightly coloured in the breeding season the bill is long thin and sharply hooked their feet have webbing between all four toes as in their relatives habitat they are coastal rather than oceanic birds and some have colonised inland waters indeed the original ancestor of cormorants seems to have been a bird judging from the habitat of the most ancient lineage they range around the world except for the central pacific islands behaviour all are dining on small eels fish and even water snakes they dive from the surface though many species make a characteristic as they dive presumably to give themselves a more streamlined entry into the water under water they propel themselves with their feet though some also propel themselves with their wings see the picture commentary and existing reference video some cormorant species have been found using depth gauges to dive to depths of as much as metres ft after fishing cormorants go ashore and are frequently seen holding their wings out in the sun all cormorants have preen gland secretions that are used ostensibly to keep the feathers waterproof some sources state that cormorants have waterproof feathers while others say that they have feathers still others suggest that the outer plumage absorbs water but does not permit it to penetrate the layer of air next to the skin the wing drying action is seen even in the flightless cormorant but commonly in the antarctic shags and cormorants alternate functions suggested for the posture include that it aids thermoregulation or digestion balances the bird or indicates presence of fish a detailed study of the great cormorant concludes that it is without doubt to dry the plumagecormorants are colonial nesters using trees rocky islets or cliffs the eggs are a colour there is usually one brood a year parents regurgitate food to feed their young whose deep ungainly bills show a greater resemblance to those of the pelicans to which they are related than is obvious in the adults taxonomy the cormorants are a group traditionally placed within the pelecaniformes or in the taxonomy the expanded ciconiiformes this latter group is certainly not a natural one and even after the tropicbirds have been recognised as quite distinct the remaining pelecaniformes seem not to be entirely monophyletic their relationships and delimitation apart from being part of a higher waterfowl clade which is similar but not identical to sibley and ahlquist remain mostly unresolved notwithstanding all evidence agrees that the cormorants and shags are closer to the darters and sulidae gannets and boobies and perhaps the pelicans or even penguins than to all other living birdsin recent years three preferred treatments of the cormorant family have emerged either to leave all living cormorants in a single genus phalacrocorax or to split off a few species such as the imperial shag complex in leucocarbo and perhaps the flightless cormorant alternatively the genus may be disassembled altogether and in the most extreme case be reduced to the great and japanese cormorantspending a thorough review of the recent and prehistoric cormorants the approach is followed here for three reasons first it is preferable to tentatively assigning genera without a robust hypothesis second it makes it easier to deal with the fossil forms the systematic treatment of which has been no less controversial than that of living cormorants and shags third this scheme is also used by the iucn making it easier to incorporate data on status and conservation in accordance with the treatment there the imperial shag complex is here left unsplit as well but the king shag complex has been the cormorants and the darters have a unique bone on the back of the top of the skull known as the os nuchale or occipital style which was called a xiphoid process in early literature this bony projection provides anchorage for the muscles that increase the force with which the lower mandible is closed this bone and the highly developed muscles over it the m adductor mandibulae caput nuchale are unique to the families phalacrocoracidae and anhingidaeseveral evolutionary groups are still recognizable however combining the available evidence suggests that there has also been a great deal of convergent evolution for example the cliff shags are a convergent paraphyletic group the proposed division into phalacrocorax sensu stricto or subfamily phalacrocoracinae cormorants and leucocarbo sensu lato or leucocarboninae shags does indeed have some degree of merit the resolution provided by the mtdna rrna and atpase subunits six and eight sequence data is not sufficient to properly resolve several groups to satisfaction in addition many species remain unsampled the fossil record has not been integrated in the data and the effects of hybridisation known in some pacific species especially on the dna sequence data are unstudied list of genera the family contains three genera for details see the article list of cormorant species microcarbo species phalacrocorax species including one extinct in century leucocarbo species evolution and fossil record cormorants seem to be a very ancient group with similar ancestors reaching back to the time of the dinosaurs in fact the earliest known modern bird gansus yumenensis had essentially the same structure the details of the evolution of the cormorant are mostly unknown even the technique of using the distribution and relationships of a species to figure out where it came from biogeography usually very informative does not give very specific data for this probably rather ancient and widespread group however the closest living relatives of the cormorants and shags are the other families of the suborder and gannets and have a primarily gondwanan distribution hence at least the modern diversity of sulae probably originated in the southern hemisphere while the leucocarbonines are almost certainly of southern pacific even the antarctic which at the time when cormorants evolved was not yet that can be said about the phalacrocoracines is that they are most diverse in the regions bordering the indian ocean but generally occur over a large area similarly the origin of the family is shrouded in uncertainties some late cretaceous fossils have been proposed to belong with the phalacrocoracidae a scapula from the boundary about mya million years ago was found in the nemegt formation in mongolia it is now in the pin collection it is from a bird roughly the size of a spectacled cormorant and quite similar to the corresponding bone in phalacrocorax a maastrichtian late cretaceous c mya right femur amnh fr from the lance formation near lance creek wyoming is sometimes suggested to be the record of the phalacrocoracidae this was from a rather smaller bird about the size of a cormorantas the early oligocene sula ronzoni can not be assigned to any of the suloid and shags darters and gannets and certainty the best interpretation is that the phalacrocoracidae diverged from their closest ancestors in the early oligocene perhaps some million years ago and that the cretaceous fossils represent ancestral suloids pelecaniforms or higher waterbirds at least the last lineage is generally believed to have been already distinct and undergoing evolutionary radiation at the end of the cretaceous what can be said with near certainty is that amnh fr is from a diving bird that used its feet for underwater locomotion as this is liable to result in some degree of convergent evolution and the bone is missing indisputable neornithine features it is not entirely certain that the bone is correctly referred to this groupduring the late paleogene when the family presumably originated much of eurasia was covered by shallow seas as the indian plate finally attached to the mainland lacking a detailed study it may well be that the first modern cormorants were small species from eastern or southern asia possibly living in freshwater habitat that dispersed due to tectonic events such a scenario would account for the distribution of cormorants and shags and is not contradicted by the fossil record as remarked above a thorough review of the problem is not yet available two distinct genera of prehistoric cormorants are widely accepted today if phalacrocorax is used for all living species limicorallus indricotherium middle oligocene of kazakhstan nectornis late miocene of central europe middle miocene of turkey includes oligocorax miocaenusthe proposed genus oligocorax appears to be paraphyletic the european species have been separated in nectornis and the north american ones are placed in the expanded phalacrocorax a late oligocene fossil cormorant foot from enspel germany sometimes placed herein would then be referable to nectornis if it proves not to be too distinct all these early european species might belong to the basal group of microcormorants as they conform with them in size and seem to have inhabited the same habitat subtropical coastal or inland waters limicorallus meanwhile was initially believed to be a rail or a dabbling duck by some there are also undescribed remains of apparent cormorants from the quercy phosphorites of quercy france dating to some time between the late eocene and the some other paleogene remains are sometimes assigned to the phalacrocoracidae but these birds seem quite intermediate between cormorants and darters and lack clear autapomorphies of either thus they may be quite basal members of the palacrocoracoidea the taxa in question are piscator late eocene of england pelecaniformes gen et sp indet jebel qatrani early oligocene of fayum egypt similar to piscator borvocarbo late oligocene of c europe the supposed late

the world archaeological evidence suggests that cormorant fishing was practiced in ancient egypt peru korea and india but the strongest tradition has remained in china and japan where it reached level in some areas in japan cormorant fishing is called ukai Ti Si  traditional forms of ukai can be seen on the nagara river in the city of gifu gifu prefecture where cormorant fishing has continued uninterrupted for years or in the city of inuyama aichi in guilin guangxi cormorants are famous for fishing on the shallow li river in gifu the japanese cormorant p capillatus is used chinese fishermen often employ great cormorants p carbo in europe a similar practice was also used on doiran lake in the region of macedoniain a common technique a snare is tied near the base of the bird throat which allows the bird only to swallow small fish when the bird captures and tries to swallow a large fish the fish is caught in the bird throat when the bird returns to the fisherman raft the fisherman helps the bird to remove the fish from its throat the method is not as common today since more efficient methods of catching fish have been developed but is still practiced as a cultural tradition in folklore literature and art cormorants feature in heraldry and medieval ornamentation usually in their pose which was seen as representing the christian cross and symbolizing nobility and sacrifice for john milton in paradise lost the cormorant symbolizes greed perched atop the tree of life satan took the form of a cormorant as he spied on adam and eve during his first intrusion into edenin some scandinavian areas they are considered good omen in particular in norwegian tradition spirits of those lost at sea come to visit their loved ones disguised as cormorants for example the norwegian municipalities of rost loppa and skjervoy have cormorants in their coat of arms the symbolic liver bird of liverpool is commonly thought to be a cross between an eagle and a cormorant in homer epic poem the odyssey odysseus ulysses is saved by a compassionate sea nymph who takes the form of a cormorant in a woman wearing a dress made of cormorant feathers was found on san nicolas island off the southern coast of california she had sewn the feather dress together using whale sinews she is known as the lone woman of san nicolas and was later baptised juana maria her original name is lost the woman had lived alone on the island for years before being rescued when removed from san nicolas she brought with her a green cormorant dress she made this dress is reported to have been removed to the vaticanthe bird has inspired numerous writers including amy clampitt who wrote a poem called the cormorant in its element the species she described may have been the pelagic
