the binturong arctictis binturong also known as bearcat is a viverrid native to south and southeast asia it is uncommon in much of its range and has been assessed as vulnerable on the iucn red list because of a declining population trend that is estimated at more than since the mid binturong was first described by thomas stamford raffles in the genus arctictis is monotypic and morphologically similar to the genera paradoxurus and paguma the name arctictis means from greek iktis in riau indonesia it was known as tenturun characteristics the binturong is long and heavy with short stout legs it has a thick coat of coarse black hair the bushy and prehensile tail is thick at the root gradually tapering and curls inwards at the tip the muzzle is short and pointed somewhat turned up at the nose and is covered with bristly hairs brown at the points which lengthen as they diverge and form a peculiar radiated circle round the face the eyes are large black and prominent the ears are short rounded edged with white and terminated by tufts of black hair there are six short rounded incisors in each jaw two canines which are long and sharp and six molars on each side the hair on the legs is short and of a yellowish tinge the feet are with large strong claws the soles are bare and applied to the ground throughout the whole of their length the hind ones are longer than the forein general build the binturong is essentially like paradoxurus and paguma but more massive in the length of the tail legs and feet in the structure of the scent glands and larger size of rhinarium which is more convex with a median groove being much narrower above the philtrum the contour hairs of the coat are much longer and coarser and the long hairs clothing the whole of the back of the ears project beyond the tip as a definite tuft the anterior bursa flap of the ears is more widely and less deeply emarginate the tail is more muscular especially at the base and in colour generally like the body but commonly paler at the base beneath the body hairs are frequently partly whitish or buff giving a speckled appearance to the pelage sometimes so pale that the whole body is mostly or grey the young being often at all events paler than the adults but the head is always closely speckled with grey or buff the long mystacial vibrissae are conspicuously white and there is a white rim on the summit of the otherwise black ear the glandular area is whitish the tail is nearly as long as the head and body which ranges from to cm to in the tail is to cm to in long some captive binturongs measured from cm ft in to cm ft in head and body with a tail of cm ft in mean weight of captive adult females is kg lb with a range from to kg to lb captive animals often weigh more than wild counterpartsboth sexes have scent glands females on either side of the vulva and males between the scrotum and penis the musk glands emit an odor reminiscent of popcorn or corn chips likely due to the volatile compound in the urine which is also produced in the maillard reaction at high temperatures unlike most other carnivorans the male binturong does not have a baculum distribution and habitat the binturong occurs from india nepal bangladesh bhutan myanmar thailand malaysia to laos cambodia vietnam and yunnan in china and from sumatra kalimantan and java in indonesia to palawan in the philippines it is confined to tall forest in assam it is common in foothills and hills with good tree cover but less so in the forested plains it has been recorded in manas national park in dulung and kakoi reserved forests of the lakhimpur district in the hill forests of karbi anglong north cachar hills cachar and hailakandi districts in myanmar binturongs were photographed on the ground in tanintharyi nature reserve at an elevation of m ft in the hukaung valley at elevations from m ft in the rakhine yoma elephant reserve at m ft and at three other sites up to m ft elevation in thailand khao yai national park several individuals were observed feeding in a fig tree and on a vine in laos they have been observed in extensive evergreen forest in malaysia binturongs were recorded in secondary forest surrounding a palm estate that was logged in the in palawan it inhabits primary and secondary lowland forest including mosaic from sea level to m ft taxonomy viverra binturong was the scientific name proposed by thomas stamford raffles in for a specimen from malacca the generic name arctictis was proposed by coenraad jacob temminck in in the and centuries the following zoological specimens were described paradoxurus albifrons proposed by frederic cuvier in was based on a drawing of a binturong from bhutan prepared by alfred duvaucel arctictis penicillata by temminck in were specimens from sumatra and java arctictis whitei proposed by joel asaph allen in were skins of two female binturongs collected in palawan island philippines arctictis pageli proposed by ernst schwarz in was a skin and skull of a female collected in northern borneo arctictis gairdneri proposed by oldfield thomas in was a skull of a male binturong collected in southwestern thailand arctictis niasensis proposed by marcus ward lyon jr in was a binturong skin from nias island a b kerkhoveni by henri jacob victor sody in was based on specimens from bangka island a b menglaensis by wang and li in was based on specimens from yunnan provincenine subspecies have been recognized forming two clades the northern clade in mainland asia is separated from the sundaic clade by the isthmus of kra ecology and behavior the binturong is active during the day and at night three sightings in pakke tiger reserve were by day thirteen camera trap photograph events in myanmar involved one around dusk seven in full night and five in broad daylight all photographs were of single animals and all were taken on the ground as binturongs are not very nimble they may have to descend to the ground relatively frequently when moving between treesfive binturongs in the phu khieo wildlife sanctuary exhibited an arrhythmic activity dominated by crepuscular and nocturnal tendencies with peaks in the early morning and late evening reduced inactivity periods occurred from midday to late afternoon they moved between m ft and m ft daily in the dry season and increased their daily movement to m ft in the wet season ranges sizes of males varied between sq mi and sq mi two males showed slightly larger ranges in the wet season their ranges overlapped between the average home range of a female in the khao yai national park was estimated at sq mi and the one of a male at to to sq mi the binturong is essentially arboreal pocock observed the behaviour of several captive individuals in the london zoological gardens when resting they lie curled up with the head tucked under the tail they seldom leaped but climbed skillfully albeit slowly progressing with equal ease and confidence along the upper side of branches or upside down beneath them the prehensile tail was always ready as a help they descended the vertical bars of the cage head first gripping them between their paws and using the prehensile tail as a check when irritated they growled fiercely when on the prowl they periodically uttered a series of low grunts or a hissing sound made by expelling air through partially opened lipsthe binturong uses the tail to communicate it moves about gently often coming to a stop and often using the tail to keep balance clinging to a branch it shows a pronounced comfort behaviour associated with grooming the fur shaking and licking the hair and scratching shaking is the most characteristic element of comfort behaviourthe species is normally quite shy but aggressive when harassed it is reported to initially urinate or defecate on a threat and then if and snarling does not deter the threat it uses its powerful jaws and teeth in when threatened the binturong will usually flee into a nearby tree but as a defense mechanism the binturong may sometimes balance on its tail and flash its claws to appear threatening to potential predators predation on adult binturong is reportedly quite rare by sympatric species like leopard clouded leopard and reticulated python diet the binturong is omnivorous feeding on small mammals birds fish earthworms insects and fruits it also preys on rodents fish and earthworms are likely unimportant items in its diet as it is neither aquatic nor fossorial coming across such prey only when opportunities present themselves since it does not have the attributes of a predatory mammal most of the binturong diet is probably of vegetable matter figs are a major component of its diet captive binturongs are particularly fond of plantains but also eat fowls heads and eggsthe binturong is an important agent for seed dispersal especially for those of the strangler fig because of its ability to scarify the seed tough outer coveringin captivity the binturong diet includes commercially prepared meat mix bananas apples oranges canned peaches and mineral supplement reproduction the average age of sexual maturation is months for females and months for males the estrous cycle of the binturong lasts to days with an average of days gestation lasts to days litter size in captivity varies from one to six young with an average of two young per birth neonates weigh between and g and lb and are often referred to as shruggles fertility lasts until years of agethe maximum known lifespan in captivity is thought to be over years of age threats major threats to the binturong are habitat loss and degradation of forests through logging and conversion of forests to throughout the binturong range habitat loss has been severe in the lowlands of the sundaic part of its range and there is no evidence that the binturong uses the plantations that are largely replacing natural forest in china rampant deforestation and opportunistic logging practices have fragmented suitable habitat or eliminated sites altogether in the philippines it is captured for the wildlife trade and in the south of its range it is also taken for human consumption in laos it is one of the most frequently displayed caged live carnivores and skins are traded frequently in at least vientiane in parts of laos it is considered a delicacy and also traded as a food item to vietnamthe orang asli of malaysia keep binturong as pets conservation india included the binturong in cites appendix iii and in schedule i of the wild life protection act so that it has the highest level of protection in china it is listed as critically endangered it is completely protected in bangladesh and partially in thailand malaysia and vietnam licensed hunting of binturong is allowed in indonesia and it is not protected in bruneiworld binturong day an event dedicated to binturong awareness and conservation takes place yearly every second saturday of may in captivity binturongs are common in zoos and captive individuals represent a source of genetic diversity essential for conservation their geographic origin is either usually unknown or they are offspring of several generations of animals references
