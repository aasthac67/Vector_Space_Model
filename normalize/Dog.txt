the dog canis familiaris when considered a distinct species or canis lupus familiaris when considered a subspecies of the wolf is a domesticated carnivore of the family canidae it is part of the canids and is the most widely abundant terrestrial carnivore the dog and the extant gray wolf are sister taxa as modern wolves are not closely related to the wolves that were first domesticated which implies that the direct ancestor of the dog is extinct the dog was the first species to be domesticated and has been selectively bred over millennia for various behaviors sensory capabilities and physical attributestheir long association with humans has led dogs to be uniquely attuned to human behavior and they are able to thrive on a diet that would be inadequate for other canids dogs vary widely in shape size and colors they perform many roles for humans such as hunting herding pulling loads protection assisting police and military companionship and more recently aiding disabled people and therapeutic roles this influence on human society has given them the sobriquet of man best friend taxonomy in the swedish botanist and zoologist carl linnaeus published in his systema naturae the binomial nomenclature or the naming of species canis is the latin word meaning dog and under this genus he listed the carnivores including domestic dogs wolves and jackals he classified the domestic dog as canis familiaris and on the next page he classified the wolf as canis lupus linnaeus considered the dog to be a separate species from the wolf because of its cauda recurvata its upturning tail which is not found in any other canidin a study of mitochondrial dna indicated that the domestic dog may have originated from multiple grey wolf populations with the dingo and new guinea singing dog breeds having developed at a time when human populations were more isolated from each other in the third edition of mammal species of the world published in the mammalogist w christopher wozencraft listed under the wolf canis lupus its wild subspecies and proposed two additional subspecies familiaris linneaus domestic dog and dingo meyer domestic dog wozencraft included hallstromi the new guinea singing dog as a taxonomic synonym for the dingo wozencraft referred to the mdna study as one of the guides in forming his decision the inclusion of familiaris and dingo under a domestic dog clade has been noted by other mammalogists this classification by wozencraft is debated among zoologistsin a workshop hosted by the survival commission canid specialist group considered the new guinea singing dog and the dingo to be feral dogs canis familiaris and therefore should not be assessed for the iucn red list origin the origin of the domestic dog includes the dog genetic divergence from the wolf its domestication and its development into dog types and dog breeds the dog is a member of the genus canis which forms part of the canids and was the first species and the only large carnivore to have been domesticated genetic studies comparing dogs with modern wolves show reciprocal monophyly separate groups which implies that dogs are not genetically close to any living wolf and that their wild ancestor is extinct an extinct late pleistocene wolf may have been the ancestor of the dog with the dog similarity to the extant grey wolf being the result of genetic admixture between the two in a literature review of canid domestication stated that modern dogs were not descended from the same canis lineage as modern wolves and proposes that dogs may be descended from a pleistocene wolf closer in size to a village dogthe genetic divergence between dogs and wolves occurred between and years ago just before or during the last glacial maximum years ago this timespan represents the upper for the commencement of domestication because it is the time of divergence and not the time of domestication which occurred later one of the most important transitions in human history was the domestication of animals which began with the association between wolves and more than years ago the archaeological record and genetic analysis show the remains of the dog buried beside humans years ago to be the first undisputed dog with disputed remains occurring years ago biology anatomy domestic dogs have been selectively bred for millennia for various behaviors sensory capabilities and physical attributes modern dog breeds show more variation in size appearance and behavior than any other domestic animal dogs are predators and scavengers like many other predatory mammals the dog has powerful muscles large and sharp claws and teeth fused wrist bones a cardiovascular system that supports both sprinting and endurance and teeth for catching and tearing size and weight dogs are highly variable in height and weight the smallest known adult dog was a yorkshire terrier that stood only centimetres inches at the shoulder cm in in length along the and weighed only grams ounces the largest known dog was a saint bernard which weighed kg lb and was cm ft in from the snout to the tail the tallest dog is a great dane that stands cm ft in at the shoulder senses the dog senses include vision hearing sense of smell sense of taste touch and sensitivity to the earth magnetic field another study suggested that dogs can see the earth magnetic field coat the coats of domestic dogs are of two varieties double being common with dogs as well as wolves originating from colder climates made up of a coarse guard hair and a soft down hair or single with the topcoat only breeds may have an occasional blaze stripe or star of white fur on their chest or undersideregarding coat appearance or health the coat can be maintained or affected by multiple nutrients present in the diet see coat dog for more information premature graying can occur in dogs from as early as one year of age this has been shown to be associated with impulsive behaviors anxiety behaviors fear of noise and fear of unfamiliar people or animals tail there are many different shapes for dog tails straight straight up sickle curled or as with many canids one of the primary functions of a dog tail is to communicate their emotional state which can be important in getting along with others in some hunting dogs however the tail is traditionally docked to avoid injuries in some breeds such as the braque du bourbonnais puppies can be born with a short tail or no tail at all differences from wolves despite their close genetic relationship and the ability to there are a number of diagnostic features to distinguish the gray wolves from domestic dogs domesticated dogs are clearly distinguishable from wolves by starch gel electrophoresis of red blood cell acid phosphatase the tympanic bullae are large convex and almost spherical in gray wolves while the bullae of dogs are smaller compressed and slightly crumpled compared with equally sized wolves dogs tend to have smaller skulls and smaller brains the teeth of gray wolves are also proportionately larger than those of dogs dogs have a more domed forehead and a distinctive stop between forehead and nose the temporalis muscle that closes the jaws is more robust in wolves wolves do not have dewclaws on their back legs unless there has been admixture with dogs that had them most dogs lack a functioning gland and enter estrus twice yearly unlike gray wolves which only do so once a year primitive dogs such as dingoes and basenjis retain the yearly estrus cycledogs generally have brown eyes and wolves almost always have amber or light colored eyes the skin of domestic dogs tends to be thicker than that of wolves with some inuit tribes favoring the former for use as clothing due to its greater resistance to wear and tear in harsh weather the paws of a dog are half the size of those of a wolf and their tails tend to curl upwards another trait not found in wolves the dog has developed into hundreds of varied breeds and shows more behavioral and morphological variation than any other land mammal health there are many household plants that are poisonous to dogs and other mammals including begonia poinsettia and aloe verasome breeds of dogs are prone to certain genetic ailments such as elbow and hip dysplasia blindness deafness pulmonic stenosis cleft palate and trick knees two serious medical conditions particularly affecting dogs are pyometra affecting unspayed females of all types and ages and gastric dilatation volvulus bloat which affects the larger breeds or dogs both of these are acute conditions and can kill rapidly dogs are also susceptible to parasites such as fleas ticks mites hookworms tapeworms roundworms and heartworms roundworm species that lives in the heart of dogs a number of common human foods and household ingestibles are toxic to dogs including chocolate solids theobromine poisoning onion and garlic thiosulphate sulfoxide or disulfide poisoning grapes and raisins macadamia nuts xylitol as well as various plants and other potentially ingested materials the nicotine in tobacco can also be dangerous dogs can be exposed to the substance by scavenging through garbage bins or ashtrays and eating cigars and cigarettes signs can be vomiting of large amounts eg from eating cigar butts or diarrhea some other signs are abdominal pain loss of coordination collapse or death dogs are susceptible to theobromine poisoning typically from ingestion of chocolate theobromine is toxic to dogs because although the dog metabolism is capable of breaking down the chemical the process is so slow that for some dogs even small amounts of chocolate can be fatal especially dark chocolate dogs are also vulnerable to some of the same health conditions as humans including diabetes dental and heart disease epilepsy cancer hypothyroidism and arthritis lifespan in a study found that mixed breeds live on average years longer than pure breeds and that increasing was negatively correlated with longevity ie the heavier the dog the shorter its lifespan the typical lifespan of dogs varies widely among breeds but for most the median longevity the age at which half the dogs in a population have died and half are still alive ranges from to years individual dogs may live well beyond the median of their breed the breed with the shortest lifespan among breeds for which there is a questionnaire survey with a reasonable sample size is the dogue de bordeaux with a median longevity of about years but several breeds including miniature bull terriers bloodhounds and irish wolfhounds are nearly as with median longevities of to yearsthe breeds including toy poodles japanese spitz border terriers and tibetan spaniels have median longevities of to years the median longevity of dogs taken as an average of all sizes is one or more years longer than that of purebred dogs when all breeds are averaged the dog was bluey an australian cattle dog who died in at years of age reproduction in domestic dogs sexual maturity happens around six to twelve months of age for both males and females although this can be delayed until up to two years old for some large breeds this is the time at which female dogs will have their first estrous cycle they will experience subsequent estrous cycles semiannually during which the body prepares for pregnancy at the peak of the cycle females will come into estrus being mentally and physically receptive to copulation because the ova survive and are capable of being fertilized for a week after ovulation it is possible for more than one male to sire the same litterfertilization typically occurs days after ovulation days after ovulation the embryo attaches to the uterus and after more days the heart beat is detectabledogs bear their litters roughly to days after fertilization with an average of days although the length of gestation can vary an average litter consists of about six puppies though this number may vary widely based on the breed of dog in general toy dogs produce from one to four puppies in each litter while much larger breeds may average as many as twelve some dog breeds have acquired traits through selective breeding that interfere with reproduction male french bulldogs for instance are incapable of mounting the female for many dogs of this breed the female must be artificially inseminated in order to reproduce neutering neutering refers to the sterilization of animals usually by removal of the male testicles or the female ovaries and uterus in order to eliminate the ability to procreate and reduce sex drive because of the overpopulation of dogs in some countries many animal control agencies such as the american society for the prevention of cruelty to animals aspca advise that dogs not intended for further breeding should be neutered so that they do not have undesired puppies that may later be euthanizedaccording to the humane society of the united states million dogs and cats are euthanized each year in the united states and many more are confined to cages in shelters because there are many more animals than there are homes spaying or castrating dogs helps keep overpopulation down local humane societies spcas and other animal protection organizations urge people to neuter their pets and to adopt animals from shelters instead of purchasing them neutering reduces problems caused by hypersexuality especially in male dogs spayed female dogs are less likely to develop some forms of cancer affecting mammary glands ovaries and other reproductive organs however neutering increases the risk of urinary incontinence in female dogs and prostate cancer in males as well as osteosarcoma hemangiosarcoma cruciate ligament rupture obesity and diabetes mellitus in either sex inbreeding depression a common breeding practice for pet dogs is mating between close relatives eg between and full siblings inbreeding depression is considered to be due largely to the expression of homozygous deleterious recessive mutations outcrossing between unrelated individuals including dogs of different breeds results in the beneficial masking of deleterious recessive mutations in progenyin a study of seven breeds of dogs bernese mountain dog basset hound cairn terrier epagneul breton german shepherd dog leonberger and west highland white terrier it was found that inbreeding decreases litter size and survival another analysis of data on dachshund litters found that as the inbreeding coefficient increased litter size decreased and the percentage of stillborn puppies increased thus indicating inbreeding depression in a study of boxer litters of puppies died before reaching weeks of age stillbirth was the most frequent cause of death followed by infection mortality due to infection increased significantly with increases in inbreeding intelligence behavior and communication intelligence dog intelligence is the ability of the dog to perceive information and retain it as knowledge for applying to solve problems studies of two dogs suggest that dogs can learn by inference and have advanced memory skills a study with rico a border collie showed that he knew the labels of over different items he inferred the names of novel items by exclusion learning and correctly retrieved those novel items immediately and also weeks after the initial exposure a study of another border collie chaser documented his learning and memory capabilities he had learned the names and could associate by verbal command over words dogs are able to read and react appropriately to human body language such as gesturing and pointing and to understand human voice commands a study on canine cognitive abilities found that dogs capabilities are no more exceptional than those of other animals such as horses chimpanzees or cats various animals including pigs pigeons and chimpanzees are able to remember the what where and when of an event which dogs can not dodogs demonstrate a theory of mind by engaging in deception an experimental study showed compelling evidence that australian dingos can outperform domestic dogs in indicating that domestic dogs may have lost much of their original abilities once they joined humans another study indicated that after undergoing training to solve a simple manipulation task dogs that are faced with an insoluble version of the same problem look at the human while socialized wolves do not behavior dog behavior is the internally coordinated responses actions or inactions of the domestic dog individuals or groups to internal external stimuli as the oldest domesticated species with estimates ranging from years bce the minds of dogs inevitably have been shaped by millennia of contact with humans as a result of this physical and social evolution dogs more than any other species have acquired the ability to understand and communicate with humans and they are uniquely attuned to human behaviors behavioral scientists have uncovered a surprising set of abilities in the domestic dog these abilities are not possessed by the dog closest canine relatives nor by other highly intelligent mammals such as great apes but rather parallel some of the skills of human childrenunlike other domestic species which were primarily selected for traits dogs were initially selected for their behaviors in a study found that there were only fixed genes that showed variation between wolves and dogs these gene variations were unlikely to have been the result of natural evolution and indicate selection on both morphology and behavior during dog domestication these genes have been shown to affect the catecholamine synthesis pathway with the majority of the genes affecting the response ie selection for tameness and emotional processing dogs generally show reduced fear and aggression compared with wolves some of these genes have been associated with aggression in some dog breeds indicating their importance in both the initial domestication and then later in breed formation traits of high sociability and lack of fear in dogs may include genetic modifications related to syndrome in humans which cause hypersociability at the expense of problem solving ability communication dog communication is how dogs convey information to other dogs how they understand messages from humans and how humans translate the information that dogs are transmitting communication behaviors of dogs include eye gaze facial expression vocalization body posture including movements of bodies and limbs and gustatory communication scents pheromones and taste humans communicate to dogs by using vocalization hand signals and body posture ecology population in an estimate of the global dog population was between million and million although it is said that the dog is man best friend this refers largely to the of dogs that live in developed countries in the developing world dogs are more commonly feral or communally owned with pet dogs uncommon most of these dogs live their lives as scavengers and have never been owned by humans with one study showing their most common response when approached by strangers is to run away or respond aggressively little is known about these dogs or the dogs in developed countries that are feral stray or are in shelters because the great majority of modern research on dog cognition has focused on pet dogs living in human homes competitors and predators although dogs are the most abundant and widely distributed terrestrial carnivores the potential of feral and dogs to compete with other large carnivores is limited by their strong association with humans for example a review of the studies in the competitive effects of dogs on sympatric carnivores did not mention any research on competition between dogs and wolves although wolves are known to kill dogs they tend to live in pairs or in small packs in areas where they are highly persecuted giving them a disadvantage facing large dog groupswolves kill dogs wherever they are found together one study reported that in wisconsin in more compensation had been paid for losses due to wolves taking dogs than for wolves taking livestock in wisconsin wolves will often kill hunting dogs possibly because the dogs are in the wolf territory a strategy has been reported in russia where one wolf lures a dog into heavy brush where another wolf waits in ambush in some instances wolves have displayed an uncharacteristic fearlessness of humans and buildings when attacking dogs to the extent that they have to be beaten off or killed although the numbers of dogs killed each year are relatively low it induces a fear of wolves entering villages and farmyards to take dogs and losses of dogs to wolves has led to demands for more liberal wolf hunting regulationscoyotes and big cats have also been known to attack dogs leopards in particular are known to have a predilection for dogs and have been recorded to kill and consume them regardless of their size tigers in manchuria indochina indonesia and malaysia are also reported to kill dogs striped hyenas are known to kill dogs in turkmenistan india and the caucasusdogs are normal prey for the american alligator diet dogs have been described as carnivores or omnivores compared to wolves dogs from agricultural societies have extra copies of amylase and other genes involved in starch digestion that contribute to an increased ability to thrive on a diet also like humans some dog breeds produce amylase in their saliva based on metabolism and nutrition many consider the dog to be an omnivorehowever the dog is not simply an omnivore more like the cat and less like other omnivores the dog can only produce bile acid with taurine and it can not produce vitamin d which it obtains from animal flesh also more like the cat the dog requires arginine to maintain its nitrogen balance these nutritional requirements place the dog between carnivores and omnivores range as a domesticated or animal the dog is nearly universal among human societies notable exceptions once included aboriginal tasmanians who were separated from australia before the arrival of dingos on that continent the andamanese who were isolated when rising sea levels covered the land bridge to myanmar the fuegians who instead domesticated the fuegian dog a different canid species certain pacific islands whose maritime settlers did not bring dogs or where dogs died out after original settlement notably the mariana islands palau marshall islands gilbert islands new caledonia vanuatu tonga marquesas mangaia in the cook islands rapa iti in french polynesia easter island chatham islands and pitcairn island settled by the bounty mutineers who killed off their dogs in order to escape discovery by passing ships dogs were introduced to antarctica as sled dogs but were later outlawed by international agreement due to the possible risk of spreading infections breeds the domestic dog is the first species and the only large carnivore known to have been domesticated especially over the past years dogs have undergone rapid phenotypic change and were formed into today modern dog breeds due to artificial selection by humans these breeds can vary in size and weight from a kg lb teacup poodle to a kg lb giant mastiff phenotypic variation can include height measured to the withers ranging from cm in in the chihuahua to cm in in the irish wolfhound color varies from white through grays usually called blue to black and browns from light tan to dark red or chocolate in a wide variation of patterns coats can be short or long to straight curly or smooth the skull body and limb proportions vary significantly between breeds with dogs displaying more phenotypic diversity than can be found within the entire order of carnivores some breeds demonstrate outstanding skills in herding retrieving scent detection and guarding which demonstrates the functional and behavioral diversity of dogs the first dogs were domesticated from shared ancestors of modern wolves however the phenotypic changes that coincided with the genetic divergence are not known roles with humans domestic dogs inherited complex behaviors such as bite inhibition from their wolf ancestors which would have been pack hunters with complex body language these sophisticated forms of social cognition and communication may account for their trainability playfulness and ability to fit into human households and social situations and these attributes have given dogs a relationship with humans that has enabled them to become one of the most successful species on the planet todaythe dogs value to early human led to them quickly becoming ubiquitous across world cultures dogs perform many roles for people such as hunting herding pulling loads protection assisting police and military companionship and more recently aiding handicapped individuals this influence on human society has given them the nickname man best friend in the western world in some cultures however dogs are also a source of meat early roles wolves and their dog descendants likely derived significant benefits from living in human camps more safety more reliable food lesser caloric needs and more chance to breed they would have benefited from humans upright gait that gives them larger range over which to see potential predators and prey as well as better color vision that at least by day gives humans better visual discrimination camp dogs would also have benefited from human tool use as in bringing down larger prey and controlling fire for a range of purposeshumans would also have derived enormous benefit from the dogs associated with their camps for instance dogs would have improved sanitation by cleaning up food scraps dogs may have provided warmth as referred to in the australian aboriginal expression three dog night an exceptionally cold night and they would have alerted the camp to the presence of predators or strangers using their acute hearing to provide an early warningit has been suggested that the most significant benefit would have been the use of dogs robust sense of smell to assist with the hunt the relationship between the presence of a dog and success in the hunt is often mentioned as a primary reason for the domestication of the wolf and a study of hunter groups with and without a dog gives quantitative support to the hypothesis that the benefits of cooperative hunting was an important factor in wolf domesticationthe cohabitation of dogs and humans likely improved the chances of survival for early human groups and the domestication of dogs may have been one of the key forces that led to human successhuman emigrants from siberia that came across the bering land bridge into north america likely had dogs in their company although one writer even suggests that the use of sled dogs may have been critical to the success of the waves that entered north america roughly years ago the earliest archaeological evidence of canids in north america dates from about years ago dogs were an important part of life for the athabascan population in north america and were their only domesticated animal dogs as pack animals may have contributed to the migration of the apache and navajo tribes years ago this use of dogs in these cultures often persisted after the introduction of the horse to north america as pets it is estimated that of the world dog population lives in the developing world as feral village or community dogs with pet dogs uncommon the most widespread form of interspecies bonding occurs between humans and dogs and the keeping of dogs as companions particularly by elites has a long history see the dog populations grew significantly after world war ii as suburbanization increased in the and dogs were kept outside more often than they tend to be today the expression in the doghouse recorded since to describe exclusion from the group implies distance between the doghouse and the home and were still primarily functional acting as a guard children playmate or walking companion from the there have been changes in the role of the pet dog such as the increased role of dogs in the emotional support of their human guardians people and their dogs have become increasingly integrated and implicated in each other lives to the point where pet dogs actively shape the way a family and home are experiencedthere have been two major trends occurring within the second half of the century in the changing status of pet dogs the first has been the commodification of the dog shaping it to conform to human expectations of personality and behaviour the second has been the broadening of the concept of the family and the home to include within everyday routines and practicesa vast range of commodity forms aim to transform a pet dog into an ideal companion the list of goods services and places available is enormous from dog perfumes couture furniture and housing to dog groomers therapists trainers and caretakers dog cafes spas parks and beaches and dog hotels airlines and cemeteries while dog training as an organized activity has operated since the century in the last decades of the century it became a issue as many normal dog behaviors such as barking jumping up digging rolling in dung fighting and urine marking which dogs do to establish territory through scent became increasingly incompatible with the new role of a pet dog dog training books classes and television programs proliferated as the process of commodifying the pet dog continuedthe majority of contemporary describe their pet as part of the family although some ambivalence about the relationship is evident in the popular reconceptualization of the family as a pack some such as on the television program dog whisperer have promoted a of relationships however it has been disputed that trying to achieve status is characteristic of interactions pet dogs play an active role in family life for example a study of conversations in families showed how family members use the dog as a resource talking to the dog or talking through the dog to mediate their interactions with each otherincreasingly human engage in activities centered on the perceived needs and interests of the dog or in which the dog is an integral partner such as dog dancing and dog yogaaccording to statistics published by the american pet products manufacturers association in the national pet owner survey in an estimated million people in the united states have pet dogs the same source shows that nearly of american households own at least one dog of which own just one dog two dogs and nearly more than two dogs there does not seem to be any gender preference among dogs as pets as the statistical data reveal an equal number of female and male dog pets although several programs promote pet adoption less than a fifth of the owned dogs come from a shelter some research suggests that a pet dog produces a considerable carbon footprinta study using magnetic resonance imaging mri to compare humans and dogs showed that dogs have the same response to voices and use the same parts of the brain as humans do this gives dogs the ability to recognize emotional human sounds making them friendly social pets to humans work dogs have lived and worked with humans in many roles in addition to dogs role as companion animals dogs have been bred for herding livestock collies sheepdogs hunting hounds pointers and rodent control terriers other types of working dogs include search and rescue dogs detection dogs trained to detect illicit drugs or chemical weapons guard dogs dogs who assist fishermen with the use of nets and dogs that pull loads in the dog laika became the first animal to be launched into earth orbit aboard the soviets sputnik she died during the flightvarious kinds of service dogs and assistance dogs including guide dogs hearing dogs mobility assistance dogs and psychiatric service dogs provide assistance to individuals with disabilities some dogs owned by epileptics have been shown to alert their handler when the handler shows signs of an impending seizure sometimes well in advance of onset allowing the guardian to seek safety medication or medical care sports and shows people often enter their dogs in competitions such as shows or sports including racing sledding and agility competitions in conformation shows also referred to as breed shows a judge familiar with the specific dog breed evaluates individual purebred dogs for conformity with their established breed type as described in the breed standard as the breed standard only deals with the externally observable qualities of the dog such as appearance movement and temperament separately tested qualities such as ability or health are not part of the judging in conformation shows as food dog meat is consumed in some east asian countries including korea china and vietnam a practice that dates back to antiquity it is estimated that million dogs are killed and consumed in asia every year in china debates have ensued over banning the consumption of dog meat following the sui and tang dynasties of the first millennium however people living on the plains of northern china began to eschew eating dogs this is likely due to the spread of buddhism and islam two religions that forbade the consumption of certain animals including dogs as members of the upper classes shunned dog meat it gradually became a social taboo to eat it despite the fact that the general population continued to consume it for centuries afterward other cultures such as polynesia and mexico also consumed dog meat in their history however western south asian african and middle eastern cultures in general regard consumption of dog meat as taboo in some places however such as in rural areas of poland dog fat is believed to have medicinal properties being good for the lungs for instance dog meat is also consumed in some parts of switzerland proponents of eating dog meat have argued that placing a distinction between livestock and dogs is western hypocrisy and that there is no difference with eating the meat of different animalsin korea the primary dog breed raised for meat the nureongi nureongi differs from those breeds raised for pets that koreans may keep in their homesthe most popular korean dog dish is also called bosintang a spicy stew meant to balance the body heat during the summer months followers of the custom claim this is done to ensure good health by balancing one gi or vital energy of the body a century version of explains that the dish is prepared by boiling dog meat with scallions and chili powder variations of the dish contain chicken and bamboo shoots while the dishes are still popular in korea with a segment of the population dog is not as widely consumed as beef chicken and pork health risks to humans in the who reported that people died in asia and africa from rabies a disease for which dogs are the most important vectorciting a study the us centers for disease control estimated in that million people in the usa are bitten by dogs each year a study estimated that of the us population is bitten each year in the and the us averaged fatalities per year while since this has increased to an average of of dog bites are from the pet of family or friends and of attacks occur on the property of the dog legal ownera colorado study found bites in children were less severe than bites in adults the incidence of dog bites in the us is per inhabitants but for boys aged to the incidence rate is per moreover children have a much higher chance to be bitten in the face or neck sharp claws with powerful muscles behind them can lacerate flesh in a scratch that can lead to serious infectionsin the uk between and there were dog attacks on humans resulting in working days lost in sick leavein the united states cats and dogs are a factor in more than falls each year it has been estimated around of injuries treated in uk hospitals are domestic accidents the same study found that while dog involvement in road traffic accidents was difficult to quantify road accidents involving injury more commonly involved vehiclestoxocara canis dog roundworm eggs in dog feces can cause toxocariasis in the united states about cases of toxocara infection are reported in humans each year and almost of the us population is infected in great britain of soil samples taken from public parks contained t canis eggs untreated toxocariasis can cause retinal damage and decreased vision dog feces can also contain hookworms that cause cutaneous larva migrans in humans health benefits for humans dogs suffer from the same common disorders as humans these includes cancer diabetes heart disease and neurologic disorders the pathology is similar to humans as is their response to treatment and their final outcomes researchers are now identifying the genes associated with dog diseases that are similar to human disorders but which lack mouse models in order to find treatments for both dogs and humans the genes which are involved in canine obsessive compulsive disorders led to the detection of four genes in related pathways in humansthe scientific evidence is mixed as to whether companionship of a dog can enhance human physical health and psychological wellbeing studies suggesting that there are benefits to physical health and psychological wellbeing have been criticised for being poorly controlled and finding that the health of elderly people is related to their health habits and social supports but not to their ownership of or attachment to a companion animal earlier studies have shown that people who keep pet dogs or cats exhibit better mental and physical health than those who do not making fewer visits to the doctor and being less likely to be on medication than paper states recent research has failed to support earlier findings that pet ownership is associated with a reduced risk of cardiovascular disease a reduced use of general practitioner services or any psychological or physical benefits on health for community dwelling older people research has however pointed to significantly less absenteeism from school through sickness among children who live with pets in one study new guardians reported a highly significant reduction in minor health problems during the first month following pet acquisition and this effect was sustained in those with dogs through to the end of the studyin addition people with pet dogs took considerably more physical exercise than those with cats and those without pets the results provide evidence that keeping pets may have positive effects on human health and behaviour and that for guardians of dogs these effects are relatively pet guardianship has also been associated with increased coronary artery disease survival with human guardians being significantly less likely to die within one year of an acute myocardial infarction than those who did not own dogsthe health benefits of dogs can result from contact with dogs in general and not solely from having dogs as pets for example when in the presence of a pet dog people show reductions in cardiovascular behavioral and psychological indicators of anxiety other health benefits are gained from exposure to microorganisms which according to the hygiene hypothesis can protect against allergies and autoimmune diseases the benefits of contact with a dog also include social support as dogs are able to not only provide companionship and social support themselves but also to act as facilitators of social interactions between humans one study indicated that wheelchair users experience more positive social interactions with strangers when they are accompanied by a dog than when they are not in a study found that pet owners were significantly more likely to get to know people in their neighborhood than ownersthe practice of using dogs and other animals as a part of therapy dates back to the late century when animals were introduced into mental institutions to help socialize patients with mental disorders intervention research has shown that therapy with a dog can increase social behaviors such as smiling and laughing among people with alzheimer disease one study demonstrated that children with adhd and conduct disorders who participated in an education program with dogs and other animals showed increased attendance increased knowledge and skill objectives and decreased antisocial and violent behavior compared with those who were not in an program shelters every year between and million dogs and cats enter us animal shelters the humane society of the united states hsus estimates that approximately to million of those dogs and cats are euthanized yearly in the united states however the percentage of dogs in us animal shelters that are eventually adopted and removed from the shelters by their new legal owners has increased since the from around to a average of among reporting shelters with many shelters reporting terminology the term dog typically is applied both to the species or subspecies as a whole and any adult male member of the same an adult female is a bitch an adult male capable of reproduction is a stud an adult female capable of reproduction is a brood bitch or brood mother immature males or females that is animals that are incapable of reproduction are pups or puppies a group of pups from the same gestation period is called a litter the father of a litter is a sire it is possible for one litter to have multiple sires the mother of a litter is a dam a group of any three or more adults is a pack cultural depictions in china korea and japan dogs are viewed as kind protectors mythology and religion in ancient mesopotamia from the old babylonian period until the dogs were the symbol of ninisina the goddess of healing and medicine and her worshippers frequently dedicated small models of seated dogs to her in the and periods dogs were used as emblems of magical protectionin mythology dogs often serve as pets or as watchdogs stories of dogs guarding the gates of the underworld recur throughout mythologies and may originate from religion in greek mythology cerberus is a watchdog who guards the gates of hades in norse mythology a bloody dog called garmr guards helheim in persian mythology two dogs guard the chinvat bridge in welsh mythology annwn is guarded by cwn annwn in hindu mythology yama the god of death owns two watch dogs who have four eyes they are said to watch over the gates of naraka the hunter god muthappan from north malabar region of kerala has a hunting dog as his mount dogs are found in and out of the muthappan temple and offerings at the shrine take the form of bronze dog figurines in philippine mythology kimat who is the pet of tadaklan god of thunder is responsible for lightning the role of the dog in chinese mythology includes a position as one of the twelve animals which cyclically represent years the zodiacal dog three of the constellations in western astronomy also represent dogs canis major the great dog whose brightest star sirius is also called the dog star canis minor the little dog and canes venatici the hunting dogs in christianity dogs represent faithfulness within the roman catholic denomination specifically the iconography of saint dominic includes a dog after the hallow mother dreamt of a dog springing from her womb and becoming pregnant shortly thereafter as such the dominican order ecclesiastical latin dominicanus means dogs of the lord or hounds of the lord ecclesiastical latin domini canis in christian folklore a church grim often takes the form of a black dog to guard christian churches and their churchyards from sacrilegejewish law does not prohibit keeping dogs and other pets jewish law requires jews to feed dogs and other
