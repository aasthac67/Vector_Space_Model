the chicken gallus gallus domesticus is a type of domesticated fowl a subspecies of the red junglefowl gallus gallus chickens are one of the most common and widespread domestic animals with a total population of billion as of up from more than billion in there are more chickens in the world than any other bird or domesticated fowl humans keep chickens primarily as a source of food consuming both their meat and eggs and less commonly as pets originally raised for cockfighting or for special ceremonies chickens were not kept for food until the hellenistic period centuries bc genetic studies have pointed to multiple maternal origins in south asia southeast asia and east asia but with the clade found in the americas europe the middle east and africa originating in the indian subcontinent from ancient india the domesticated chicken spread to lydia in western asia minor and to greece by the century bc fowl had been known in egypt since the century bc with the bird that gives birth every day having come to egypt from the land between syria and shinar babylonia according to the annals of thutmose iii terminology in the uk and ireland adult male chickens over the age of one year are primarily known as cocks whereas in the united states canada australia and new zealand they are more commonly called roosters males less than a year old are cockerels castrated or neutered roosters are called capons surgical and chemical castration are now illegal in some parts of the world females over a year old are known as hens and younger females as pullets although in the industry a pullet becomes a hen when she begins to lay eggs at to weeks of age in australia and new zealand also sometimes in britain there is a generic term chook to describe all ages and both sexes the young are often called chicks chicken originally referred to young domestic fowl the species as a whole was then called domestic fowl or just fowl this use of chicken survives in the phrase hen and chickens sometimes used as a british public house or theatre name and to name groups of one large and many small rocks or islands in the sea see for example hen and chicken islands in the deep south of the united states chickens are referred to by the slang term yardbird general biology and habitat chickens are omnivores in the wild they often scratch at the soil to search for seeds insects and even animals as large as lizards small snakes or young micethe average chicken may live for five to ten years depending on the breed the world oldest known chicken was a hen which died of heart failure at the age of years according to the guinness world recordsroosters can usually be differentiated from hens by their striking plumage of long flowing tails and shiny pointed feathers on their necks hackles and backs saddle which are typically of brighter bolder colours than those of females of the same breed however in some breeds such as the sebright chicken the rooster has only slightly pointed neck feathers the same colour as the hen the identification can be made by looking at the comb or eventually from the development of spurs on the male legs in a few breeds and in certain hybrids the male and female chicks may be differentiated by colour adult chickens have a fleshy crest on their heads called a comb or cockscomb and hanging flaps of skin either side under their beaks called wattles collectively these and other fleshy protuberances on the head and throat are called caruncles both the adult male and female have wattles and combs but in most breeds these are more prominent in males a muff or beard is a mutation found in several chicken breeds which causes extra feathering under the chicken face giving the appearance of a beard domestic chickens are not capable of long distance flight although lighter chickens are generally capable of flying for short distances such as over fences or into trees where they would naturally roost chickens may occasionally fly briefly to explore their surroundings but generally do so only to flee perceived danger behavior social behaviour chickens are gregarious birds and live together in flocks they have a communal approach to the incubation of eggs and raising of young individual chickens in a flock will dominate others establishing a pecking order with dominant individuals having priority for food access and nesting locations removing hens or roosters from a flock causes a temporary disruption to this social order until a new pecking order is established adding hens especially younger birds to an existing flock can lead to fighting and injury when a rooster finds food he may call other chickens to eat first he does this by clucking in a high pitch as well as picking up and dropping the food this behaviour may also be observed in mother hens to call their chicks and encourage them to eat a rooster crowing is a loud and sometimes shrill call and sends a territorial signal to other roosters however roosters may also crow in response to sudden disturbances within their surroundings hens cluck loudly after laying an egg and also to call their chicks chickens also give different warning calls when they sense a predator approaching from the air or on the ground courtship to initiate courting some roosters may dance in a circle around or near a hen a circle dance often lowering the wing which is closest to the hen the dance triggers a response in the hen and when she responds to his call the rooster may mount the hen and proceed with the mating more specifically mating typically involves the following sequence male approaching the hen male waltzing male waltzing female crouching receptive posture or stepping aside or running away if unwilling to copulate male mounting male treading with both feet on hen back male tail bending following successful copulation nesting and laying behaviour hens will often try to lay in nests that already contain eggs and have been known to move eggs from neighbouring nests into their own the result of this behaviour is that a flock will use only a few preferred locations rather than having a different nest for every bird hens will often express a preference to lay in the same location it is not unknown for two or more hens to try to share the same nest at the same time if the nest is small or one of the hens is particularly determined this may result in chickens trying to lay on top of each other there is evidence that individual hens prefer to be either solitary or gregarious nesters broodiness under natural conditions most birds lay only until a clutch is complete and they will then incubate all the eggs hens are then said to go broody the broody hen will stop laying and instead will focus on the incubation of the eggs a full clutch is usually about eggs she will sit or set on the nest protesting or pecking in defense if disturbed or removed and she will rarely leave the nest to eat drink or while brooding the hen maintains the nest at a constant temperature and humidity as well as turning the eggs regularly during the first part of the incubation to stimulate broodiness owners may place several artificial eggs in the nest to discourage it they may place the hen in an elevated cage with an open wire floor breeds artificially developed for egg production rarely go broody and those that do often stop through the incubation however other breeds such as the cochin cornish and silkie do regularly go broody and they make excellent mothers not only for chicken eggs but also for those of other species even those with much smaller or larger eggs and different incubation periods such as quail pheasants turkeys or geese hatching and early life fertile chicken eggs hatch at the end of the incubation period about days development of the chick starts only when incubation begins so all chicks hatch within a day or two of each other despite perhaps being laid over a period of two weeks or so before hatching the hen can hear the chicks peeping inside the eggs and will gently cluck to stimulate them to break out of their shells the chick begins by pipping pecking a breathing hole with its egg tooth towards the blunt end of the egg usually on the upper side the chick then rests for some hours absorbing the remaining egg yolk and withdrawing the blood supply from the membrane beneath the shell used earlier for breathing through the shell the chick then enlarges the hole gradually turning round as it goes and eventually severing the blunt end of the shell completely to make a lid the chick crawls out of the remaining shell and the wet down dries out in the warmth of the nest hens usually remain on the nest for about two days after the first chick hatches and during this time the newly hatched chicks feed by absorbing the internal yolk sac some breeds sometimes start eating cracked eggs which can become habitual hens fiercely guard their chicks and brood them when necessary to keep them warm at first often returning to the nest at night she leads them to food and water and will call them toward edible items but seldom feeds them directly she continues to care for them until they are several weeks old although there are some hens the black hen atriana in the territory of atri that are aggressive and often kill their own chicks they are characterized as a hen that lays mant eggs daily defensive behaviour chickens may occasionally gang up on a weak or inexperienced predator at least one credible report exists of a young fox killed by hens a group of hens have been recorded in attacking a hawk that had entered their coop embryology chicken embryos have long been used as model systems to study developing embryos easy access to the embryos is provided by commercial chicken farmers who sell fertilized eggs which can be easily opened and which allow scientists to observe the developing embryo equally important embryologists can carry out experiments on such embryos close the egg again and study the effect later on for instance many important discoveries in the area of limb development have been made using chicken embryos such as the discovery of the apical ectodermal ridge aer and the zone of polarizing activity zpa by john w saundersin scientists researching the ancestry of birds turned on a chicken recessive gene and found that the embryo jaws initiated formation of teeth like those found in ancient bird fossils john fallon the overseer of the project stated that chickens have retained the ability to make teeth under certain conditions genetics and genomics given its eminent role in farming meat production but also research the house chicken was the first bird genome to be sequenced at gb the chicken genome is considerably smaller than other vertebrate genomes such as the human genome gb the final gene set contained genes including noncoding genes and pseudogenes with a total of genes in annotation release a similar number of genes as in the human genome breeding origins galliformes the order of bird that chickens belong to is directly linked to the survival of birds when all other dinosaurs went extinct water or fowl similar to modern partridges survived the extinction event that killed all birds and dinosaurs some of these evolved into the modern galliformes of which domesticated chickens are a main model they are descended primarily from the red junglefowl gallus gallus and are scientifically classified as the same species as such they can and do freely interbreed with populations of red junglefowl subsequent hybridization of domestic chicken with grey junglefowl sri lankan junglefowl and green junglefowl occurred with at least a gene for yellow skin was incorporated into domestic birds through hybridization with the grey junglefowl g sonneratii in a study published in it was found that chickens shared between of their genome with red junglefowl with domestication period dated to years ago the traditional view is that chickens were first domesticated for cockfighting in asia africa and europe in the last decade there have been a number of genetic studies to clarify the origins according to one early study a single domestication event which took place in what now is the country of thailand gave rise to the modern chicken with minor transitions separating the modern breeds however that study was later found to be based on incomplete data and recent studies point to multiple maternal origins with the clade found in the americas europe middle east and africa originating from the indian subcontinent where a large number of unique haplotypes occur the red junglefowl known as the bamboo fowl in many southeast asian languages is a special bird to take advantage of the large amounts of fruits that are produced during the end of the bamboo seeding cycle to boost its own reproduction in domesticating the chicken humans took advantage of this predisposition for prolific reproduction of the red junglefowl when exposed to large amounts of foodseveral controversies still surround the time chicken was domesticated a recent molecular evidence obtained from study published in reveal that chicken was domesticated years ago though it was previously thought to have been domesticated in southern china in bc based on paleoclimatic assumptions which has now raised doubts from another study that question whether those birds were the ancestors of chickens today majority of the world chicken today may have migrated from the harappan culture of the indus valley eventually the chicken moved to the tarim basin of central asia the chicken reached europe romania turkey greece ukraine about bc introduction into western europe came far later about the millennium bc phoenicians spread chickens along the mediterranean coasts as far as iberia breeding increased under the roman empire and was reduced in the middle ages genetic sequencing of chicken bones from archaeological sites in europe revealed that in the high middle ages chickens became less aggressive and began to lay eggs earlier in the breeding seasonmiddle east traces of chicken go back to a little earlier than bc in syria chickens went southward only in the millennium bc they reached egypt for purposes of cockfighting about bc and became widely bred only in ptolemaic egypt about bc little is known about the chicken introduction into africa it was during the hellenistic period centuries bc in the southern levant that chickens began widely to be domesticated for food this change occurred at least years before domestication of chickens spread to europe three possible routes of introduction in about the early first millennium ad could have been through the egyptian nile valley the east africa or indian trade or from carthage and the berbers across the sahara the earliest known remains are from mali nubia east coast and south africa and date back to the middle of the first millennium addomestic chicken in the americas before western contact is still an ongoing discussion but chickens found only in the americas and asia suggest an asian origin for early american chickensa lack of data from thailand russia the indian subcontinent southeast asia and africa makes it difficult to lay out a clear map of the spread of chickens in these areas better description and genetic analysis of local breeds threatened by extinction may also help with research into this area south america an unusual variety of chicken that has its origins in south america is the araucana bred in southern chile by the mapuche people araucanas some of which are tailless and some of which have tufts of feathers around their ears lay eggs it has long been suggested that they the arrival of european chickens brought by the spanish and are evidence of contacts between asian or pacific oceanic peoples particularly the polynesians and south america in an international team of researchers reported the results of analysis of chicken bones found on the arauco peninsula in chile radiocarbon dating suggested that the chickens were and dna analysis showed that they were related to prehistoric populations of chickens in polynesia these results appeared to confirm that the chickens came from polynesia and that there were transpacific contacts between polynesia and south america before columbus arrival in the americashowever a later report looking at the same specimens concluded a published apparently chilean specimen and six polynesian specimens also cluster with the same asian sequences providing no support for a polynesian introduction of chickens to south america in contrast sequences from two archaeological sites on easter island group with an uncommon haplogroup from indonesia japan and china and may represent a genetic signature of an early polynesian dispersal modeling of the potential marine carbon contribution to the chilean archaeological specimen casts further doubt on claims for chickens and definitive proof will require further analyses of ancient dna sequences and radiocarbon and stable isotope data from archaeological excavations within both chile and polynesia the debate for and against a polynesian origin for south american chickens continued with this paper and subsequent responses in pnas use by humans farming more than billion chickens are reared annually as a source of meat and eggs in the united states alone more than billion chickens are slaughtered each year for meat and more than million chickens are reared for egg productionthe vast majority of poultry are raised in factory farms according to the worldwatch institute percent of the world poultry meat and percent of eggs are produced this way an alternative to intensive poultry farming is farming friction between these two main methods has led to issues of ethical consumerism opponents of intensive farming argue that it harms the environment creates human health risks and is inhumane advocates of intensive farming say that their highly efficient systems save land and food resources owing to increased productivity and that the animals are looked after in environmentally controlled facilities reared for meat chickens farmed for meat are called broilers chickens will naturally live for six or more years but broiler breeds typically take less than six weeks to reach slaughter size a free range or organic broiler will usually be slaughtered at about weeks of age reared for eggs chickens farmed primarily for eggs are called layer hens in total the uk alone consumes more than million eggs per day some hen breeds can produce over eggs per year with the highest authenticated rate of egg laying being eggs in days after months of laying the commercial hen ability starts to decline to the point where the flock is commercially unviable hens particularly from battery cage systems are sometimes infirm or have lost a significant amount of their feathers and their life expectancy has been reduced from around seven years to less than two years in the uk and europe laying hens are then slaughtered and used in processed foods or sold as soup hens in some other countries flocks are sometimes force moulted rather than being slaughtered to this involves complete withdrawal of food and sometimes water for days or sufficiently long to cause a body weight loss of to or up to days under experimental conditions this stimulates the hen to lose her feathers but also some flocks may be several times in more than of all flocks were moulted in the us as pets keeping chickens as pets became increasingly popular in the among urban and suburban residents many people obtain chickens for their egg production but often name them and treat them as any other pet chickens are just like any other pet in that they provide companionship and have individual personalities while many do not cuddle much they will eat from one hand respond to and follow their handlers as well as show affectionchickens are social inquisitive intelligent birds and many find their behaviour entertaining certain breeds such as silkies and many bantam varieties are generally docile and are often recommended as good pets around children with disabilities many people feed chickens in part with kitchen food scraps chickens can carry and transmit salmonella in their dander and feces in the united states the centers for disease control and prevention advise against bringing them indoors or letting small children handle them artificial incubation incubation can successfully occur artificially in machines that provide the correct controlled environment for the developing chick the average incubation period for chickens is days but may depend on the temperature and humidity in the incubator temperature regulation is the most critical factor for a successful hatch variations of more than from the optimum temperature of will reduce hatch rates humidity is also important because the rate at which eggs lose water by evaporation depends on the ambient relative humidity evaporation can be assessed by candling to view the size of the air sac or by measuring weight loss relative humidity should be increased to around in the last three days of incubation to keep the membrane around the hatching chick from drying out after the chick cracks the shell lower humidity is usual in the first days to ensure adequate evaporation the position of the eggs in the incubator can also influence hatch rates for best results eggs should be placed with the pointed ends down and turned regularly at least three times per day until one to three days before hatching if the eggs are turned the embryo inside may stick to the shell and may hatch with physical defects adequate ventilation is necessary to provide the embryo with oxygen older eggs require increased ventilation many commercial incubators are with shelves holding tens of thousands of eggs at a time with rotation of the eggs a fully automated process home incubators are boxes holding from to eggs they are usually electrically powered but in the past some were heated with an oil or paraffin lamp diseases and ailments chickens are susceptible to several parasites including lice mites ticks fleas and intestinal worms as well as other diseases despite the name they are not affected by chickenpox which is generally restricted to humanssome of the diseases that can affect chickens are shown below in religion and mythology since antiquity chickens have been and still are a sacred animal in some cultures and deeply embedded within belief systems and religious worship the term persian bird for the rooster appears to have been given by the greeks after persian contact because of his great importance and his religious use among the persians in indonesia the chicken has great significance during the hindu cremation ceremony a chicken is considered a channel for evil spirits which may be present during the ceremony a chicken is tethered by the leg and kept present at the ceremony for its duration to ensure that any evil spirits present go into the chicken and not the family members the chicken is then taken home and returns to its normal life in ancient greece chickens were not normally used for sacrifices perhaps because they were still considered an exotic animal because of its valor the cock is found as an attribute of ares heracles and athena the alleged last words of socrates as he died from hemlock poisoning as recounted by plato were crito i owe a cock to asclepius will you remember to pay the debt signifying that death was a cure for the illness of life the greeks believed that even lions were afraid of roosters several of aesop fables reference this belief in the new testament jesus prophesied the betrayal by peter jesus answered i tell you peter before the rooster crows today you will deny three times that you know me it happened and peter cried bitterly this made the rooster a symbol for both vigilance and betrayal earlier jesus compares himself to a mother hen when talking about jerusalem o jerusalem jerusalem you who kill the prophets and stone those sent to you how often i have longed to gather your children together as a hen gathers her chicks under her wings but you were not willing in the sixth century pope gregory i declared the rooster the emblem of christianity and another papal enactment of the ninth century by pope nicholas i ordered the figure of the rooster to be placed on every church steeplein many central european folk tales the devil is believed to flee at the first crowing of a rooster in traditional jewish practice a kosher animal is swung around the head and then slaughtered on the afternoon before yom kippur the day of atonement in a ritual called kapparos it is now common practice to cradle the bird and move him or her around the head a chicken or fish is typically used because it is commonly available and small enough to hold the sacrifice of the animal is to receive atonement for the animal symbolically takes on all the person sins in kapparos the meat is then donated to the poor a woman brings a hen for the ceremony while a man brings a rooster although not a sacrifice in the biblical sense the death of the animal reminds the penitent sinner that his or her life is in god hands the talmud speaks of learning courtesy toward one mate from the rooster this might refer to the fact that when a rooster finds something good to eat he calls his hens to eat first a rooster might also come to the aid of a hen if she is attacked the talmud likewise provides us with the statement had the torah not been given to us we would have learned modesty from cats honest toil from ants chastity from doves and gallantry from cocks which may be further understood as to that of the gallantry of cocks being taken in the context of a religious instilling vessel of a girt one of the loins young literal translation that which is stately in his stride and move with stately bearing in the book of proverbs as referenced by michael v fox in his proverbs where sa`adiah ben yosef gaon saadia gaon identifies the definitive trait of a cock girded about the loins in proverbs bible as the honesty of their behavior and their success identifying a spiritual purpose of a religious vessel within that religious instilling schema of purpose and use the chicken is one of the symbols of the chinese zodiac in chinese folk religion a cooked chicken as a religious offering is usually limited to ancestor veneration and worship of village deities vegetarian deities such as the buddha are not recipients of such offerings under some observations an offering of chicken is presented with serious prayer while roasted pork is offered during a joyous celebration in confucian chinese weddings a chicken can be used as a substitute for one who is seriously ill or not available eg sudden death to attend the ceremony a red silk scarf is placed on the chicken head and a close relative of the absent holds the chicken so the ceremony may proceed however this practice is rare today a cockatrice was supposed to have been born from an egg laid by a rooster as well as killed by a rooster call in history an early domestication of chickens in southeast asia is probable since the word for domestic chicken manuk is part of the reconstructed language see austronesian languages chickens together with dogs and pigs were the domestic animals of the lapita culture the first neolithic culture of oceaniathe first pictures of chickens in europe are found on corinthian pottery of the century bc the poet cratinus century bc according to the later greek author athenaeus calls the chicken the persian alarm in aristophanes comedy the birds bc a chicken is called the median bird which points to an introduction from the east pictures of chickens are found on greek red figure and pottery in ancient greece chickens were still rare and were a rather prestigious food for symposia delos seems to have been a center of chicken breeding columella de re rustica about bc chickens were common in sindh after the attacks of aria people these fowls spred from sindh to balakh and iran during attacks and wars between iranian and greeks the chickens of hellanic breed came in iran and about bc hellanic chickens came into sindh through medan the romans used chickens for oracles both when flying ex avibus augury and when feeding auspicium ex tripudiis alectryomancy the hen gallina gave a favourable omen auspicium ratum when appearing from the left cic de div like the crow and the owl for the oracle ex tripudiis according to cicero cic de div any bird could be used in auspice and shows at one point that any bird could perform the tripudium but normally only chickens pulli were consulted the chickens were cared for by the pullarius who opened their cage and fed them pulses or a special kind of soft cake when an augury was needed if the chickens stayed in their cage made noises occinerent beat their wings or flew away the omen was bad if they ate greedily the omen was goodin bc the roman general publius claudius pulcher had his sacred chickens thrown overboard when they refused to feed before the battle of drepana saying if they wo eat perhaps they will drink he promptly lost the battle against the carthaginians and roman ships were sunk back in rome he was tried for impiety and heavily finedin bc the lex faunia forbade fattening hens on grain which was a measure enacted to reduce the demand for grain to get around this the romans castrated roosters capon which resulted in a doubling of size despite the law that was passed in rome that forbade the consumption of fattened chickens it was renewed a number of times but does not seem to have been successful fattening chickens with bread soaked in milk was thought to give especially delicious results the roman gourmet apicius offers recipes for chicken mainly boiled chicken with a sauce all parts of the animal are used the recipes include the stomach liver testicles and even the pygostyle the fatty tail of the chicken where the tail feathers attach the roman author columella gives advice on chicken breeding in the eighth book of his treatise de re rustica on agriculture he identified tanagrian rhodic chalkidic and median commonly misidentified as melian breeds which have an impressive appearance a quarrelsome nature and were used for cockfighting by the greeks de re rustica for farming native roman chickens are to be preferred or a cross between native hens and greek cocks de re rustica dwarf chickens are nice to watch because of their size but have no other advantages according to columella de re rustica the ideal flock consists of birds which can be supervised by one person if someone is watching for stray animals white chickens should be avoided as they are not very fertile and are easily caught by eagles or goshawks one cock should be kept for five hens in the case of rhodian and median cocks that are very heavy and therefore not much inclined to sex only three hens are kept per cock the hens of heavy fowls are not much inclined to brood therefore their eggs are best hatched by normal hens a hen can hatch no more than eggs depending on the time of year and supervise no more than hatchlings eggs that are long and pointed give more male hatchlings rounded eggs mainly female hatchlings de re rustica columella also states that chicken coops should face southeast and lie adjacent to the kitchen as smoke is beneficial for the animals and poultry never thrive so well as in warmth and smoke de re rustica coops should consist of three rooms and possess a hearth dry dust or ash should be provided for according to columella de re rustica chickens should be fed on barley groats small millet and wheat bran if they are cheap wheat itself should be avoided as it is harmful to the birds boiled ryegrass lolium sp and the leaves and seeds of alfalfa medicago sativa l can be used as well grape marc can be used but only when the hens stop laying eggs that is about the middle of november otherwise eggs are small and few when feeding grape marc it should be supplemented with some bran hens start to lay eggs after the winter solstice in warm places around the first of january in colder areas in the middle of february parboiled barley increases their fertility this should be mixed with alfalfa leaves and seeds or vetches or millet if alfalfa is not at hand chickens should receive two cups of barley daily columella advises farmers to slaughter hens that are older than three years those that are productive or are poor of their eggs and particularly those that eat their own and other hens eggs according to aldrovandi capons were produced by burning the hind part of the bowels or loins or spurs with a hot iron the wound was treated with potter chalk for the use of poultry and eggs in the kitchens of ancient rome see roman eating and drinking chickens were spread by polynesian seafarers and reached easter island in the century ad where they were the only domestic animal with the possible exception of the polynesian rat rattus exulans they were housed in extremely solid chicken coops built from stone which was first reported as such to linton
