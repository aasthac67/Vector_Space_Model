cassowaries genus casuarius are ratites flightless birds without a keel on their sternum bone that are native to the tropical forests of new guinea papua new guinea and indonesia east nusa tenggara the maluku islands and northeastern australiathere are three extant species the most common of these the southern cassowary is the and living bird smaller only than the ostrich and emu cassowaries feed mainly on fruit although all species are truly omnivorous and will take a range of other plant food including shoots and grass seeds in addition to fungi invertebrates and small vertebrates cassowaries are very wary of humans but if provoked they are capable of inflicting serious even fatal injuries to both dogs and people the cassowary has often been labeled the world most dangerous bird taxonomy systematics and evolution the genus casuarius was erected by the french scientist mathurin jacques brisson in his ornithologie published in the type species is the southern cassowary casuarius casuarius the swedish naturalist carl linnaeus had introduced the genus casuarius in the sixth edition of his systema naturae published in but linnaeus dropped the genus in the important tenth edition of and put the southern cassowary together with the common ostrich and the greater rhea in the genus struthio as the publication date of linnaeus sixth edition was before the starting point of the international commission on zoological nomenclature brisson and not linnaeus is considered as the authority for the genuscassowaries from malay kasuari are part of the ratite group which also includes the emu rheas ostriches and kiwi as well as the extinct moas and elephant birds three extant species are recognised and one extinct most authorities consider the taxonomic classification above to be monotypic however several subspecies of each have been described and some of them have even been suggested as separate species eg c b papuanus the taxonomic name c b papuanus also may be in need of revision to casuarius bennetti westermanni validation of these subspecies has proven difficult due to individual variations variations the scarcity of specimens the stability of specimens the bright skin of the head and basis of describing several in specimens and the practice of trading live cassowaries for thousands of years some of which are likely to have escaped or deliberately introduced to regions away from their origin the evolutionary history of cassowaries as of all ratites is not well known a fossil species was reported from australia but for reasons of biogeography this assignment is not certain and it might belong to the prehistoric emuarius which were primitive emus all ratites are believed to have originally come from the gondwana which separated around million years ago studies show that ratites continued to evolve after this separation into their modern counterparts description typically all cassowaries are shy birds that are found in the deep forest they are adept at disappearing long before a human knows they were there the southern cassowary of the far north queensland rain forests is not well studied and the northern and dwarf cassowaries even less so females are larger and more brightly coloured than the males adult southern cassowaries are to m ft tall although some females may reach m ft and weigh kg lb all cassowaries have feathers that consist of a shaft and loose barbules they do not have rectrices tail feathers or a preen gland cassowaries have small wings with large remiges these are reduced to stiff keratinous quills resembling porcupine quills with no barbs a claw exists on each second digit of the feet the furcula and coracoid are degenerate and their palatal bones and sphenoid bones touch each other these along with their body are thought to be adaptations to ward off vines thorns and leaves allowing them to run quickly through the rainforest cassowaries have feet with sharp claws the second toe the inner one in the medial position sports a claw that may be mm in long this claw is particularly fearsome since cassowaries sometimes kick humans and other animals with their powerful legs cassowaries can run at up to mph through the dense forest and can jump up to m ft they are good swimmers crossing wide rivers and swimming in the sea all three species have a keratinous casque on their heads that grows with age the casque shape and size up to cm in is casuarius casuarius has the largest and casuarius bennetti the smallest tricorn shape with casuarius unappendiculatus having variations in between contrary to earlier findings the hollow inside of the casque is spanned with fine fibres that are believed to have an acoustic function several functions for the casque have been proposed one is that they are a secondary sexual characteristic other suggested functions include being used to batter through underbrush as a weapon in dominance disputes or for pushing aside leaf litter during foraging the latter three are disputed by biologist andrew mack whose personal observation suggests that the casque amplifies deep soundsearlier research indicates the birds lower their heads when running full tilt through the vegetation brushing saplings aside and occasionally careening into small trees the casque would help protect the skull from such collisions cassowaries eat fallen fruit and consequently spend much time under trees where seeds the size of golfballs or larger fall from heights of up to m ft the casque may protect the head by deflecting falling fruitit also has been speculated that the casques play a role in either sound reception or acoustic communication this is related to a discovery that at least the dwarf cassowary and southern cassowary produce frequency sounds which may aid in communication in dense rainforest the boom vocalisation that cassowaries produce is the bird call known and is at the lower limit of human hearing a cooling function for the very similar casques of guineafowl has been proposed the average lifespan of wild cassowaries is believed to be about to years distribution and habitat cassowaries are native to the humid rainforests of new guinea nearby smaller islands east nusa tenggara the maluku islands and to northeastern australia they will however venture out into palm scrub grassland savanna and swamp forest it is unclear whether some island populations are natural or the result of human trade in young birds behaviour and ecology cassowaries are solitary birds except during courtship and sometimes around ample food supplies the male cassowary defends a territory of about acres for himself and his mate female cassowary have larger territories overlapping those of several males while females move among satellite territories of different males they appear to remain within the same territories for most of their lives mating with the same or closely related males over the course of their life spans courtship and pair bonding rituals begin with the vibratory sounds broadcast by females males approach and run with necks parallel to the ground while making dramatic movements of the head which accentuate the frontal neck region the female approaches drumming slowly the male will crouch upon the ground and the female will either step on the male back for a moment before crouching beside him in preparation for copulation or she may attack this is often the case with the females pursuing the males in ritualistic chasing behaviours that generally terminate in water the male cassowary dives into water and submerges himself up to his upper neck and head the female pursues him into the water where he eventually drives her to the shallows where she crouches making ritualistic motions of her head the two may remain in copulation for extended periods of time in some cases another male may approach and run off the first male he will climb onto her to copulate as well males are far more tolerant of one another than females which do not tolerate the presence of other females reproduction the cassowary breeding season starts in may to june females lay three to eight large bright green or pale eggs in each clutch into a heap of leaf litter prepared by the male the eggs measure about by cm by in only ostrich and emu eggs are larger the male incubates those eggs for days removing or adding litter to regulate the temperature then protects the chicks who stay in the nest for about nine months he defends them fiercely against all potential predators including humans the young males later go off to find a territory of their ownthe female does not care for the eggs or the chicks but rather moves on within her territory to lay eggs in the nests of several other males young cassowaries are brown and have buffy stripes they are often kept as pets in native villages in new guinea where they are permitted to roam like barnyard fowl often they are kept until they become nearly grown and someone gets hurt mature cassowaries are placed beside native houses in cribs hardly larger than the birds themselves garbage and other vegetable food is fed to them and they live for years in such enclosures in some areas their plumage is still as valuable as shell money caged birds are regularly bereft of their fresh plumes diet cassowaries are predominantly frugivorous but omnivorous opportunistically when small prey is available besides fruits their diet includes flowers fungi snails insects frogs birds fish rats mice and carrion fruit from at least plant families has been documented in the diet of cassowaries fruits from the laurel podocarp palm wild grape nightshade and myrtle families are important items in the diet the cassowary plum takes its name from the bird where trees are dropping fruit cassowaries will come in and feed with each bird defending a tree from others for a few days they move on when the fruit is depleted fruit even items as large as bananas and apples is swallowed whole cassowaries are a keystone species of rain forests because they eat fallen fruit whole and distribute seeds across the jungle floor via excrementas for eating the cassowary it is supposed to be quite tough australian administrative officers stationed in new guinea were advised that it should be cooked with a stone in the pot when the stone is ready to eat so is the cassowary role in seed dispersal and germination cassowaries feed on the fruit of several hundred rainforest species and usually pass viable seeds in large dense scats they are known to disperse seeds over distances greater than a kilometre and thus play an important role in the ecosystem germination rates for seeds of the rare australian rainforest tree ryparosa were found to be much higher after passing through a cassowary gut versus status and conservation the southern cassowary is endangered in queensland kofron and chapman assessed the decline of this species they found that of the former cassowary habitat only remains they stated that habitat loss and fragmentation is the primary cause of decline they then studied cases of cassowary mortality and found that motor vehicle strikes accounted for of the deaths and dog attacks produced another remaining causes of death included hunting cases entanglement in wire case the removal of cassowaries that attacked humans cases and natural causes cases including tuberculosis cases the cause for cases were indicated as for unknown reasonshand feeding of cassowaries poses a significant threat to their survival because it lures them into suburban areas there the birds are more susceptible to encounters with vehicles and dogs contact with humans encourages cassowaries to take food from picnic tables feral pigs also are a significant threat to their survival they destroy nests and eggs of cassowaries but their worst effect is as competitors for food which may be catastrophic for the cassowaries during lean times in february cyclone yasi destroyed a large area of cassowary habitat endangering of the birds approximately of the total australian populationthe mission beach community in far north queensland holds an annual cassowary festival in september where funds are raised to map the mission beach cassowary corridor in captivity the cassowary has solitary habits and breeds less frequently in zoos than other ratites such as ostrich and emu unlike other ratites it lives exclusively in tropical rainforest and it is important to recreate this habitat carefully unlike the emu which will live with other sympatric species such as kangaroos in mixed australian fauna displays the cassowary does not cohabit well among its own kind individual specimens must even be kept in separate enclosures due to their solitary and aggressive nature territoriality is one of their most important characteristics the cassowary casuarius casuarius is the most popular species in captivity and it is fairly common in european and american zoos where it is known for its unmistakable appearance as of only weltvogelpark walsrode in germany has all three species of cassowary in its collection cassowary casuarius unappendiculatus and bennett cassowary casuarius bennetti both of which are endemic to the tropical rainforest of new guinea and the dwarf cassowary the smallest species if subspecies are recognised weltvogelpark walsrode has casuarius bennettii westermanni and casuarius unappendiculatus rufotinctus relationship with humans some new guinea highlands societies capture cassowary chicks and raise them as poultry for use in ceremonial gift exchanges and as food they are the only indigenous australasian animal known to have been partly domesticated by people prior to european arrival the maring people of kundagai sacrificed cassowaries c bennetti in certain rituals the kalam people considered themselves related to cassowaries and did not classify them as birds but as kin attacks cassowaries have a reputation for being dangerous to people and domestic animals during world war ii american and australian troops stationed in new guinea were warned to steer clear of them in his book living birds of the world ornithologist ernest thomas gilliard wrote the inner or second of the three toes is fitted with a long straight murderous nail which can sever an arm or eviscerate an abdomen with ease there are many records of natives being killed by this bird this assessment of the danger posed by cassowaries has been repeated in print by authors including gregory s paul and jared diamond a historical study of cassowary attacks showed that had been against humans of these had been from cassowaries that had been fed by people of the time the bird had chased or charged the victim of the time they kicked of the attacks involved the birds expecting or snatching food involved defending their natural food sources involved defending themselves from attack and involved defending their chicks or eggs only one human death was reported among those attacksthe first documented human death caused by a cassowary was on april in australia phillip mcclean and his brother age came across a cassowary on their property and decided to try and kill it by striking it with clubs the bird kicked the younger boy who fell and ran away as his older brother struck the bird the older mcclean then tripped and fell to the ground while he was on the ground the cassowary kicked him in the neck opening a cm in wound that may have severed his jugular vein the boy died of his injuries shortly thereaftercassowary strikes to the abdomen are among the rarest of all but there is one case of a dog that was kicked in the belly in the blow left no puncture but there was severe bruising the dog later died from an apparent intestinal ruptureanother human death due to a cassowary was recorded in florida on april the bird owner a man who had raised the animal was apparently clawed to death
