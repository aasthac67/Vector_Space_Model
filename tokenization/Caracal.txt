The caracal ( Caracal caracal ) is a medium-sized wild cat native to Africa , the Middle East , Central Asia , and India . It is characterised by a robust build , long legs , a short face , long tufted ears , and long canine teeth . Its coat is uniformly reddish tan or sandy , while the ventral parts are lighter with small reddish markings . It reaches 40–50 cm ( 16–20 in ) at the shoulder and weighs 8–19 kg ( 18–42 lb ) . It was first scientifically described by German naturalist Johann Christian Daniel von Schreber in 1776 . Three subspecies are recognised . Typically nocturnal , the caracal is highly secretive and difficult to observe . It is territorial , and lives mainly alone or in pairs . The caracal is a carnivore that typically preys upon small mammals , birds , and rodents . It can leap higher than 4 metres ( 12 ft ) and catch birds in midair . It stalks its prey until it is within 5 m ( 16 ft ) of it , after which it runs it down and kills its prey with a bite to the throat or to the back of the neck . Both sexes become sexually mature by the time they are one year old and breed throughout the year . Gestation lasts between two and three months , resulting in a litter of one to six kittens . Juveniles leave their mothers at the age of nine to ten months , though a few females stay back with their mothers . The average lifespan of captive caracals is nearly 16 years . Caracals were tamed and used for hunting in ancient Egypt . Taxonomy and phylogeny Felis caracal was the scientific name used by Johann Christian Daniel von Schreber in 1776 who described a caracal skin from the Cape of Good Hope . In 1843 , British zoologist John Edward Gray placed it in the genus Caracal . It is placed in the family Felidae and subfamily Felinae.In the 19th and 20th centuries , several caracal specimens were described and proposed as subspecies . Since 2017 , three subspecies are recognised as valid : Southern caracal ( C. c. caracal ) ( Schreber , 1776 ) – occurs in Southern and East Africa Northern caracal ( C. c. nubicus ) ( Fischer , 1829 ) – occurs in North and West Africa Asiatic caracal ( C. c. schmitzi ) ( Matschie , 1912 ) – occurs in Asia Phylogeny Results of a phylogenetic study indicates that the caracal and the African golden cat ( Caracal aurata ) diverged between 2.93 and 1.19 million years ago . These two species together with the serval ( Leptailurus serval ) form the Caracal lineage , which diverged between 11.56 and 6.66 million years ago . The ancestor of this lineage arrived in Africa between 8.5 and 5.6 million years ago.The relationship of the caracal is considered as follows : Etymology The name 'caracal ' was proposed by Georges Buffon in 1761 who referred to its Turkish name 'Karrah-kulak ' or 'Kara-coulac ' , meaning 'cat with black ears ' . The 'lynx ' of the Greeks and Romans was most probably the caracal , and the name 'lynx ' is sometimes still applied to it , but the present-day lynx proper is a separate genus.The caracal is also known as desert lynx and Persian lynx . Local names Its name in the Tigrinya language is ጭክ ኣንበሳ ( ch ’ ok anbessa ) , which means 'bearded lion ' . Characteristics The caracal is a slender , moderately sized cat characterised by a robust build , a short face , long canine teeth , tufted ears , and long legs . It reaches nearly 40–50 cm ( 16–20 in ) at the shoulder . The tan , bushy tail extends to the hocks . The caracal is sexually dimorphic ; the females are smaller than the males in most bodily parameters.The prominent facial features include the 4.5-cm-long black tufts on the ears , two black stripes from the forehead to the nose , the black outline of the mouth , the distinctive black facial markings , and the white patches surrounding the eyes and the mouth . The eyes appear to be narrowly open due to the lowered upper eyelid , probably an adaptation to shield the eyes from the sun 's glare . The ear tufts may start drooping as the animal ages . The coat is uniformly reddish tan or sandy , though black caracals are also known . The underbelly and the insides of the legs are lighter , often with small reddish markings . The fur , soft , short , and dense , grows coarser in the summer . The ground hairs ( the basal layer of hair covering the coat ) are denser in winter than in summer . The length of the guard hairs ( the hair extending above the ground hairs ) can be up to 3 cm ( 1.2 in ) long in winter , but shorten to 2 cm ( 0.8 in ) in summer . These features indicate the onset of moulting in the hot season , typically in October and November . The hind legs are longer than the forelegs , so the body appears to be sloping downward from the rump.Male caracals measure in head-to-body length 78–108 cm ( 31–43 in ) and have 21–34 cm ( 8.3–13.4 in ) long tails ; 77 male caracals ranged in weight between 7.2 and 19 kg ( 16 and 42 lb ) . The head-to-body length of females is 71–102.9 cm ( 28.0–40.5 in ) with a tail of 18–31.5 cm ( 7.1–12.4 in ) ; 63 females ranged in weight between 7 and 15.9 kg ( 15 and 35 lb ) .The caracal is often confused with the lynx , as both cats have tufted ears . However , a notable point of difference between the two is that the lynx is spotted and blotched , while the caracal shows no such markings on the coat . The African golden cat has a similar build as the caracal 's , but is darker and lacks the ear tufts . The sympatric serval can be distinguished from the caracal by the former 's lack of ear tufts , white spots behind the ears , spotted coat , longer legs , longer tail , and smaller footprints.The skull of the caracal is high and rounded , featuring large auditory bullae , a well-developed supraoccipital crest normal to the sagittal crest , and a strong lower jaw . The caracal has a total of 30 teeth ; the dental formula is 3.1.3.13.1.2.1 . The deciduous dentition is 3.1.23.1.2 . The striking canines are up to 2 cm ( 0.8 in ) long , heavy , and sharp ; these are used to give the killing bite to the prey . The caracal lacks the second upper premolars , and the upper molars are diminutive . The large paws , similar to those of the cheetah , consist of four digits in the hind legs and five in the fore legs . The first digit of the fore leg remains above the ground and features the dewclaw . The claws , sharp and retractable ( able to be drawn in ) , are larger but less curved in the hind legs . Distribution and habitat In Africa , the caracal is widely distributed south of the Sahara , but considered rare in North Africa . In Asia , it occurs from the Arabian Peninsula , Middle East , Turkmenistan , Uzbekistan to western India . It inhabits forests , savannas , marshy lowlands , semideserts , and scrub forests , but prefers dry areas with low rainfall and availability of cover . In montane habitats such as the Ethiopian Highlands , it occurs up to an altitude of 3,000 m ( 9,800 ft ) .In Ethiopia 's Degua Tembien massif , they can be seen along roads , sometimes as road kills.In the Emirate of Abu Dhabi , a male caracal was recorded by camera-traps in Jebel Hafeet National Park in the Al-Ain Region , Abu Dhabi in February 2019 , the first such record since 1984.In Uzbekistan , caracals were recorded only in the desert regions of the Ustyurt Plateau and Kyzylkum Desert . Between 2000 and 2017 , 15 individuals were sighted alive , and at least 11 were killed by herders.In Iran , the caracal has been recorded in Abbasabad Naein Reserve , Bahram ’ gur Protected Area , Kavir National Park and in Yazd Province.In India , the caracal occurs in Sariska Tiger Reserve and Ranthambhore Tiger Reserve . Ecology and behaviour The caracal is typically nocturnal ( active at night ) , though some activity may be observed during the day as well . However , the cat is so secretive and difficult to observe that its activity at daytime might easily go unnoticed . A study in South Africa showed that caracals are most active when the air temperature drops below 20 °C ( 68 °F ) ; activity typically ceases at higher temperatures . A solitary cat , the caracal mainly occurs alone or in pairs ; the only groups seen are of mothers with their offspring . Females in oestrus temporarily pair with males . A territorial animal , the caracal marks rocks and vegetation in its territory with urine and probably with dung , which is not covered with soil . Claw scratching is prominent , and dung middens are typically not formed . In Israel , males are found to have territories averaging 220 km2 ( 85 sq mi ) , while that of females averaged 57 km2 ( 22 sq mi ) . The male territories vary from 270–1,116 km2 ( 104–431 sq mi ) in Saudi Arabia . In Mountain Zebra National Park , the home ranges of females vary between 4.0 and 6.5 km2 ( 1.5 and 2.5 sq mi ) . These territories overlap extensively . The conspicuous ear tufts and the facial markings often serve as a method of visual communication ; caracals have been observed interacting with each other by moving the head from side to side so that the tufts flicker rapidly . Like other cats , the caracal meows , growls , hisses , spits , and purrs . Diet and hunting A carnivore , the caracal typically preys upon small mammals , birds , and rodents . Studies in South Africa have reported that it preys on the Cape grysbok , the common duiker , sheep , goats , bush vlei rats , rock hyraxes , hares , and birds . A study in western India showed that rodents comprise a significant portion of the diet . They will feed from a variety of sources , but tend to focus on the most abundant one . Grasses and grapes are taken occasionally to clear their immune system and stomach of any parasites . Larger antelopes such as young kudu , bushbuck , impala , mountain reedbuck , and springbok may also be targeted . Mammals generally comprise at least 80 % of the diet . Lizards , snakes , and insects are infrequently eaten . In South Africa , caracals have been documented preying on small livestock in areas where sheep and goat are farmed . Livestock is however only a small and seasonal portion of their diet when wild prey is scarce.Its speed and agility make it an efficient hunter , able to take down prey two to three times its size . The powerful hind legs allow it to leap more than 3 m ( 10 ft ) in the air to catch birds on the wing . It can even twist and change its direction mid-air . It is an adroit climber . It stalks its prey until it is within 5 m ( 16 ft ) , following which it can launch into a sprint . While large prey such as antelopes are suffocated by a throat bite , smaller prey are killed by a bite on the back of the neck . Kills are consumed immediately , and less commonly dragged to cover . It returns to large kills if undisturbed . It has been observed to begin feeding on antelope kills at the hind parts . It may scavenge at times , though this has not been frequently observed . It often has to compete with foxes , wolves , leopards , and hyaena for prey . Reproduction Both sexes become sexually mature by the time they are a year old ; production of gametes begins even earlier at seven to ten months . However , successful mating takes place only at 12 to 15 months . Breeding takes place throughout the year . Oestrus , one to three days long , recurs every two weeks unless the female is pregnant . Females in oestrus show a spike in urine-marking , and form temporary pairs with males . Mating has not been extensively studied ; a limited number of observations suggest that copulation , that lasts nearly four minutes on an average , begins with the male smelling the areas urine-marked by the female , which rolls on the ground . Following this , he approaches and mounts the female . The pair separate after copulation.Gestation lasts about two to three months , following which a litter consisting of one to six kittens is born . Births generally peak from October to February . Births take place in dense vegetation or deserted burrows of aardvarks and porcupines . Kittens are born with their eyes and ears shut and the claws not retractable ( unable to be drawn inside ) ; the coat resembles that of adults , but the abdomen is spotted . Eyes open by ten days , but it takes longer for the vision to become normal . The ears become erect and the claws become retractable by the third or the fourth week . Around the same time , the kittens start roaming their birthplace , and start playing among themselves by the fifth or the sixth week . They begin taking solid food around the same time ; they have to wait for nearly three months before they make their first kill . As the kittens start moving about by themselves , the mother starts shifting them every day . All the milk teeth appear in 50 days , and permanent dentition is completed in 10 months . Juveniles begin dispersing at nine to ten months , though a few females stay back with their mothers . The average lifespan of the caracal in captivity is nearly 16 years.In the 1990s , a captive caracal spontaneously mated with a domestic cat in the Moscow Zoo , resulting in a felid hybrid offspring . Threats The caracal is listed as Least Concern on the IUCN Red List since 2002 , as it is widely distributed in over 50 range countries , where the threats to caracal populations vary in extent . Habitat loss due to agricultural expansion , the building of roads and settlements is a major threat in all range countries . It is thought to be close to extinction in North Africa , Critically Endangered in Pakistan , Endangered in Jordan , but stable in central and Southern Africa . Local people kill caracal to protect livestock , or in retaliation for its preying on small livestock . Additionally , it is threatened by hunting for the pet trade on the Arabian Peninsula . In Turkey and Iran , caracals are frequently killed in road accidents . In Uzbekistan , the major threat to caracal is killing by herders in retaliation for livestock losses . Guarding techniques and sheds are inadequate to protect small livestock like goats and sheep from being attacked by predators . Additionally , similarly to Ethiopia , heavy-traffic roads crossing caracal habitat pose a potential threat for the species . Conservation African caracal populations are listed under CITES Appendix II , while Asian populations come under CITES Appendix I . Hunting of caracal is prohibited in Afghanistan , Algeria , Egypt , India , Iran , Israel , Jordan , Kazakhstan , Lebanon , Morocco , Pakistan , Syria , Tajikistan , Tunisia , Turkey , Turkmenistan , and Uzbekistan . Caracals occur in a number of protected areas across their range.In South Africa , the caracal is considered Least Concern , as it is widespread and adaptable to a variety of habitats . It is tolerant to human-dominated areas , although it has been persecuted for many decades . Farmers are encouraged to report sightings of caracals , both dead and alive , as well as livestock killed by caracals to the national Predation Management Information Centre.The Central Asian caracal population is listed as Critically Endangered in Uzbekistan since 2009 , and in Kazakhstan since 2010 . In culture Chinese emperors used caracals as gifts . In the 13th and the 14th centuries , Yuan dynasty rulers bought numerous caracals , cheetahs , and tigers from Muslim merchants in the western parts of the empire in return for gold , silver , cash , and silk . According to the Ming Shilu , the subsequent Ming dynasty continued this practice . Until as recently as the 20th century , the caracal was used in hunts by Indian rulers to hunt small game , while the cheetah was used for larger game . In those times , caracals were exposed to a flock of pigeons and people would bet on which caracal would kill the largest number of pigeons . This probably gave rise to the expression `` to put the cat among the pigeons '' .The caracal appears to have been religiously significant in the ancient Egyptian culture , as it occurs in paintings and as bronze figurines ; sculptures are thought to have guarded the tombs of pharaohs . Embalmed caracals have also been discovered . Its pelt was used for making fur coats . References External links '' Caracal '' . IUCN Cat Specialist Group .
