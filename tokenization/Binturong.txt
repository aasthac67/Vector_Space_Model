The binturong ( bin-TOO-rong ) ( Arctictis binturong ) , also known as bearcat , is a viverrid native to South and Southeast Asia . It is uncommon in much of its range , and has been assessed as Vulnerable on the IUCN Red List because of a declining population trend that is estimated at more than 30 % since the mid 1980s.The binturong was first described by Thomas Stamford Raffles in 1822 . The genus Arctictis is monotypic and morphologically similar to the genera Paradoxurus and Paguma . The name Arctictis means 'bear-weasel ' , from Greek arkt- 'bear ' + iktis 'weasel ' . In Riau , Indonesia it was known as tenturun . Characteristics The binturong is long and heavy , with short , stout legs . It has a thick coat of coarse black hair . The bushy and prehensile tail is thick at the root , gradually tapering , and curls inwards at the tip . The muzzle is short and pointed , somewhat turned up at the nose , and is covered with bristly hairs , brown at the points , which lengthen as they diverge , and form a peculiar radiated circle round the face . The eyes are large , black and prominent . The ears are short , rounded , edged with white , and terminated by tufts of black hair . There are six short rounded incisors in each jaw , two canines , which are long and sharp , and six molars on each side . The hair on the legs is short and of a yellowish tinge . The feet are five-toed , with large strong claws ; the soles are bare , and applied to the ground throughout the whole of their length ; the hind ones are longer than the fore.In general build the binturong is essentially like Paradoxurus and Paguma but more massive in the length of the tail , legs and feet , in the structure of the scent glands and larger size of rhinarium , which is more convex with a median groove being much narrower above the philtrum . The contour hairs of the coat are much longer and coarser , and the long hairs clothing the whole of the back of the ears project beyond the tip as a definite tuft . The anterior bursa flap of the ears is more widely and less deeply emarginate . The tail is more muscular , especially at the base , and in colour generally like the body , but commonly paler at the base beneath . The body hairs are frequently partly whitish or buff , giving a speckled appearance to the pelage , sometimes so pale that the whole body is mostly straw-coloured or grey , the young being often at all events paler than the adults , but the head is always closely speckled with grey or buff . The long mystacial vibrissae are conspicuously white , and there is a white rim on the summit of the otherwise black ear . The glandular area is whitish . The tail is nearly as long as the head and body , which ranges from 71 to 84 cm ( 28 to 33 in ) ; the tail is 66 to 69 cm ( 26 to 27 in ) long . Some captive binturongs measured from 76 cm ( 2 ft 6 in ) to 91 cm ( 3 ft ) in head and body with a tail of 71 cm ( 2 ft 4 in ) . Mean weight of captive adult females is 21.9 kg ( 48 lb ) with a range from 11 to 32 kg ( 24 to 71 lb ) . Captive animals often weigh more than wild counterparts.Both sexes have scent glands ; females on either side of the vulva , and males between the scrotum and penis . The musk glands emit an odor reminiscent of popcorn or corn chips , likely due to the volatile compound 2-acetyl-1-pyrroline in the urine , which is also produced in the Maillard reaction at high temperatures . Unlike most other carnivorans , the male binturong does not have a baculum . Distribution and habitat The binturong occurs from India , Nepal , Bangladesh , Bhutan , Myanmar , Thailand , Malaysia to Laos , Cambodia , Vietnam and Yunnan in China , and from Sumatra , Kalimantan and Java in Indonesia to Palawan in the Philippines . It is confined to tall forest . In Assam , it is common in foothills and hills with good tree cover , but less so in the forested plains . It has been recorded in Manas National Park , in Dulung and Kakoi Reserved Forests of the Lakhimpur district , in the hill forests of Karbi Anglong , North Cachar Hills , Cachar and Hailakandi Districts . In Myanmar , binturongs were photographed on the ground in Tanintharyi Nature Reserve at an elevation of 60 m ( 200 ft ) , in the Hukaung Valley at elevations from 220–280 m ( 720–920 ft ) , in the Rakhine Yoma Elephant Reserve at 580 m ( 1,900 ft ) and at three other sites up to 1,190 m ( 3,900 ft ) elevation . In Thailand 's Khao Yai National Park , several individuals were observed feeding in a fig tree and on a vine . In Laos , they have been observed in extensive evergreen forest . In Malaysia , binturongs were recorded in secondary forest surrounding a palm estate that was logged in the 1970s . In Palawan , it inhabits primary and secondary lowland forest , including grassland–forest mosaic from sea level to 400 m ( 1,300 ft ) . Taxonomy Viverra binturong was the scientific name proposed by Thomas Stamford Raffles in 1822 for a specimen from Malacca . The generic name Arctictis was proposed by Coenraad Jacob Temminck in 1824 . In the 19th and 20th centuries , the following zoological specimens were described : Paradoxurus albifrons proposed by Frédéric Cuvier in 1822 was based on a drawing of a binturong from Bhutan prepared by Alfred Duvaucel . Arctictis penicillata by Temminck in 1835 were specimens from Sumatra and Java . Arctictis whitei proposed by Joel Asaph Allen in 1910 were skins of two female binturongs collected in Palawan island , Philippines . Arctictis pageli proposed by Ernst Schwarz in 1911 was a skin and skull of a female collected in northern Borneo . Arctictis gairdneri proposed by Oldfield Thomas in 1916 was a skull of a male binturong collected in southwestern Thailand . Arctictis niasensis proposed by Marcus Ward Lyon Jr. in 1916 was a binturong skin from Nias island . A. b. kerkhoveni by Henri Jacob Victor Sody in 1936 was based on specimens from Bangka Island . A. b. menglaensis by Wang and Li in 1987 was based on specimens from Yunnan province.Nine subspecies have been recognized forming two clades . The northern clade in mainland Asia is separated from the Sundaic clade by the Isthmus of Kra . Ecology and behavior The Binturong is active during the day and at night . Three sightings in Pakke Tiger Reserve were by day . Thirteen camera trap photograph events in Myanmar involved one around dusk , seven in full night and five in broad daylight . All photographs were of single animals , and all were taken on the ground . As binturongs are not very nimble , they may have to descend to the ground relatively frequently when moving between trees.Five radio-collared binturongs in the Phu Khieo Wildlife Sanctuary exhibited an arrhythmic activity dominated by crepuscular and nocturnal tendencies with peaks in the early morning and late evening . Reduced inactivity periods occurred from midday to late afternoon . They moved between 25 m ( 82 ft ) and 2,698 m ( 8,852 ft ) daily in the dry season and increased their daily movement to 4,143 m ( 13,593 ft ) in the wet season . Ranges sizes of males varied between 0.9 km2 ( 0.35 sq mi ) and 6.1 km2 ( 2.4 sq mi ) . Two males showed slightly larger ranges in the wet season . Their ranges overlapped between 30–70 % . The average home range of a radio-collared female in the Khao Yai National Park was estimated at 4 km2 ( 1.5 sq mi ) , and the one of a male at 4.5 to 20.5 km2 ( 1.7 to 7.9 sq mi ) .The binturong is essentially arboreal . Pocock observed the behaviour of several captive individuals in the London Zoological Gardens . When resting they lie curled up , with the head tucked under the tail . They seldom leaped , but climbed skillfully , albeit slowly , progressing with equal ease and confidence along the upper side of branches or , upside down , beneath them . The prehensile tail was always ready as a help . They descended the vertical bars of the cage head first , gripping them between their paws and using the prehensile tail as a check . When irritated they growled fiercely . When on the prowl they periodically uttered a series of low grunts or a hissing sound made by expelling air through partially opened lips.The binturong uses the tail to communicate . It moves about gently , often coming to a stop , and often using the tail to keep balance , clinging to a branch . It shows a pronounced comfort behaviour associated with grooming the fur , shaking and licking the hair , and scratching . Shaking is the most characteristic element of comfort behaviour.The species is normally quite shy , but aggressive when harassed . It is reported to initially urinate or defecate on a threat and then , if teeth-baring and snarling does not deter the threat , it uses its powerful jaws and teeth in self-defense . When threatened , the binturong will usually flee into a nearby tree , but as a defense mechanism the binturong may sometimes balance on its tail and flash its claws to appear threatening to potential predators . Predation on adult binturong is reportedly quite rare by sympatric species like leopard , clouded leopard and reticulated python . Diet The binturong is omnivorous , feeding on small mammals , birds , fish , earthworms , insects and fruits . It also preys on rodents . Fish and earthworms are likely unimportant items in its diet , as it is neither aquatic nor fossorial , coming across such prey only when opportunities present themselves . Since it does not have the attributes of a predatory mammal , most of the binturong 's diet is probably of vegetable matter . Figs are a major component of its diet . Captive binturongs are particularly fond of plantains , but also eat fowls ' heads and eggs.The binturong is an important agent for seed dispersal , especially for those of the strangler fig , because of its ability to scarify the seed 's tough outer covering.In captivity , the binturong 's diet includes commercially prepared meat mix , bananas , apples , oranges , canned peaches and mineral supplement . Reproduction The average age of sexual maturation is 30.4 months for females and 27.7 months for males . The estrous cycle of the binturong lasts 18 to 187 days , with an average of 82.5 days . Gestation lasts 84 to 99 days . Litter size in captivity varies from one to six young , with an average of two young per birth . Neonates weigh between 283.8 and 340.5 g ( 0.626 and 0.751 lb ) , and are often referred to as shruggles . Fertility lasts until 15 years of age.The maximum known lifespan in captivity is thought to be over 25 years of age . Threats Major threats to the binturong are habitat loss and degradation of forests through logging and conversion of forests to non-forest land-uses throughout the binturong 's range . Habitat loss has been severe in the lowlands of the Sundaic part of its range , and there is no evidence that the binturong uses the plantations that are largely replacing natural forest . In China , rampant deforestation and opportunistic logging practices have fragmented suitable habitat or eliminated sites altogether . In the Philippines , it is captured for the wildlife trade , and in the south of its range it is also taken for human consumption . In Laos , it is one of the most frequently displayed caged live carnivores and skins are traded frequently in at least Vientiane . In parts of Laos , it is considered a delicacy and also traded as a food item to Vietnam.The Orang Asli of Malaysia keep binturong as pets . Conservation India included the binturong in CITES Appendix III and in Schedule I of the Wild Life Protection Act 1973 , so that it has the highest level of protection . In China , it is listed as critically endangered . It is completely protected in Bangladesh , and partially in Thailand , Malaysia , and Vietnam . Licensed hunting of binturong is allowed in Indonesia , and it is not protected in Brunei.World Binturong Day , an event dedicated to binturong awareness and conservation , takes place yearly every second Saturday of May . In captivity Binturongs are common in zoos , and captive individuals represent a source of genetic diversity essential for long-term conservation . Their geographic origin is either usually unknown , or they are offspring of several generations of captive-bred animals . References External links '' Bearcat '' . Zooborns . 2008 . Bird , K.
