caterpillar larval stage member order lepidoptera insect order comprising butterfly moth common name application word arbitrary since larva sawfly commonly called caterpillar well lepidopteran symphytan larva eruciform body shape caterpillar specie herbivorous folivorous insectivorous even cannibalistic feed animal product example clothes moth feed wool horn moth feed hoof horn dead ungulate caterpillar typically voracious feeder many among serious agricultural pest fact many moth specie best known caterpillar stage damage cause fruit agricultural produce whereas moth obscure direct harm conversely various specie caterpillar valued source silk human animal food biological control pest plant etymology origin word caterpillar date early century derive middle english catirpel catirpeller probably alteration old north french catepelose cate cat latin cattus pelose hairy latin pilosus inchworm looper caterpillar family geometridae named way move appearing measure earth word geometrid mean greek primary reason unusual locomotion elimination nearly prolegs except clasper terminal segment description caterpillar soft body grow rapidly moult size varies specie instar moult small mm cm larva order hymenoptera ant bee wasp appear like caterpillar lepidoptera larva mainly seen sawfly suborder however larva superficially resemble caterpillar distinguished presence prolegs every abdominal segment absence crochet hook prolegs present lepidopteran caterpillar one pair prominent ocellus head capsule absence suture front headlepidopteran caterpillar differentiated sawfly larva number pair sawfly larva pair caterpillar maximum pair number stemma simple eye sawfly larva two caterpillar usually twelve six side head presence crochet prolegs absent sawfly sawfly larva invariably smooth head capsule cleavage line lepidopterous caterpillar bear inverted v adfrontal suture fossil geometrid moth caterpillar dating back eocene epoch approximately million year ago wa found preserved baltic amber wa described eogeometer vadens previously another fossil dating back approximately million year wa found lebanese amber defense many animal feed caterpillar rich protein result caterpillar evolved various mean defense caterpillar evolved defense physical condition cold hot dry environmental condition arctic specie like gynaephora groenlandica special basking aggregation behaviour apart physiological adaptation remain dormant state appearance appearance caterpillar often repel predator marking certain body part make seem poisonous bigger size thus threatening type caterpillar indeed poisonous distasteful bright coloring aposematic others may mimic dangerous caterpillar animal dangerous many caterpillar cryptically colored resemble plant feed example caterpillar use camouflage defence specie nemoria arizonaria caterpillar hatch spring feed oak catkin appear green hatch summer appear dark colored like oak twig differential development linked tannin content diet caterpillar may even spine growth resemble plant part thorn look like object environment bird droppings geometridae cover plant part bagworms construct live bag covered sand pebble plant material chemical defense aggressive measure taken caterpillar measure include spiny bristle long fine seta detachable tip irritate lodging skin mucous membrane however bird cuckoo swallow even hairiest caterpillar caterpillar acquire toxin host plant render unpalatable predator instance ornate moth caterpillar utilize pyrrolizidine alkaloid obtain food plant deter predator aggressive caterpillar defense bristle associated venom gland bristle called urticating hair venom among potent defensive chemical animal produced south american silk moth genus lonomia venom anticoagulant powerful enough cause human hemorrhage death see lonomiasis chemical investigated potential medical application urticating hair range effect mild irritation dermatitis example moth plant contain toxin protect herbivore caterpillar evolved countermeasure enable eat leaf toxic plant addition unaffected poison caterpillar sequester body making highly toxic predator chemical also carried adult stage toxic specie cinnabar moth tyria jacobaeae monarch danau plexippus caterpillar usually advertise danger color red yellow black often bright stripe see aposematism predator attempt eat caterpillar aggressive defense mechanism learn avoid future attempt caterpillar regurgitate acidic digestive juice attacking enemy many papilionid larva produce bad smell extrudable gland called osmeteria defensive behavior many caterpillar display feeding behavior allow caterpillar remain hidden potential predator many feed protected environment enclosed inside silk gallery rolled leaf mining leaf surface caterpillar like early instar tomato hornworm tobacco hornworm long organ attached end body caterpillar wiggle organ frighten away fly predatory wasp caterpillar evade predator using silk line dropping branch disturbed many specie thrash violently disturbed scare away potential predator one specie amorpha juglandis even make high pitched whistle scare away bird social behavior relationship insect caterpillar obtain protection associating ant lycaenid butterfly particularly well known communicate ant protector vibration well chemical mean typically provide food rewardssome caterpillar gregarious large aggregation believed help reducing level parasitization predation cluster amplify signal aposematic coloration individual may participate group regurgitation display pine processionary thaumetopoea pityocampa caterpillar often link long train move tree ground head lead caterpillar visible head appear hidden forest tent caterpillar cluster period cold weather predator caterpillar suffer predation many animal european pied flycatcher one specie prey upon caterpillar flycatcher typically find caterpillar among oak foliage paper wasp including genus polistes polybia catch caterpillar feed young behavior caterpillar called eating machine eat leaf voraciously specie shed skin four five time body grow eventually enter pupal stage becoming adult caterpillar grow quickly instance tobacco hornworm increase weight le twenty day adaptation enables eat much mechanism specialized midgut quickly transport ion lumen midgut cavity keep potassium level higher midgut cavity hemolymph caterpillar solely herbivorous many restricted feeding one specie plant others polyphagous including clothes moth feed detritus predatory may prey specie caterpillar eg hawaiian eupithecia others feed egg insect aphid scale insect ant larva parasitic cicada leaf hopper epipyropidae hawaiian caterpillar hyposmocoma molluscivora use silk trap capture snailsmany caterpillar nocturnal example cutworm family noctuidae hide base plant day feed night others gypsy moth lymantria dispar larva change activity pattern depending density larval stage diurnal feeding early instar high density economic effect caterpillar cause much damage mainly eating leaf propensity damage enhanced monocultural farming practice especially caterpillar specifically adapted host plant cultivation cotton bollworm cause enormous loss specie eat food crop caterpillar target pest control use pesticide biological control agronomic practice many specie become resistant pesticide bacterial toxin bacillus thuringiensis evolved affect gut lepidoptera used spray bacterial spore toxin extract also incorporating gene produce within host plant approach defeated time evolution resistance mechanism insectsplants evolve mechanism resistance eaten caterpillar including evolution chemical toxin physical barrier hair incorporating host plant resistance hpr plant breeding another approach used reducing impact caterpillar crop plantssome caterpillar used industry silk industry based silkworm caterpillar human health caterpillar hair cause human health problem caterpillar hair sometimes venom specie approximately family moth butterfly worldwide inflict serious human injury ranging urticarial dermatitis atopic asthma osteochondritis consumption coagulopathy kidney failure brain bleeding skin rash common fatality lonomia frequent cause envenomation brazil case reported lethality ranging death caused often intracranial hemorrhagecaterpillar hair ha also known cause sharp barb end caterpillar hair get lodged soft tissue mucous membrane eye enter tissue difficult extract often exacerbating problem migrate across membranethis becomes particular problem indoor setting hair easily enter building ventilation system accumulate indoor environment small size make difficult vented accumulation increase risk human contact indoor environmentscaterpillars food source
