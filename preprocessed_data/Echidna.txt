result injury evolution first divergence oviparous viviparous offspring develop internally mammal believed occurred triassic period however still disagreement estimated time divergence though finding genetics study especially concerning nuclear gene agreement paleontological finding result technique source like mitochondrial dna slight disagreement finding fossilsmolecular clock data suggest echidna split platypus million year ago fossil dating back million year ago therefore represent basal form rather close relative modern platypus would imply echidna evolved ancestor returned living completely land even though put competition marsupial evidence possible ancestor found echidna phenotypic trait well trait include hydrodynamic streamlining dorsally projecting hind limb acting rudder locomotion founded hypertrophied humeral rotation provides efficient swimming stroke consequently oviparous reproduction monotreme may given advantage marsupial view consistent present ecological partitioning two group advantage could well part responsible observed associated adaptive radiation echidna expansion niche space together contradict fairly common assumption halted morphological molecular evolution continues associated monotreme furthermore study mitochondrial dna platypus also found monotreme marsupial likely sister taxon also implies shared derived morphological trait
