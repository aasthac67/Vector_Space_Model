closely related shorebird recent phylogenomic study support grouping pigeon sandgrouse together along mesites forming sister taxon mirandornithesthe columbidae usually divided five subfamily probably inaccurately example american ground quail dove geotrygon usually placed columbinae seem two distinct subfamily order presented follows baptista et al updatesthe arrangement genus naming subfamily case provisional analysis different dna sequence yield result differ often radically placement certain mainly genus ambiguity probably caused long branch attraction seems confirm first pigeon evolved australasian region treronidae allied form crowned pheasant pigeon example represent earliest radiation groupthe family columbidae previously also contained family raphidae consisting extinct
