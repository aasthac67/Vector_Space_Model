baboon primate comprising genus papio one genus old world monkey five specie baboon commonly known hamadryas baboon guinea baboon olive baboon yellow baboon chacma baboon specie native one five area africa hamadryas baboon also native part arabian peninsula baboon among largest primate existed least two million year baboon vary size weight depending specie smallest kinda baboon cm length weighs

ischial callosity provide sitting comfort male hamadryas baboon large white mane baboon exhibit sexual dimorphism size colour canine teeth development baboon diurnality terrestrial sleep tree high cliff rock night away predator found open savannah woodland across africa omnivorous common source food grass seed root leaf bark various fruit insect fish shellfish rodent bird vervet monkey small antelope principal predator nile crocodile leopard lion hyena baboon live hierarchical troop containing harem baboon determine vocal exchange dominance relation individual general male mate female mating order among male depends partly social rank female typically give birth gestation usually one infant female tend primary caretaker young although several female may share duty offspring offspring weaned year reach sexual maturity around five eight year male leave birth group usually reach sexual maturity whereas female stay group life baboon captivity live year wild average year

difficult prey leopard though mostly threat young baboon large male often confront flashing eyelid showing teeth yawning making gesture chasing although prey specie baboon killed black mamba snake usually occurs baboon accidentally rous snake social system collective noun baboon troop baboon live hierarchical troop group size typically around animal vary depending specie location time year structure within troop varies considerably hamadryas baboon remaining specie sometimes collectively referred savanna baboon hamadryas baboon often appear large group composed many smaller harem one male four female female elsewhere troop recruited still young breed baboon specie promiscuous structure strict dominance hierarchy based matriline hamadryas baboon group typically include younger male attempt mate female unless older male removed harem hamadryas baboon male jealously guard female point grabbing biting female wander far away despite male raid harem female situation often cause aggressive fight male visual threat usually accompany aggressive fight include quick flashing eyelid accompanied yawn show teeth male succeed taking female another harem called takeover several specie infant baboon taken male hostage used shield fight baboon determine vocal exchange dominance relation individual confrontation occurs different family baboon take offensive baboon show interest exchange member family baboon take offensive confrontation different family rank challenge wider impact whole troop internal conflict family baboon reinforcing dominancebaboon social dynamic also vary robert sapolsky reported troop known forest troop experienced significantly le aggressive social dynamic aggressive male died tuberculosis outbreak leaving skewed gender ration majority female minority male relatively culture persisted extended new male coming troop though sapolsky observed unique troop wa unrecognizably different utopia wa still dominance hierarchy aggressive intrasexual competition amongst male furthermore new behaviour created amongst baboon rather difference wa frequency context existing baboon behaviour mating baboon mating behavior varies greatly depending social structure troop mixed group savanna baboon male mate female mating order among male depends partially social ranking fight male unusual however subtle possibility mixed group male sometimes try win friendship female garner friendship may help groom female help care young supply food probability high young offspring female clearly prefer friendly male mate however male also take infant fight protect harm female initiate mating presenting swollen rump male face birth rearing young life expectancy female typically give birth gestation usually single infant twin baboon rare often survive young baboon weighs approximately g ha black epidermis born female tend primary caretaker young although several female share duty offspring one year young animal weaned reach sexual maturity five eight year baboon male leave birth group usually reach sexual maturity whereas female philopatric stay group whole life baboon captivity known live year wild life expectancy year relationship human
