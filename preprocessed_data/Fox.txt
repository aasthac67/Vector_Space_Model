world becoming increasingly endangered endemic environment california channel island population island smaller mainland limited resource like space food shelter island population therefore highly susceptible external threat ranging introduced predatory specie human extreme weather california channel island wa found population island fox wa low due outbreak canine distemper virus well predation golden eagle since eagle caused population decline much low number fox population went allee effect low enough density individual fitness decrease conservationist therefore take healthy breeding pair wild population breed captivity enough fox release back wild nonnative grazers also removed native plant would able grow back natural height thereby providing adequate cover protection fox golden eagle darwin fox pseudalopex fulvipes darwin fox considered critically endangered small known population mature individual well restricted distribution chilean mainland population limited nahuelbuta national park surrounding valdivian rainforest similarly chiloe island population limited forest extend southernmost northwestern part island though nahuelbuta national park protected specie live chiloe island major problem specie face therefore dwindling limited habitat due cutting burning unprotected forest deforestation darwin fox habitat shrinking allowing competitor chilla fox preferred habitat open space increase darwin fox subsequently outcompeted another problem face inability fight disease transmitted increasing number pet dog conserve animal researcher suggest need forest link
