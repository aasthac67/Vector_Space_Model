attack insect specie except giant anteater long prehensile tail behaviour anteater mostly solitary mammal prepared defend territory normally enter territory another anteater sex male often enter territory associated female territorial dispute occurs vocalize swat sometimes sit even ride back opponentsanteaters poor sight excellent sense smell specie depend latter foraging feeding defence hearing thought goodwith body temperature fluctuating anteater like xenarthrans among lowest body temperature mammal tolerate greater fluctuation body temperature mammal daily energy intake food slightly greater energy need daily activity anteater probably coordinate body temperature keep cool period rest heat foraging reproduction adult male slightly larger muscular female wider head neck visual sex determination however difficult since penis testis located internally rectum urinary bladder male female single pair mamma near armpit fertilization occurs contact transfer without intromission similar lizard polygynous mating usually result single offspring twin possible rare large foreclaws prevent mother grasping newborn therefore carry offspring feeding anteater specialized
