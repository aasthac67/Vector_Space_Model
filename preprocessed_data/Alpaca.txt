distinction made alpaca several style mohair lusteran adult alpaca generally centimetre inch height shoulder withers usually weigh kilogram pound background relationship alpaca vicuna wa disputed many year century four south american lamoid specie assigned scientific name time alpaca wa assumed descended llama ignoring similarity size fleece dentition alpaca vicuna classification wa complicated fact four specie south american camelid interbreed produce fertile offspring advent dna technology made accurate classification possible alpaca genus classification changed lama pacos vicugna pacos following presentation paper work miranda kadwell et al alpaca dna royal society showing alpaca descended vicuna guanaco origin domestication alpaca domesticated thousand year ago moche people northern peru often used alpaca image art known wild alpaca closest living relative vicuna also native south america wild ancestor alpaca family camelidae first appeared america million year ago eocene period common ancestor protylopus descendant divided camelini lamini tribe taking different migratory pattern asia south america respectively although camelids became extinct north america around million year ago flourished south specie see today wa million year ago pliocene genus hemiauchenia tribe lamini split palaeolama lama latter would split lama vicugna upon migrating south america remains vicuna guanaco found throughout peru around year domesticated counterpart llama alpaca found mummified moquegua valley south peru dating back year mummy found region show two breed alpaca precise analysis bone teeth mummy ha demonstrated alpaca domesticated vicugna vicugna research considering behavioral morphological characteristic alpaca wild counterpart seems indicate alpaca could find origin lama guanicoe well vicugna vicugna even hybrid genetic analysis show different picture origin alpaca analysis mitochondrial dna show alpaca guanaco mtdna many also vicuna mtdna microsatellite data show alpaca dna much similar vicuna dna guanaco dna suggests alpaca descendant vicugna vicugna lama guanicoe discrepancy mtdna seems result fact mtdna transmitted mother recent husbandry practice caused hybridization llama primarily carry guanaco dna alpaca extent many today domestic alpaca result male alpaca bred female llama would explain mtdna consistent guanaco situation ha led attempt reclassify alpaca vicugna pacos breed alpaca come two breed suri huacaya based fiber rather scientific european classification huacaya alpaca commonly found constituting population huacaya alpaca thought originated peru due thicker fleece make suited survive higher altitude andes pushed highland peru arrival spanishsuri alpaca represent smaller portion total alpaca population around thought prevalent peru since could kept lower altitude thicker fleece wa needed harsh weather condition behavior alpaca social herd animal live family group consisting territorial alpha male female young one alpaca warn herd intruder making sharp noisy inhalation sound like bray herd may attack smaller predator front foot spit kick aggression towards member canid family coyote fox dog etc exploited alpaca used guard llama guarding sheepalpacas sometimes aggressive also gentle intelligent extremely observant part alpaca quiet male alpaca energetic get involved fighting alpaca prey cautious also nervous feel type threat feel threatened person another alpaca come behind themalpacas set boundary personal space within family group make hierarchy sense alpaca aware dominant animal group body language key communication help maintain order one example body communication includes pose named broadside ear pulled back stand sideways pose used male alpaca defending territorywhen young tend follow larger object sit near example baby alpaca mother also apply alpaca pass older alpaca training alpaca often trainable usually respond reward commonly form food able petted without getting agitated although usually animal patted around head neck alpaca usually quite easy herd even large group although herded recommended handler approach animal slowly quietly result danger animal

several organization throughout united state participate spitting alpaca spit capable spit somewhat euphemistic occasionally projectile contains air little saliva although alpaca commonly bring acidic stomach content generally green grassy mix project onto chosen target spitting mostly reserved alpaca alpaca also occasionally spit human spitting result called sour mouth sour mouth characterized lower lip gaping mouthalpacas spit several reason female alpaca spit interested male alpaca typically think already impregnated sex alpaca keep others away food anything eye give slight warning spitting blowing air raising head giving ear pinned appearancealpacas spit ten foot need example another animal doe back alpaca throw stomach content resulting lot spitsome sign stress lead spitting habit include humming wrinkle eye drooling rapid breathing stomping foot alpaca show sign interest alertness tend sniff surroundings watch closely stand quietly place starewhen come reproduction spit response triggered progesterone level increased associated ovulation hygiene alpaca use communal dung pile graze behaviour tends limit spread internal parasite generally male much tidier fewer dung pile female tend stand line go one female approach dung pile begin urinate defecate rest herd often follows alpaca waste collected used garden fertilizer even natural fertilizerbecause preference using dung pile alpaca successfully develop dental hygiene problem affect eating behavior warning sign include protracted chewing eating food spilling mouth poor body condition sunken cheek also telltale dental problem sound alpaca make variety sound humming alpaca born mother baby hum constantly also hum sign distress especially separated herd alpaca may also hum curious happy worried cautious snorting alpaca snort another alpaca invading space grumbling alpaca grumble warn example one invading another personal space sound like gurgling clucking similar hen cluck alpaca cluck mother concerned cria male alpaca cluck signal friendly behavior screaming scream extremely deafening loud scream handled correctly attacked potential enemy screeching cry presumably intended terrify opponent sound typically used male alpaca fight dominance female screech growl angry reproduction female induced ovulators act mating presence semen cause ovulate female usually conceive one breeding occasionally trouble conceiving artificial insemination technically difficult expensive common accomplished embryo transfer widespread male usually ready mate first time two three year age advisable allow young female bred mature ha reached mature weight young female conception possibly common cause uterine infection age maturation varies greatly individual usually recommended novice breeder wait female month age older initiating breedingalpacas breed time difficult breed winter breed autumn late spring popular way alpaca mate pen mating pen mating move female desired male pen another way paddock mating one male alpaca let loose paddock several female alpacasthe gestation period average month usually result single offspring cria twin rare occurring per delivery cria generally pound

society industrial revolution diet alpaca chew food end mixed cud saliva swallow alpaca usually eat body weight normal growth mainly need pasture grass hay silage may also need supplemental energy protein food also normally try chew almost anything eg empty bottle alpaca rancher rotate feeding ground grass regrow fecal parasite may die reusing area pasture grass great source protein season change grass loses gain protein example spring pasture grass ha protein summer ha need energy supplement winter produce body heat warmth get fiber hay long stem provides vitamin e green grass contains vitamin e alpaca eat natural unfertilized grass however rancher also supplement grass grass hay provide selenium necessary vitamin rancher feed domestic alpaca daily dose grain provide additional nutrient fully obtained primary diet alpaca may obtain necessary vitamin native grazing range digestion alpaca like camelids stomach combined chewing cud system allows maximum extraction nutrient forage alpaca ruminant modified ruminant many difference anatomy physiology camelid ruminant stomachalpacas chew food figure eight motion swallow food pas one stomach chamber first second chamber called anaerobic fermentation chamber fermentation process begin alpaca absorb nutrient water first part third chamber end third chamber called stomach secretes acid digest food likely place alpaca
