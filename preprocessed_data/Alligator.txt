gland crocodilian modified salivary gland called salt gland tongue organ still excrete salt crocodile gharials alligator caiman lost ability excrete extremely small quantity ability excrete excess salt allows crocodile better tolerate life saline water migrating alligator caiman lost ability largely restricted freshwater habitat although larger alligator sometimes live tidal mangrove rare case
