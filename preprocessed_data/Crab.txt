show marked sexual dimorphism male often larger claw tendency particularly pronounced fiddler crab genus uca ocypodidae fiddler crab male one greatly enlarged claw used communication particularly attracting mate another conspicuous difference form pleon abdomen male crab narrow triangular form female broader rounded abdomen female crab brood fertilised egg pleopod reproduction lifecycle crab attract mate chemical pheromone visual acoustic vibratory mean pheromone used fully aquatic crab terrestrial semiterrestrial crab often use visual signal fiddler crab male waving large claw attract female vast number brachyuran crab internal fertilisation mate many aquatic specie mating take place female ha moulted still soft female store sperm long time using fertilise egg fertilisation ha taken place egg released onto female abdomen tail flap secured sticky material location protected embryonic development female carrying egg called berried since egg resemble round berry development complete female release newly hatched larva water part plankton release often timed tide tiny zoea larva float take advantage water current spine probably reduces rate predation larger animal zoea specie must find food crab provide enough yolk egg larval stage continue live yolk specie ha particular number zoeal stage separated moult change megalopa stage resembles adult crab except abdomen

including raninids libinia emarginata mictyris platycheles crab notably portunidae matutidae also capable swimming portunidae especially last pair walking leg flattened swimming paddlescrabs mostly active animal complex behaviour pattern communicate drumming waving pincer crab tend aggressive towards one another male often fight gain access female rocky seashore nearly cave crevice occupied crab
