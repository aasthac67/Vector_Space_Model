the alpaca vicugna paco is a speci of south american camelid mammal it is similar to and often confus with the llama howev alpaca are often notic smaller than llama the two anim are close relat and can success both speci are believ to have been domest from their wild rel the vicuna and guanaco there are two breed of alpaca the suri alpaca and the huacaya alpaca alpaca are kept in herd that graze on the level height of the and of southern peru western bolivia ecuador and northern chile at an altitud of to metr to feet abov sea level alpaca are consider smaller than llama and unlik llama they were not bred to be work anim but were bred specif for their fiber alpaca fiber is use for make knit and woven item similar to sheep wool these item includ blanket sweater hat glove scarv a wide varieti of textil and poncho in south america and sweater sock coat and bed in other part of the world the fiber come in more than natur color as classifi in peru as classifi in australia and as classifi in the unit state alpaca commun through bodi languag the most common is spit when they are in distress fear or mean to show domin male alpaca are more aggress than femal and tend to establish domin of their herd group in some case alpha male will immobil the head and neck of a weaker or challeng male in order to show their strength and domin in the textil industri alpaca primarili refer to the hair of peruvian alpaca but more broadli it refer to a style of fabric origin made from alpaca hair such as mohair iceland sheep wool or even wool from other breed of sheep in trade distinct are made between alpaca and the sever style of mohair and lusteran adult alpaca gener is between and centimetr and inch in height at the shoulder wither they usual weigh between and kilogram and pound background the relationship between alpaca and vicuna wa disput for mani year in the and centuri the four south american lamoid speci were assign scientif name at that time the alpaca wa assum to be descend from the llama ignor similar in size fleec and dentit between the alpaca and the vicuna classif wa complic by the fact that all four speci of south american camelid can interbre and produc fertil offspr the advent of dna technolog made a more accur classif possibl in the alpaca genu classif chang from lama paco to vicugna paco follow the present of a paper on work by miranda kadwel et al on alpaca dna to the royal societi show the alpaca is descend from the vicuna not the guanaco origin and domest alpaca were domest thousand of year ago the moch peopl of northern peru often use alpaca imag in their art there are no known wild alpaca and it closest live rel the vicuna also nativ to south america is the wild ancestor of the alpaca the famili camelida first appear in america million year ago dure the eocen period from the common ancestor protylopu the descend divid into camelini and lamini tribe take differ migratori pattern to asia and south america respect although the camelid becam extinct in north america around million year ago it flourish in the south with the speci we see today it wa not until million year ago dure the pliocen that the genu hemiauchenia of the tribe lamini split into palaeolama and lama the latter would then split again into lama and vicugna upon migrat down to south america remain of vicuna and guanaco have been found throughout peru for around year their domest counterpart the llama and alpaca have been found mummifi in the moquegua valley in the south of peru date back to year mummi found in thi region show two breed of alpaca more precis analysi of bone and teeth of these mummi ha demonstr that alpaca were domest from the vicugna vicugna other research consid the behavior and morpholog characterist of alpaca and their wild counterpart seem to indic that alpaca could find their origin in lama guanico as well as vicugna vicugna or even a hybrid of both genet analysi show a differ pictur of the origin of the alpaca analysi of mitochondri dna show that most alpaca have guanaco mtdna and mani also have vicuna mtdna but microsatellit data show that alpaca dna is much more similar to vicuna dna than to guanaco dna thi suggest that alpaca are descend of the vicugna vicugna not of the lama guanico the discrep with mtdna seem to be a result of the fact that mtdna is onli transmit by the mother and recent husbandri practic have caus hybrid between llama which primarili carri guanaco dna and alpaca to the extent that mani of today domest alpaca are the result of male alpaca bred to femal llama thi would explain the mtdna consist with guanaco thi situat ha led to attempt to reclassifi the alpaca as vicugna paco breed the alpaca come in two breed suri and huacaya base on their fiber rather than scientif or european classif huacaya alpaca are the most commonli found constitut about of the popul the huacaya alpaca is thought to have origin in peru thi is due to their thicker fleec which make them more suit to surviv in the higher altitud of the and after be push into the highland of peru after the arriv of the spanishsuri alpaca repres a smaller portion of the total alpaca popul around they are thought to have been more preval in peru sinc they could be kept at a lower altitud where a thicker fleec wa not need for harsh weather condit behavior alpaca are social herd anim that live in famili group consist of a territori alpha male femal and their young one alpaca warn the herd about intrud by make sharp noisi inhal that sound like a bray the herd may attack smaller predat with their front feet and can spit and kick their aggress toward member of the canid famili coyot fox dog etc is exploit when alpaca are use as guard llama for guard sheepalpaca can sometim be aggress but they can also be veri gentl intellig and extrem observ for the most part alpaca are veri quiet but male alpaca are more energet when they get involv in fight with other alpaca when they prey they are cautiou but also nervou when they feel ani type of threat they can feel threaten when a person or anoth alpaca come up from behind themalpaca set their own boundari of person space within their famili and group they make a hierarchi in some sens and each alpaca is awar of the domin anim in each group bodi languag is the key to their commun it help to maintain their order one exampl of their bodi commun includ a pose name broadsid where their ear are pull back and they stand sideway thi pose is use when male alpaca are defend their territorywhen they are young they tend to follow larger object and to sit near or under them an exampl of thi is a babi alpaca with it mother thi can also appli when an alpaca pass by an older alpaca train alpaca are often veri trainabl and will usual respond to reward most commonli in the form of food they are abl to be pet without get agit although thi is usual onli when the anim is not be pat around the head or neck alpaca are usual quit easi to herd even in larg group although when be herd it is recommend that the handler approach the anim slowli and quietli not do thi can result in danger for both the anim and the handleralpaca and llama have start show up in us nurs home and hospit as train certifi therapi anim the mayo clinic say therapi can reduc pain depress anxieti and fatigu thi type of anim therapi is grow in popular and there are sever organ throughout the unit state that particip spit not all alpaca spit but all are capabl of do so spit is somewhat euphemist occasion the projectil contain onli air and a littl saliva although alpaca commonli bring up acid stomach content gener a green grassi mix and project it onto their chosen target spit is mostli reserv for other alpaca but an alpaca will also occasion spit at a human spit can

can lead to their spit habit includ hum a wrinkl under their eye drool rapid breath and stomp their feet when alpaca show ani sign of interest or alert they tend to sniff their surround watch close or stand quietli in place and starewhen it come to reproduct they spit becaus it is a respons trigger by the progesteron level be increas which is associ with ovul hygien alpaca use a commun dung pile where they do not graze thi behaviour tend to limit the spread of intern parasit gener male have much tidier and fewer dung pile than femal which tend to stand in a line and all go at onc one femal approach the dung pile and begin to urin defec and the rest of the herd often follow alpaca wast is collect and use as garden fertil or even natur fertilizerbecaus of their prefer for use a dung pile some alpaca have been success develop dental hygien problem which affect their eat and behavior warn sign includ protract chew while eat or food spill out of their mouth poor bodi condit and sunken

declin drastic after the spanish conquistador invad the and mountain in after which of the anim were destroy the spanish also brought with them diseas that were fatal to alpacaseuropean conquest forc the anim to move higher into the mountain which remain there perman although alpaca had almost been wipe out complet they were rediscov sometim dure the centuri by european after find use for them the anim becam import to societi dure the industri revolut diet alpaca chew their food which end up be mix with their cud and saliva and then they swallow it alpaca usual eat of it bodi weight for normal growth they mainli need pastur grass hay or silag but some may also need supplement energi and protein food and they will also normal tri to chew on almost anyth eg empti bottl most alpaca rancher rotat their feed ground so the grass can regrow and fecal parasit may die befor reus the area pastur grass is a great sourc of protein when season chang the grass lose or gain more protein for exampl in the spring the pastur grass ha about protein while in the summer it onli ha they need more energi supplement in the winter to produc bodi heat and warmth they get their fiber from hay or from long stem which provid them with vitamin e green grass contain vitamin a and e alpaca can eat natur unfertil grass howev rancher can also supplement grass with grass hay to provid selenium and other necessari vitamin rancher will feed their domest alpaca a daili dose of grain to provid addit nutrient that are not fulli obtain from their primari diet alpaca may obtain the necessari vitamin in their nativ graze rang digest alpaca like other camelid have a stomach combin with chew cud thi system allow maximum extract of nutrient from forag alpaca are not rumin or modifi rumin as there are mani differ between the anatomi and physiolog of a camelid and a rumin stomachalpaca will chew their food in a figur eight motion swallow the food and then pass it into one of the stomach chamber the first and second chamber call and are anaerob ferment chamber where the ferment process begin the alpaca will further absorb nutrient and water in the first part of the third chamber the end of the third chamber call is where the stomach secret acid to digest food and is the like place where an alpaca will have ulcer if stress poison plant mani plant are poison to the alpaca includ the bracken fern madagascar ragwort oleand and some azalea in common with similar livestock other includ acorn african rue agav amarylli autumn crocu bear grass broom snakewe buckwheat ragwe buttercup calla lili orang tree foliag carnat castor bean and mani other fiber alpaca fleec is a lustrou and silki natur fiber while similar to sheep wool it is warmer not prickli and bear no lanolin which make it hypoallergen without lanolin it doe not repel water it is also soft and luxuri in physic structur alpaca fiber is somewhat akin to hair be veri glossi the prepar card spin weav and finish process of alpaca is veri similar to the process use for wool alpaca fiber is also and meet the us consum product safeti commiss standardsalpaca are typic shear onc per year in the spring each shear produc approxim to kilogram to pound of fiber per alpaca an adult alpaca might produc to kilogram to ounc of fiber as well as to kilogram to ounc of and fiber the qualiti of alpaca fiber is determin by how crimpi it is typic the greater the number of small fold in the fiber the greater the qualiti price alpaca were the subject of a specul bubbl between their introduct to north america in and the earli centuri the price for american alpaca rang from us for a castrat male geld to us for the highest in the world depend on breed histori sex and color in research warn that the higher price sought for alpaca breed stock were larg specul and not support by market fundament given the low inher return per head from the main end product alpaca fiber and price into the per head rather than would be requir for a commerci viabl fiber product herdmarket as the invest you can hug in televis commerci by the alpaca owner and breeder associ the market for alpaca wa almost entir depend on breed and sell anim to new buyer a classic sign of specul bubbl in livestock the bubbl burst in with the price of alpaca breed stock drop by thousand of dollar each year thereaft mani farmer found themselv unabl to sell anim for ani price or even give them awayit is possibl to rais up to alpaca per hectar alpaca per acr as they have a design area for wast product and keep their eat area away from their wast area howev thi ratio differ from countri to countri and is highli depend on the qualiti of pastur avail in mani desert locat it is gener onli possibl to run one to three anim per acr due to lack of suitabl veget fiber qualiti is the primari variant in the price achiev for alpaca wool in australia it is common to classifi the fiber by the thick of the individu hair and by the amount of veget matter contain in the suppli shear livestock alpaca need to eat of bodi weight per day so about two kg lb bale of grass hay per month per anim when formul a proper diet for alpaca water and hay analysi should be perform to determin the proper vitamin and miner supplement program two option are to provid free choic powder or feed a special formul ration indigen to the highest region of the and thi harsh environ ha creat an extrem hardi anim so onli minim hous and predat fenc are need the alpaca stomach allow for extrem effici digest there are no viabl seed in the manur becaus alpaca prefer to onli eat tender plant leav and will not consum thick plant stem therefor alpaca manur doe not need compost to enrich pastur or ornament landscap nail and teeth trim are need everi six to twelv month along with annual shear similar to rumin such as cattl and sheep alpaca have onli lower teeth at the front of their mouth therefor they do not pull the grass up by the root rotat pastur is still
