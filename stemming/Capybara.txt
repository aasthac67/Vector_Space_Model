the capybara hydrochoeru hydrochaeri is a giant cavi rodent nativ to south america it is the largest live rodent in the world also call capivara in brazil chiguir chiguiro in colombia and venezuela carpincho in argentina paraguay and uruguay and ronsoco in peru it is a member of the genu hydrochoeru of which the onli other extant member is the lesser capybara hydrochoeru isthmiu it close rel includ guinea pig and rock cavi and it is more distantli relat to the agouti the chinchilla and the coypu the capybara inhabit savanna and dens forest and live near bodi of water it is a highli social speci and can be found in group as larg as individu but usual live in group of individu the capybara is not a threaten speci but it is hunt for it meat and hide and also for greas from it thick fatti skin etymolog it common name is deriv from tupi a complex agglutin of kaa leaf pii slender u eat ara a suffix for agent noun mean one who eat slender leav or capybara were call sever time cuartin in colombia in in eje cafetero alcala and near barranquilla where the meat wa offer as cuartin asado the scientif name both hydrochoeru and hydrochaeri come from greek udor hydor water and khoiro choiro pig hog classif and phylogeni the capybara and the lesser capybara belong to the subfamili hydrochoerina along with the rock cavi the live capybara and their extinct rel were previous classifi in their own famili hydrochoerida sinc molecular phylogenet studi have recogn a close relationship between hydrochoeru and kerodon the rock cavi support placement of both genera in a subfamili of caviidaepaleontolog classif previous use hydrochoerida for all capybara while use hydrochoerina for the live genu and it closest fossil rel such as neochoeru but more recent have adopt the classif of hydrochoerina within caviida the taxonomi of fossil hydrochoerin is also in a state of flux in recent year the divers of fossil hydrochoerin ha been substanti reduc thi is larg due to the recognit that capybara molar teeth show strong variat in shape over the life of an individu in one instanc materi onc refer to four genera and seven speci on the basi of differ in molar shape is now thought to repres differ age individu of a singl speci cardiatherium paranens among fossil speci the name capybara can refer to the mani speci of hydrochoerina that are more close relat to the modern hydrochoeru than to the cardiomyin rodent like cardiomi the fossil genera cardiatherium phugatherium hydrochoeropsi and neochoeru are all capybara under that concept descript the capybara ha a heavi bodi and short head with fur on the upper part of it bodi that turn underneath it sweat gland can be found in the surfac of the hairi portion of it skin an unusu trait among rodent the anim lack down hair and it guard hair differ littl from over hairadult capybara grow to to cm to ft in length stand to cm to in tall at the wither and typic weigh to kg to lb with an averag in the venezuelan llano of kg lb femal are slightli heavier than male the top record weight are kg lb for a wild femal from brazil and kg lb for a wild male from uruguay also an kg individu wa report in sao paulo in or the dental formula is capybara have slightli web feet and vestigi tail their hind leg are slightli longer than their foreleg they have three toe on their rear feet and four toe on their front feet their muzzl are blunt with nostril and the eye and ear are near the top of their head it karyotyp ha and fn ecolog capybara are semiaquat mammal found throughout almost all countri of south america except chile they live in dens forest area near bodi of water such as lake river swamp pond and marsh as well as flood savannah and along river in the tropic rainforest they are superb swimmer and can hold their breath underwat for up to five minut at a time capybara have flourish in cattl ranch they roam in home rang averag hectar acr in populationsmani escape from captiv can also be found in similar wateri habitat around the world sight are fairli common in florida although a breed popul ha not yet been confirm in one specimen wa spot on the central coast of california diet and predat capybara are herbivor graze mainli on grass and aquat plant as well as fruit and tree bark they are veri select feeder and feed on the leav of one speci and disregard other speci surround it they eat a greater varieti of plant dure the dri season as fewer plant are avail while they eat grass dure the wet season they have to switch to more abund reed dure the dri season plant that capybara eat dure the summer lose their nutrit valu in the winter so are not consum at that time the capybara jaw hing is not perpendicular so they chew food by grind rather than capybara are autocoprophag mean they eat their own fece as a sourc of bacteri gut flora to help digest the cellulos in the grass that form their normal diet and to extract the maximum protein and vitamin from their food they may also regurgit food to mastic again similar to by cattl as is the case with other rodent the front teeth of capybara grow continu to compens for the constant wear from eat grass their cheek teeth also grow continuouslylik it rel the guinea pig the capybara doe not have the capac to synthes vitamin c and capybara not supplement with vitamin c in captiv have been report to develop gum diseas as a sign of scurvythey can have a lifespan of year but live less than four year in the wild becaus they are a favourit food of jaguar puma ocelot eagl and caiman the capybara is also the prefer prey of the anaconda social organ capybara are known to be gregari while they sometim live solitarili they are more commonli found in group of around individu with two to four adult male four to seven adult femal and the remaind juvenil capybara group can consist of as mani as or individu dure the dri season when the anim gather around avail water sourc male establish social bond domin or gener group consensu they can make bark when threaten or when femal are herd youngcapybara have two type of scent gland a morrillo locat on the snout and anal gland both sex have these gland but male have much larger morrillo and use their anal gland more frequent the anal gland of male are also line with detach hair a crystallin form of scent secret is coat on these hair and is releas when in contact with object such as plant these hair have a scent mark and are tast by other capybara capybara by rub their morrillo on object or by walk over scrub and mark it with their anal gland capybara can spread their scent further by urin howev femal usual mark without urin and less frequent than male overal femal mark more often dure the wet season when they are in estru in addit to object male also femal reproduct when in estru the femal scent chang subtli and nearbi male begin pursuit in addit a femal alert male she is in estru by whistl through her nose dure mate the femal ha the advantag and mate choic capybara mate onli in water and if a femal doe not want to mate with a certain male she either submerg or leav the water domin male are highli protect of the femal but they usual can not prevent some of the subordin from copul the larger the group the harder it is for the male to watch all the femal domin male secur significantli more mate than each subordin but subordin male as a class are respons for more mate than each domin male the lifespan of the capybara sperm is longer than that of other rodent capybara gestat is day and produc a litter of four capybara young on averag but may produc between one and eight in a singl litter birth is on land and the femal rejoin the group within a few hour of deliv the newborn capybara which join the group as soon as they are mobil within a week the young can eat grass but continu to ani femal in the wean around week the young form a group within the main group allopar ha been observ in thi speci breed peak between april and may in
