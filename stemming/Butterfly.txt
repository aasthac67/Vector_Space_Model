butterfli are insect in the macrolepidopteran clade rhopalocera from the order lepidoptera which also includ moth adult butterfli have larg often brightli colour wing and conspicu flutter flight the group compris the larg superfamili papilionoidea which contain at least one former group the skipper formerli the superfamili hesperioidea and the most recent analys suggest it also contain the formerli the superfamili hedyloidea butterfli fossil date to the paleocen about million year ago butterfli have the typic insect life cycl wing adult lay egg on the food plant on which their larva known as caterpillar will feed the caterpillar grow sometim veri rapidli and when fulli develop pupat in a chrysali when metamorphosi is complet the pupal skin split the adult insect climb out and after it wing have expand and dri it fli off some butterfli especi in the tropic have sever gener in a year while other have a singl gener and a few in cold locat may take sever year to pass through their entir life cycl butterfli are often polymorph and mani speci make use of camouflag mimicri and aposemat to evad their predat some like the monarch and the paint ladi migrat over long distanc mani butterfli are attack by parasit or parasitoid includ wasp protozoan fli and other invertebr or are prey upon by other organ some speci are pest becaus in their larval stage they can damag domest crop or tree other speci are agent of pollin of some plant larva of a few butterfli eg harvest eat harm insect and a few are predat of ant while other live as mutualist in associ with ant cultur butterfli are a popular motif in the visual and literari art etymolog the oxford english dictionari deriv the word straightforwardli from old english butorfleog similar name in old dutch and old high german show that the name is ancient a possibl sourc of the name is the bright yellow male of the brimston gonepteryx rhamni anoth is that butterfli were on the wing in meadow dure the spring and summer butter season while the grass wa grow taxonomi and phylogeni the earliest lepidoptera fossil are of a small moth archaeolepi mane of jurass age around million year ago mya butterfli evolv from moth so while the butterfli are monophylet form a singl clade the moth are not the oldest butterfli are from the palaeocen moclay or fur format of denmark approxim million year old the oldest american butterfli is the late eocen prodrya persephon from the floriss fossil bed approxim million year oldtradit butterfli have been divid into the superfamili papilionoidea exclud the smaller group of the hesperiida skipper and the more hedylida of america phylogenet analysi suggest that the tradit papilionoidea is paraphylet with respect to the other two group so they should both be includ within papilionoidea to form a singl butterfli group therebi synonym with the clade rhopalocera biolog gener descript butterfli adult are character by their four wing which give the lepidoptera their name ancient greek lepi lepi scale pteron pteron wing these scale give butterfli wing their colour they are pigment with melanin that give them black and brown as well as uric acid deriv and flavon that give them yellow but mani of the blue green red and iridesc colour are creat by structur color produc by the of the scale and hairsa in all insect the bodi is divid into three section the head thorax and abdomen the thorax is compos of three segment each with a pair of leg in most famili of butterfli the antenna are club unlik those of moth which may be threadlik or featheri the long probosci can be coil when not in use for sip nectar from flowersnearli all butterfli are diurnal have rel bright colour and hold their wing vertic abov their bodi when at rest unlik the major of moth which fli by night are often cryptic colour well camouflag and either hold their wing flat touch the surfac on which the moth is stand or fold them close over their bodi some moth such as the hummingbird are except to these rule butterfli larva caterpillar have a hard sclerotis head with strong mandibl use for cut their food most often leav they have cylindr bodi with ten segment to the abdomen gener with short proleg on segment and the three pair of true leg on the thorax have five segment each mani are well camouflag other are aposemat with bright colour and bristli project contain toxic chemic obtain from their food plant the pupa or chrysali unlik that of moth is not wrap in a cocoonmani butterfli are sexual dimorph most butterfli have the zw system where femal are the heterogamet sex zw and male homogamet zz distribut and migrat butterfli are distribut worldwid except antarctica total some speci of these are nearctic neotrop palearct afrotrop and are distribut across the combin orient and region the monarch butterfli is nativ to the america but in the nineteenth centuri or befor spread across the world and is now found in australia new zealand other part of oceania and the iberian peninsula it is not clear how it dispers adult may have been blown by the wind or larva or pupa may have been accident transport by human but the presenc of suitabl host plant in their new environ wa a necess for their success establish mani butterfli such as the paint ladi monarch and sever danain migrat for long distanc these migrat take place over a number of gener and no singl individu complet the whole trip the eastern north american popul of monarch can travel thousand of mile to overwint site in mexico there is a revers migrat in the spring it ha recent been shown that the british paint ladi undertak a round trip in a seri of step by up to six success gener from tropic africa to the arctic circl almost doubl the length of the famou migrat undertaken by monarch spectacular migrat associ with the monsoon are seen in peninsular india migrat have been studi in more recent time use wing tag and also use stabl hydrogen isotopesbutterfli navig use a sun compass they can see polar light and therefor orient even in cloudi condit the polar light near the ultraviolet spectrum appear to be particularli import mani migratori butterfli live in area where breed season are short the life histori of their host plant also influenc butterfli behaviour life cycl butterfli in their adult stage can live from a week to nearli a year depend on the speci mani speci have long larval life stage while other can remain dormant in their pupal or egg stage and therebi surviv winter the melissa arctic oenei melissa overwint twice as a caterpillar butterfli may have one or more brood per year the number of gener per year vari from temper to tropic region with tropic region show a trend toward multivoltin courtship is often aerial and often involv pheromon butterfli then land on the ground or on a perch to mate copul take place and may last from minut to hour simpl photoreceptor cell locat at the genit are import for thi and other adult behaviour the male pass a spermatophor to the femal to reduc sperm competit he may cover her with hi scent or in some speci such as the apollo parnassiu plug her genit open to prevent her from mate againth vast major of butterfli have a life cycl egg larva caterpillar pupa chrysali and imago adult in the genera colia erebia euchlo and parnassiu a small number of speci are known that reproduc when the femal die a partial develop larva emerg from her abdomen egg butterfli egg are protect by a outer layer of shell call the chorion thi is line with a thin coat of wax which prevent the egg from dri out befor the larva ha had time to fulli develop each egg contain a number of tini open at one end call micropyl the purpos of these hole is to allow sperm to enter and fertil the egg butterfli egg vari greatli in size and shape between speci but are usual upright and fine sculptur some speci lay egg singli other in batch mani femal produc between one hundr and two hundr eggsbutterfli egg are fix to a leaf with a special glue which harden rapidli as it harden it contract deform the shape of the egg thi glue is easili seen surround the base of everi egg form a meniscu the natur of the glue ha been littl research but in the case of pieri brassica it begin as a pale yellow granular secret contain acidophil protein thi is viscou and darken when expos to air becom a rubberi materi which soon set solid butterfli in the genu agathymu do not fix their egg to a leaf instead the newli laid egg fall to the base of the plantegg are almost invari laid on plant each speci of butterfli ha it own host plant rang and while some speci of butterfli are restrict to just one speci of plant other use a rang of plant speci often includ member of a common famili in some speci such as the great spangl fritillari the egg are deposit close to but not on the food plant thi most like happen when the egg overwint befor hatch and where the host plant lose it leav in winter as do violet in thi exampleth egg stage last a few week in most butterfli but egg laid close to winter especi in temper region go through a diapaus rest stage and the hatch may take place onli in spring some temper region butterfli such as the camberwel beauti lay their egg in the spring and have them hatch in the summer caterpillar larva butterfli larva or caterpillar consum plant leav and spend practic all of their time search for and eat food although most caterpillar are herbivor a few speci are predat spalgi epiu eat scale insect while lycaenid such as liphyra brassoli are myrmecophil eat ant larva some larva especi those of the lycaenida form mutual associ with ant they commun with the ant use vibrat that are transmit through the substrat as well as use chemic signal the ant provid some degre of protect to these larva and they in turn gather honeydew secret larg blue phengari arion caterpillar trick myrmica ant into take them back to the ant coloni where they feed on the ant egg and larva in a parasit relationship caterpillar matur through a seri of development stage known as instar near the end of each stage the larva undergo a process call apolysi mediat by the releas of a seri of neurohormon dure thi phase the cuticl a tough outer layer made of a mixtur of chitin and special protein is releas from the softer epidermi beneath and the epidermi begin to form a new cuticl at the end of each instar the larva moult the old cuticl split and the new cuticl expand rapidli harden and develop pigment develop of butterfli wing pattern begin by the last larval instar caterpillar have short antenna and sever simpl eye the mouthpart are adapt for chew with power mandibl and a pair of maxilla each with a segment palp adjoin these is the which hous a tubular spinneret which is abl to extrud silk caterpillar such as those in the genu calpod famili hesperiida have a special tracheal system on the segment that function as a primit lung butterfli caterpillar have three pair of true leg on the thorac segment and up to six pair of proleg aris from the abdomin segment these proleg have ring of tini hook call crochet that are engag hydrostat and help the caterpillar grip the substrat the epidermi bear tuft of seta the posit and number of which help in identifi the speci there is also decor in the form of hair protuber protuber and spine intern most of the bodi caviti is taken up by the gut but there may also be larg silk gland and special gland which secret distast or toxic substanc the develop wing are present in later stage instar and the gonad start develop in the egg stage pupa when the larva is fulli grown hormon such as prothoracicotrop hormon ptth are produc at thi point the larva stop feed and begin wander in the quest for a suitabl pupat site often the undersid of a leaf or other conceal locat there it spin a button of silk which it use to fasten it bodi to the surfac and moult for a final time while some caterpillar spin a cocoon to protect the pupa most speci do not the nake pupa often known as a chrysali usual hang head down from the cremast a spini pad at the posterior end but in some speci a silken girdl may be spun to keep the pupa in a posit most of the tissu and cell of the larva are broken down insid the pupa as the constitu materi is rebuilt into the imago the structur of the transform insect is visibl from the exterior with the wing fold flat on the ventral surfac and the two halv of the probosci with the antenna and the leg between themth pupal transform into a butterfli through metamorphosi ha held great appeal to mankind to transform from the miniatur wing visibl on the outsid of the pupa into larg structur usabl for flight the pupal wing undergo rapid mitosi and absorb a great deal of nutrient if one wing is surgic remov earli on the other three will grow to a larger size in the pupa the wing form a structur that becom compress from top to bottom and pleat from proxim to distal end as it grow so that it can rapidli be unfold to it full adult size sever boundari seen in the adult colour pattern are mark by chang in the express of particular transcript factor in the earli pupa adult the reproduct stage of the insect is the wing adult or imago the surfac of both butterfli and moth is cover by scale each of which is an outgrowth from a singl epiderm cell the head is small and domin by the two larg compound eye these are capabl of distinguish flower shape or motion but can not view distant object clearli colour percept is good especi in some speci in the rang the antenna are compos of mani segment and have club tip unlik moth that have taper or featheri antenna the sensori receptor are concentr in the tip and can detect odour tast receptor are locat on the palp and on the feet the mouthpart are adapt to suck and the mandibl are usual reduc in size or absent the first maxilla are elong into a tubular probosci which is curl up at rest and expand when need to feed the first and second maxilla bear palp which function as sensori organ some speci have a reduc probosci or maxillari palp and do not feed as adultsmani heliconiu butterfli also use their probosci to feed on pollen in these speci onli of the amino acid use in reproduct come from larval feed which allow them to develop more quickli as caterpillar and give them a longer lifespan of sever month as adultsth thorax of the butterfli is devot to locomot each of the three thorac segment ha two leg among nymphalid the first pair is reduc and the insect walk on four leg the second and third segment of the thorax bear the wing the lead edg of the forew have thick vein to strengthen them and the hindw are smaller and more round and have fewer stiffen vein the forew and hindw are not hook togeth as they are in moth but are coordin by the friction of their overlap part the front two segment have a pair of spiracl which are use in respirationth abdomen consist of ten segment and contain the gut and genit organ the front eight segment have spiracl and the termin segment is modifi for reproduct the male ha a pair of clasp organ attach to a ring structur and dure copul a tubular structur is extrud and insert into the femal vagina a spermatophor is deposit in the femal follow which the sperm make their way to a semin receptacl where they are store for later use in both sex the genitalia are adorn with variou spine teeth scale and bristl which act to prevent the butterfli from mate with an insect of anoth speci after it emerg from it pupal stage a butterfli can not fli until the wing are unfold a newli emerg butterfli need to spend some time inflat it wing with hemolymph and let them dri dure which time it is extrem vulner to predat behaviour butterfli feed primarili on nectar from flower some also deriv nourish from pollen tree sap rot fruit dung decay flesh and dissolv miner in wet sand or dirt butterfli are import as pollin for some speci of plant in gener they do not carri as much pollen load as bee but they are capabl of move pollen over greater distanc flower constanc ha been observ for at least one speci of butterflyadult butterfli consum onli liquid ingest through the probosci they sip water from damp patch for hydrat and feed on nectar from flower from which they obtain sugar for energi and sodium and other miner vital for reproduct sever speci of butterfli need more sodium than that provid by nectar and are attract by sodium in salt they sometim land on peopl attract by the salt in human sweat some butterfli also visit dung and scaveng rot fruit or carcass to obtain miner and nutrient in mani speci thi behaviour is restrict to the male and studi have suggest that the nutrient collect may be provid as a nuptial gift along with the spermatophor dure matingin hilltop male of some speci seek hilltop and ridg top which they patrol in search for femal sinc it usual occur in speci with low popul densiti it is assum these landscap point are use as meet place to find matesbutterfli use their antenna to sens the air for wind and scent the antenna come in variou shape and colour the hesperiid have a point angl or hook to the antenna while most other famili show knob antenna the antenna are richli cover with sensori organ known as sensilla a butterfli sens of tast is coordin by chemoreceptor on the tarsi or feet which work onli on contact and are use to determin whether an insect offspr will be abl to feed on a leaf befor egg are laid on it mani butterfli use chemic signal pheromon some have special scent scale androconia or other structur coremata or hair pencil in the danaida vision is
