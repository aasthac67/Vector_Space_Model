gull or colloqui seagul are seabird of the famili larida in the subord lari they are most close relat to the tern famili sternida and onli distantli relat to auk skimmer and even more distantli to wader until the centuri most gull were place in the genu laru but that arrang is now consid polyphylet lead to the resurrect of sever genera an older name for gull is mew which is cognat with german mow danish mage swedish ma dutch meeuw and french mouett and can still be found in certain region dialectsgul are typic medium to larg bird usual grey or white often with black mark on the head or wing they typic have harsh wail or squawk call stout longish bill and web feet most gull are carnivor which take live food or scaveng opportunist particularli the laru speci live food often includ

their food gull have been observ prey on live whale land on the whale as it surfac to peck out piec of flesh descript and morpholog gull rang in size from the littl gull at gram ounc and centimetr inch to the great gull at kg lb oz and cm in they are gener uniform in shape with heavi bodi long wing and moder long neck the tail of all but three speci are round the except be sabin gull and gull which have fork tail and ross gull which ha a tail gull have moder long leg especi when compar to the similar tern with fulli web feet the bill is gener heavi and slightli hook with the larger speci have stouter bill than the smaller speci the bill colour is often yellow with a red spot for the larger speci and red dark red or black in the smaller speciesth gull are generalist feeder inde they are the least specialis of all the seabird and their morpholog allow for equal adept in swim fli and walk they are more adept walk on land than most other seabird and the smaller gull tend to be more manoeuvr while walk the walk gait of gull includ a slight side to side motion someth that can be exagger in breed display in the air they are abl to hover and they are also abl to take off quickli with littl spaceth gener pattern of plumag in adult gull is a white bodi with a darker mantl the extent to which the mantl is darker vari from pale grey to black a few speci vari in thi the ivori gull is entir white and some like the lava gull and heermann gull have partli or entir grey bodi the wingtip of most speci are black which improv their resist to wear and tear usual with a diagnost pattern of white mark the head of a gull may be cover by a dark hood or be entir white the plumag of the head vari by breed season in nonbreed gull the hood is lost sometim leav a singl spot behind the eye and in gull nonbreed head may have streak distribut and habitat the gull have a worldwid cosmopolitan distribut they breed on everi contin includ the margin of antarctica and are found in the high arctic as well they are less common on tropic island although a few speci do live on island such as the galapago and new caledonia mani speci breed in coastal coloni with a prefer for island and one speci the grey gull breed in the interior of dri desert far from water consider varieti exist in the famili and speci may breed and feed in marin freshwat or terrestri habitatsmost gull speci are migratori with bird move to warmer habitat dure the winter but the extent to which they migrat vari by speci some migrat long distanc like franklin gull which migrat from canada to winter ground in the south of south america other speci move much shorter distanc and may simpli dispers along the coast near their breed site behaviour diet and feed charadriiform bird drink salt water as well as fresh water as they possess exocrin gland locat in supraorbit groov of the skull by which salt can be excret through the nostril to assist the kidney in maintain electrolyt balanc gull are highli adapt feeder that opportunist take a wide rang of prey the food taken by gull includ fish and marin and freshwat invertebr both aliv and alreadi dead terrestri arthropod and invertebr such as insect and earthworm rodent egg carrion offal reptil amphibian plant item such as seed and fruit human refus chip and even other bird no gull speci is a specialist and no gull speci forag use onli a singl method the type of food depend on circumst and terrestri prey such as seed fruit and earthworm are more common dure the breed season while marin prey is more common in the nonbreed season when bird spend more time on larg bodi of water in addit to take a wide rang of prey gull display great versatil in how they obtain prey prey can be obtain in the air on water or on land in the air a number of hood speci are abl to hawk insect on the wing larger speci perform thi feat more rare gull on the wing also snatch item both off water and off the ground and over water they also to catch prey again smaller speci are more manoeuvr and better abl to fish from the air dip is also common when bird are sit on the water and gull may swim in tight circl or foot paddl to bring marin invertebr up to the surfac food is also obtain by search the ground often on the shore among sand mud or rock larger gull tend to do more feed in thi way in shallow water gull may also engag in foot paddl a method of obtain prey uniqu to gull involv drop heavi shell of clam and mussel onto hard surfac gull may fli some distanc to find a suitabl surfac on which to drop shell and appar a learn compon to the task exist as older bird are more success than younger one while overal feed success is a function of age the divers in both prey and feed method is not the time taken to learn forag skill may explain the delay matur in gullsgul that are known to resid in area where there is a season of plenti mice have over the centuri develop a special method of eat them first the gull captur the mous in a field next the gull fli to a conveni bodi of water the gull then regurgit the mous and dip it in the water biologist who first observ thi habit observ it between mate pair of gull thi initi led them to believ that the femal wa wash off the mous after it had been transport to the breed area but when lone gull both male and femal began to be seen do thi it wa final conclud that the mous be dri the first time it wa swallow could becom lodg in the gull throat a conclus further corrobor when a male gull wa seen to struggl with the eject of the mous the mous be partial eject befor get stuck in the gull throat after to sizabl gulp of water the mous wa suffici moisten to allow the gull to complet eject the mous by wet the mous the gull ensur that the mous doe not becom lodg in it throatgul have onli a limit abil to dive below the water to feed on deeper prey to obtain prey from deeper down mani speci of gull feed in associ with other anim where marin hunter drive prey to the surfac when hunt exampl of such associ includ four speci of gull feed around plume of mud brought to the surfac by feed grey whale and also between orca largest dolphin speci and kelp gull and other seabird breed gull are monogam and coloni breeder that display mate fidel that usual last for the life of the pair divorc of mate pair doe occur but it appar ha a social cost that persist for a number of year after the gull also display high level of site fidel return to the same coloni after breed there onc and even usual breed in the same locat within that coloni coloni can vari from just a few pair to over a hundr thousand pair and may be exclus to that gull speci or share with other seabird speci a few speci nest singli and singl pair of gull may breed in coloni of other bird within coloni gull pair are territori defend an area of vari size around the nest site from other of their speci thi area can be as larg as a radiu around the nest in the her gull to just a tini area of cliff ledg in the kittiwakesmost gull breed onc a year and have predict breed season last for three to five month gull begin to assembl around the coloni for a few week prior to occupi the coloni exist pair their and unpair bird begin court bird then move back into their territori and new male establish new territori and attempt to court femal gull defend their territori from rival of both sex through call and aerial attack nest build is also part of the gull nest are usual mat of herbac matter with a central nest cup nest are usual built on the ground but a few speci build nest on cliff includ the kittiwak which almost alway nest in such habitat and in some case in tree and high place like bonapart gull speci that nest in marsh must construct a nest platform to keep the nest dri particularli in speci that nest in tidal marsh both sex gather nest materi and build the nest but the divis of labour is not alway exactli equal in coastal town mani gull nest on rooftop and can be observ by nearbi human resid clutch size is typic three egg although it is two in some of the smaller speci and onli one egg for the gull within coloni bird synchronis their lay with synchronis be higher in larger coloni although after a certain point thi level off the egg of gull are usual dark tan to brown or dark oliv with dark splotch and scrawl mark and are well camouflag both sex incub the egg with incub bout last between one and four hour dure the day and one parent incub through the night research on variou bird speci includ the gull suggest that femal form pair bond with other femal to obtain alloparent care for their depend offspr a behavior seen in other anim speci like the eleph wolv and the fathead minnowincub last between and day and begin after lay the first egg although it is discontinu until the second egg is laid thi mean the first two chick are born close togeth and the third chick some time later young chick are brood by their parent for about one or two week and often at least one parent remain with them until they fledg to guard them both parent feed the chick although earli on in the rear period the male doe most of the feed and the femal most of the brood and guard taxonomi
