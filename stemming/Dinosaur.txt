modern crocodilian and bird have heart albeit modifi in crocodilian it is like that thi is a trait share by all archosaur includ all dinosaur while all modern bird have high metabol and are endotherm a vigor debat ha been ongo sinc the regard how far back in the dinosaur lineag thi trait extend scientist disagre as to whether dinosaur were endotherm ectotherm or some combin of bothaft dinosaur were discov paleontologist first posit that they were ectotherm thi suppos wa use to impli that the ancient dinosaur were rel slow sluggish organ even though mani modern reptil are fast and despit reli on extern sourc of heat to regul their bodi temperatur the idea of dinosaur as ectotherm remain a preval view until robert t bob bakker an earli propon of dinosaur endothermi publish an influenti paper on the topic in evid indic that some dinosaur thrive in cooler temper climat and that some earli speci must have regul their bodi temperatur by intern biolog mean aid by the anim bulk in larg speci and feather or other bodi cover in smaller speci evid of endothermi in mesozo dinosaur includ the discoveri of polar dinosaur in australia and antarctica as well as analysi of structur within fossil bone that are typic of endotherm scientif debat continu regard the specif way in which dinosaur temperatur regul evolv in saurischian dinosaur higher metabol were support by the evolut of the avian respiratori system character by an extens system of air sac that extend the lung and invad mani of the bone in the skeleton make them hollow earli respiratori system with air sac may have been capabl of sustain higher activ level than those of mammal of similar size and build in addit to provid a veri effici suppli of oxygen the rapid airflow would have been an effect cool mechan which is essenti for anim that are activ but too larg to get rid of all the excess heat through their skinlik other reptil dinosaur are primarili uricotel that is their kidney extract nitrogen wast from their bloodstream and excret it as uric acid instead of urea or ammonia via the uret into the intestin in most live speci uric acid is excret along with fece as a semisolid wast howev at least some modern bird such as hummingbird can be facult ammonotel excret most of the nitrogen wast as ammonia thi materi as well as the output of the intestin emerg from the cloaca in addit mani speci regurgit pellet and fossil pellet that may have come from dinosaur are known from as long ago as the cretac origin of bird the possibl that dinosaur were the ancestor of bird wa first suggest in by thoma henri huxley after the work of gerhard heilmann in the earli centuri the theori of bird as dinosaur descend wa abandon in favor of the idea of their be descend of gener thecodont with the key piec of evid be the suppos lack of clavicl in dinosaur howev as later discoveri show clavicl or a singl fuse wishbon which deriv from separ clavicl were not actual absent they had been found as earli as in oviraptor but misidentifi as an interclavicl in the john ostrom reviv the theori which gain momentum in the come decad with the advent of cladist analysi and a great increas in the discoveri of small theropod and earli bird of particular note have been the fossil of the yixian format where a varieti of theropod and earli bird have been found often with feather of some type bird share over a hundr distinct anatom featur with theropod dinosaur which are now gener accept to have been their closest ancient rel they are most close alli with maniraptoran coelurosaur a minor of scientist most notabl alan feduccia and larri martin have propos other evolutionari path includ revis version of heilmann basal archosaur propos or that maniraptoran theropod are the ancestor of bird but themselv are not dinosaur onli converg with dinosaur feather feather are one of the most recogniz characterist of modern bird and a trait that wa share by all other dinosaur group base on the current distribut of fossil evid it appear that feather were an ancestr dinosaurian trait though one that may have been select lost in some speci direct fossil evid of feather or structur ha been discov in a divers array of speci in mani dinosaur group both among saurischian and ornithischian simpl branch structur are known from heterodontosaurid primit neornithischian and theropod and primit ceratopsian evid for true vane feather similar to the flight feather of modern bird ha been found onli in the theropod subgroup maniraptora which includ oviraptorosaur troodontid dromaeosaurid and bird structur known as pycnofibr have also been found in pterosaur suggest the possibl that filament may have been common in the bird lineag and evolv befor the appear of dinosaur themselv research into the genet of american allig ha also reveal that crocodylian scute do possess dure embryon develop but these keratin are not express by the anim befor hatchingarchaeopteryx wa the first fossil found that reveal a potenti connect between dinosaur and bird it is consid a transit fossil in that it display featur of both group brought to light just two year after charl darwin semin on the origin of speci it discoveri spur the nascent debat between propon of evolutionari biolog and creation thi earli bird is so that without a clear impress of feather in the surround rock at least one specimen wa mistaken for compsognathu sinc the a number of addit feather dinosaur have been found provid even stronger evid of the close relationship between dinosaur and modern bird most of these specimen were unearth in the lagerstatt of the yixian format liaon northeastern china which wa part of an island contin dure the cretac though feather have been found in onli a few locat it is possibl that dinosaur elsewher in the world were also feather the lack of widespread fossil evid for feather dinosaur may be becaus delic featur like skin and feather are not often preserv by fossil and thu are absent from the fossil recordth descript of feather dinosaur ha not been without controversi perhap the most vocal critic have been alan feduccia and theagarten who have propos that some purport fossil are the result of the decomposit of collagen fiber that underlaid the dinosaur skin and that maniraptoran dinosaur with vane feather were not actual dinosaur but converg with dinosaur howev their view have for the most part not been accept by other research to the point that the scientif natur of feduccia propos ha been questionedin it wa report that a dinosaur tail with feather had been found enclos in amber the fossil is about million year old skeleton becaus feather are often associ with bird feather dinosaur are often tout as the miss link between bird and dinosaur howev the multipl skelet featur also share by the two group repres anoth import line of evid for paleontologist area of the skeleton with import similar includ the neck pubi wrist carpal arm and pector girdl furcula wishbon and breast bone comparison of bird and dinosaur skeleton through cladist analysi strengthen the case for the link soft anatomi larg dinosaur had a complex system of air sac similar to those found in modern bird accord to a investig led by patrick m the lung of theropod dinosaur carnivor that walk on two leg and had feet like pump air into hollow sac in their skeleton as is the case in bird what wa onc formal consid uniqu to bird wa present in some form in the ancestor of bird said in scientist describ aerosteon riocoloradensi the skeleton of which suppli the strongest evid to date of a dinosaur with a breath system ct scan of aerosteon fossil bone reveal evid for the exist of air sac within the anim bodi caviti behavior evid fossil of the troodont mei and sinornithoid demonstr that some dinosaur slept with their head tuck under their arm thi behavior which may have help to keep the head warm is also characterist of modern bird sever deinonychosaur and oviraptorosaur specimen have also been found preserv on top of their nest like brood in a manner the ratio between egg volum and bodi mass of adult among these dinosaur suggest that the egg were primarili brood by the male and that the young were highli precoci similar to mani modern birdssom dinosaur are known to have use gizzard stone like modern bird these stone are swallow by anim to aid digest and break down food and hard fiber onc they enter the stomach when found in associ with fossil gizzard stone are call gastrolith extinct of major group the discoveri that bird are a type of dinosaur show that dinosaur in gener are not in fact extinct as is commonli state howev all dinosaur estim to have been speci as well as mani group of bird did suddenli becom extinct approxim million year ago it ha been suggest that becaus small mammal squamata and bird occupi the ecolog nich suit for small bodi size dinosaur never evolv a divers fauna of speci which led to their downfal when terrestri tetrapod were hit by the mass extinct event mani other group of anim also becam extinct at thi time includ ammonit mollusk mosasaur plesiosaur pterosaur and mani group of mammal significantli the insect suffer no discern popul loss which left them avail as food for other survivor thi mass extinct is known as the extinct event the natur of the event that caus thi mass extinct ha been extens studi sinc the at present sever relat theori are support by paleontologist though the consensu is that an impact event wa the primari caus of dinosaur extinct some scientist cite other possibl caus or support the idea that a confluenc of sever factor wa respons for the sudden disappear of dinosaur from the fossil record impact event the asteroid impact hypothesi which wa brought to wide attent in by walter alvarez and colleagu link the extinct event at the end of the cretac to a bolid impact approxim million year ago alvarez et al propos that a sudden increas in iridium level record around the world in the period rock stratum wa direct evid of the impact the bulk of the evid now suggest that a bolid to kilomet to mile wide hit in the vicin of the yucatan peninsula in southeastern mexico creat the approxim km mi chicxulub crater and trigger the mass extinct scientist are not certain whether dinosaur were thrive or declin befor the impact event some scientist propos that the meteorit impact caus a long and unnatur drop in earth atmospher temperatur while other claim that it would have instead creat an unusu heat wave the consensu among scientist who support thi hypothesi is that the impact caus extinct both directli by heat from the meteorit impact and also indirectli via a worldwid cool brought about when matter eject from the impact crater reflect thermal radiat from the sun although the speed of extinct can not be deduc from the fossil record alon variou model suggest that the extinct wa extrem rapid be down to hour rather than year in scientist drill into the seafloor off mexico extract a uniqu geolog record of what they believ to be the day a asteroid smash into the planet deccan trap befor argument that the deccan trap flood basalt caus the extinct were usual link to the view that the extinct wa gradual as the flood basalt event were thought to have start around million year ago and last for over million year howev there is evid that two third of the deccan trap were creat in onli million year about million year ago and so these erupt would have caus a fairli rapid extinct possibl over a period of thousand of year but still longer than would be expect from a singl impact eventth deccan trap in india could have caus extinct through sever mechan includ the releas into the air of dust and sulfur aerosol which might have block sunlight and therebi reduc photosynthesi in plant in addit deccan trap volcan might have result in carbon dioxid emiss which would have increas the greenhous effect when the dust and aerosol clear from the atmospher befor the mass extinct of the dinosaur the
