cockroach or roach are insect of the order blattodea which also includ termit about cockroach speci out of are associ with human habitat about five speci are well known as pest the cockroach are an ancient group date back at least as far as the carbonifer period some million year ago those earli ancestor howev lack the intern ovipositor of modern roach cockroach are somewhat gener insect without special adapt like the suck mouthpart of aphid and other true bug they have chew mouthpart and are like among the most primit of live neopteran insect they are common and hardi insect and can toler a wide rang of environ from arctic cold to tropic heat tropic cockroach are often much bigger than temper speci and contrari to popular belief extinct cockroach rel blattoptera and such as the carbonifer archimylacri and the permian apthoroblattina were not as larg as the biggest modern speci some speci such as the gregari german cockroach have an elabor social structur involv common shelter social depend inform transfer and kin recognit cockroach have appear in human cultur sinc classic antiqu they are popularli depict as dirti pest though the great major of speci are inoffens and live in a wide rang of habitat around the world taxonomi and evolut cockroach are member of the order blattodea which includ the termit a group of insect onc thought to be separ from cockroach current speci and over genera are describ worldwid the name cockroach come from the spanish word for cockroach cucaracha transform by english folk etymolog into cock and roach the scientif name deriv from the latin blatta an insect that shun the light which in classic latin wa appli not onli to cockroach but also to mantidshistor the name blattaria wa use larg interchang with the name blattodea but whilst the former name wa use to refer to cockroach exclus the latter also includ the termit the current catalogu of world cockroach speci use the name blattodea for the group anoth name blattoptera is also sometim use to refer to extinct cockroach rel the earliest fossil blattopteran or roachid are from the carbonifer period million year ago as are fossil roachoid nymphssinc the centuri scientist believ that cockroach were an ancient group of insect that had a devonian origin accord to one hypothesi fossil roachoid that live dure that time differ from modern cockroach in that they had long extern ovipositor and are the ancestor of mantis as well as modern cockroach as the bodi hind wing and mouthpart are not preserv in fossil frequent the relationship of these roachoid and modern cockroach remain disput the first fossil of modern cockroach with intern ovipositor appear in the earli cretac a recent phylogenet analysi suggest that cockroach origin at least in the jurassicth evolutionari relationship of the blattodea cockroach and termit shown in the cladogram are base on eggleton beccaloni and inward the cockroach famili lamproblattida and tryonicida are not shown but are place within the superfamili blattoidea the cockroach famili corydiida and ectobiida were previous known as the polyphagida and blattellida termit were previous regard as a separ order isoptera to cockroach howev recent genet evid strongli suggest that they evolv directli from cockroach and mani author now place them as an epifamili of blattodea thi evid support a hypothesi suggest in that termit are close relat to the cockroach genu cryptocercu thi hypothesi wa origin base on similar of the symbiot gut flagel in termit regard as live fossil and cockroach addit evid emerg when f a mckittrick note similar morpholog characterist between some termit and cockroach nymph the similar among these cockroach and termit have led some scientist to reclassifi termit as a singl famili the termitida within the order blattodea other scientist have taken a more conserv approach propos to retain the termit as the termitoida an epifamili within the order such a measur preserv the classif of
