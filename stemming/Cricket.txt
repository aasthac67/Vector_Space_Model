chang end anoth bowler must temporarili fill in so that the chang is not immediatea bowler reach hi deliveri stride by mean of a and an over is deem to have begun when the bowler start hi for the first deliveri of that over the ball then be in play fast bowler need momentum take a lengthi run up while bowler with a slow deliveri take no more than a coupl of step befor bowl the fastest bowler can deliv the ball at a speed of over kilometr per hour mph and they sometim reli on sheer speed to tri to defeat the batsman who is forc to react veri quickli other fast bowler reli on a mixtur of speed and guil by make the ball seam or swing ie curv in flight thi type of deliveri can deceiv a batsman into miscu hi shot for exampl so that the ball just touch the edg of the bat and can then be caught behind by the or a slip fielder at the other end of the bowl scale is the spin bowler who bowl at a rel slow pace and reli entir on guil to deceiv the batsman a spinner will often buy hi wicket by toss one up in a slower steeper parabol path to lure the batsman into make a poor shot the batsman ha to be veri wari of such deliveri as they are often flight or spun so that the ball will not behav quit as he expect and he could be trap into get himself out in between the pacemen and the spinner are the medium pace seamer who reli on persist accuraci to tri to contain the rate of score and wear down the batsman concentrationther are ten way in which a batsman can be dismiss five rel common and five extrem rare the common form of dismiss are bowl caught leg befor wicket lbw run out and stump rare method are hit wicket hit the ball twice obstruct the field handl the ball and time out the law state that the field team usual the bowler in practic must appeal for a dismiss befor the umpir can give hi decis if the batsman is out the umpir rais a forefing and say out otherwis he will shake hi head and say not out there is effect an eleventh method of dismiss retir out which is not an dismiss as such but rather a retrospect one for which no fielder is credit bat run and extra batsmen take turn to bat via a bat order which is decid beforehand by the team captain and present to the umpir though the order remain flexibl when the captain offici nomin the team substitut batsmen are gener not allow except in the case of concuss substitut in intern cricketin order to begin bat the batsman first adopt a bat stanc standardli thi involv adopt a slight crouch with the feet point across the front of the wicket look in the direct of the bowler and hold the bat so it pass over the feet and so it tip can rest on the ground near to the toe of the back foota skill batsman can use a wide array of shot or stroke in both defens and attack mode the idea is to hit the ball to the best effect with the flat surfac of the bat blade if the ball touch the side of the bat it is call an edg the batsman doe not have to play a shot and can allow the ball to go through to the wicketkeep equal he doe not have to attempt a run when he hit the ball with hi bat batsmen do not alway seek to hit the ball as hard as possibl and a good player can score run just by make a deft stroke with a turn of the wrist or by simpli block the ball but direct it away from fielder so that he ha time to take a run a wide varieti of shot are play the batsman repertoir includ stroke name accord to the style of swing and the direct aim eg cut drive hook pull the batsman on strike ie the striker must prevent the ball hit the wicket and tri to score run by hit the ball with hi bat so that he and hi partner have time to run from one end of the pitch to the other befor the field side can return the ball to regist a run both runner must touch the ground behind the pop creas with either their bat or their bodi the batsmen carri their bat as they run each complet run increment the score of both the team and the striker the decis to attempt a run is ideal made by the batsman who ha the better view of the ball progress and thi is commun by call usual ye no or wait more than one run can be score from a singl hit hit worth one to three run are common but the size of the field is such that it is usual difficult to run four or more to compens for thi hit that reach the boundari of the field are automat award four run if the ball touch the ground en rout to the boundari or six run if the ball clear the boundari without touch the ground within the boundari in these case the batsmen do not need to run hit for five are unusu and gener reli on the help of overthrow by a fielder return the ball if an odd number of run is score by the striker the two batsmen have chang end and the one who wa is now the striker onli the striker can score individu run but all run are ad to the team totaladdit run can be gain by the bat team as extra call sundri in australia due to error made by the field side thi is achiev in four way a penalti of one extra conced by the bowler if he break the rule wide a penalti of one extra conced by the bowler if he bowl so that the ball is out of the batsman reach bye an extra award if the batsman miss the ball and it goe past the and give the batsmen time to run in the convent way leg bye as for a bye except that the ball ha hit the batsman bodi though not hi bat if the bowler ha conced a or a wide hi team incur an addit penalti becaus that ball ie deliveri ha to be bowl again and henc the bat side ha the opportun to score more run from thi extra ball women cricket women cricket wa first record in surrey in intern develop began at the start of the
