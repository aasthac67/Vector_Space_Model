togeth with the sloth they are within the order pilosa the name anteat is also colloqui appli to the unrel aardvark numbat echidna pangolin and some member of the oecobiida extant speci are the giant anteat myrmecophaga tridactyla about m ft in long includ the tail the silki anteat cyclop didactylu about cm in long the southern tamandua or collar anteat tamandua tetradactyla about m ft in long and the northern tamandua tamandua mexicana of similar dimens taxonomi classif the anteat are more close relat to the sloth than they are to ani other group of mammal their next closest relat are armadillo there are four extant speci in three genera giant anteat myrmecophaga tridactyla silki anteat cyclop didactylu northern tamandua mexicana and southern tamandua tamandua tetradactyla there

evolut anteat are one of three surviv famili of a onc divers group of mammal that occupi south america while it wa geograph isol from an invas of anim from north america the other two be the sloth and the armadillo at one time anteat were assum to be relat to aardvark and pangolin becaus of their physic similar to those anim but these similar have sinc been determin to be not a sign of a common ancestor but of converg evolut all have evolv power dig forearm long tongu and toothless snout to subsist by raid termit mound thi similar is the reason aardvark are also commonli call anteat the pangolin ha been call the scali anteat and the word antbear is a common term for both the aardvark and the giant anteat physic characterist all anteat have elong snout equip with a thin tongu that can be extend to a length greater than the length of the head their mouth have lip but no teeth they use their larg curv foreclaw to tear open ant and termit mound and for defens while their dens and long fur protect them from attack from the insect all speci except the giant anteat have a long prehensil tail behaviour anteat are mostli solitari mammal prepar to defend their to to territori they do not normal enter a territori of anoth anteat of the same sex but male often enter the territori of associ femal when a territori disput occur they vocal swat and can sometim sit on or even ride the back of their opponentsanteat have poor sight but an excel sens of smell and most speci depend on the latter for forag feed and defenc their hear is thought to be goodwith a bodi temperatur fluctuat between and and anteat like other xenarthran have among the lowest bodi temperatur of ani mammal and can toler greater fluctuat in bodi temperatur than most mammal it daili energi intak from food is onli slightli greater than it energi need for daili activ and anteat probabl coordin their bodi temperatur so they keep cool dure period of rest and heat up dure forag reproduct adult male are slightli larger and more muscular than femal and have wider head and neck visual sex determin can howev be difficult sinc the peni and test are locat intern between the rectum and urinari bladder in male and femal have a singl pair of mamma near the armpit fertil occur by contact transfer without intromiss similar to some lizard polygyn mate usual result in a singl offspr twin are possibl but rare the larg foreclaw prevent mother from grasp their newborn and they therefor have to carri the offspr until they are feed anteat are special to feed on small insect with each anteat speci have it own insect prefer small speci are special on arbor insect live on small branch while larg speci can penetr the hard cover of the nest of terrestri insect to avoid the jaw sting and other defenc of the invertebr anteat have adopt the feed strategi of lick up larg number of ant and termit as quickli as possibl an anteat normal spend about a minut at a nest befor move on to anoth and a giant anteat ha to visit up to nest per day to consum the thousand of insect it need to satisfi it calor requirementsth anteat tongu is cover with thousand of tini hook call filiform papilla which are use to hold the insect togeth with larg amount of saliva swallow and the movement of the tongu are aid by movement of the jaw the tongu is attach to the sternum and move veri quickli flick time per minut the anteat stomach similar to a bird gizzard ha harden fold and use strong contract to grind the insect a digest process assist by small amount of ingest sand and dirt distribut rang silki anteat and northern tamandua extend their rang as far north as southeastern mexico while giant anteat can be found as far north as central america southern tamandua rang south to uruguay giant anteat did also until their recent extirp there and the rang of all speci except the northern tamandua overlap in eastern brazil anteat were confin to south america which wa formerli an island contin dure most of the cenozo era onc the isthmu of panama form about three million year ago howev anteat expand their rang into central america as part of the great american interchang habitat anteat habitat includ dri tropic forest rainforest grassland and savanna the silki anteat cyclop didactylu is special to an arbor environ but the more opportunist tamandua find their food both on the ground and in tree typic in dri forest near stream and lake the almost entir terrestri giant anteat myrmecophaga tridactyla live in savannasth two anteat of the genu tamandua the southern tamandua tetradactyla and the northern tamandua tamandua mexicana are much smaller than the giant anteat and differ essenti from it in their habit be mainli arbor they inhabit the dens primev forest of south and central america the usual colour is with a broad black later band cover nearli the whole of the side of the bodyth silki anteat cyclop didactylu is a nativ of the hottest part of south and central america and about the size of a cat of
