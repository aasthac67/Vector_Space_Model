ape hominoidea are a branch of old world tailless simian nativ to africa and southeast asia they are the sister group of the old world monkey togeth form the catarrhin clade they are distinguish from other primat by a wider degre of freedom of motion at the shoulder joint as evolv by the influenc of brachiat in tradit and use the term ape exclud human and can includ tailless primat taxonom consid monkey such as the barbari ape and is thu not equival to the scientif taxon hominoidea there are two extant branch of the superfamili hominoidea the gibbon or lesser ape and the hominid or great ape the famili hylobatida the lesser ape includ four genera and a total of sixteen speci of gibbon includ the lar gibbon and the siamang all nativ to asia they are highli arbor and biped on the ground they have lighter bodi and smaller social group than great ape the famili hominida hominid the great ape also includ four genera compris three extant speci of orangutan and their subspeci two extant speci of gorilla and their subspeci two extant speci of chimpanze and their subspeci and one extant speci of human in a singl extant subspeciesexcept for gorilla and human hominoid are agil climber of tree ape eat a varieti of plant and anim food with the major of food be plant food which can includ fruit leav stalk root and seed includ nut and grass seed human diet are sometim substanti differ from that of other ape due in part to the develop of technolog and a wide rang of habit human are by far the most numer of the ape speci in fact outnumb all other primat by a factor of sever thousand to one most hominoid are rare or endang the chief threat to most of the endang speci is loss of tropic rainforest habitat though some popul are further imperil by hunt for bushmeat the great ape of africa are also face threat from the ebola viru current consid to be the greatest threat to surviv of african ape ebola infect is respons for the death of at least one third of all gorilla and chimpanze sinc name and terminolog ape from old english apa is a word of uncertain origin the term ha a histori of rather imprecis of comed or pun usag in the vernacular it earliest mean wa gener of ani anthropoid primat as is still the case for it cognat in other german languag later after the term monkey had been introduc into english ape wa special to refer to a tailless therefor except primat thu the term ape obtain two differ mean as shown in the encyclopaedia britannica entri it could be use as a synonym for monkey and it could denot the tailless humanlik primat in particularsom or recent all hominoid are also call ape but the term is use broadli and ha sever differ sens within both popular and scientif set ape ha been use as a synonym for monkey or for name ani primat with a appear particularli those without a tail biologist have tradit use the term ape to mean a member of the superfamili hominoidea other than human but more recent to mean all member of hominoidea so ape to be confus with great ape becom anoth word for hominoid includ humansth taxonom term hominoid is deriv from and intend as encompass the hominid the famili of great ape both term were introduc by gray the term hominin is also due to gray intend as includ the human lineag see also hominida terminolog human taxonomi the distinct between ape and monkey is complic by the tradit paraphyli of monkey ape emerg as a sister group of old world monkey in the catarhin which are a sister group of new world monkey therefor cladist ape catarrhin and relat contemporari extinct group such as parapithecidaea are monkey as well for ani consist definit of monkey old world monkey may also legitim be taken to be meant to includ all the catarrhin includ ape and extinct speci such as aegyptopithecu in which case the ape cercopithecoidea and aegyptopithecu emerg within the old world monkey the primat call ape today becam known to european after the centuri as zoolog knowledg develop it becam clear that tailless occur in a number of differ and otherwis distantli relat speci sir wilfrid le gro clark wa one of those primatologist who develop the idea that there were trend in primat evolut and that the extant member of the order could be arrang in an ascend seri lead from monkey to ape to human within thi tradit ape came to refer to all member of the superfamili hominoidea except human as such thi use of ape repres a paraphylet group mean that even though all speci of ape were descend from a common ancestor thi group did not includ all the descend speci becaus human were exclud from be among the apestradit the vernacular name ape doe not includ human but phylogenet human homo form part of the famili hominida within hominoidaea thu there are at least three common or tradit use of the term ape may not distinguish between monkey and ape that is they may use the two term interchang or they may use ape for ani tailless monkey or hominoid or they may use the term ape to just mean the hominoid modern taxonomi aim for the use of monophylet group for taxonom classif some literatur may now use the common name ape to mean all member of the superfamili hominoidea includ human for exampl in hi book benton wrote the ape hominoidea today includ the gibbon and the gorilla and chimpanze and human modern biologist and primatologist refer to ape that are not human as ape scientist broadli

ape the largest gibbon the siamang weigh up to kg lb in comparison the smallest great ape the bonobo is to kg to lb the superfamili hominoidea fall within the parvord catarrhini which also includ the old world monkey of africa and eurasia within thi group the two famili hylobatida and hominida can be distinguish from old world monkey by the number of cusp on their molar hominoid have five in the molar pattern wherea old world monkey have onli four in a bilophodont pattern further in comparison with old world monkey hominoid are note for more mobil shoulder joint and arm due to the dorsal

enough evid to provid an outlin of the evolutionari histori of human previous the diverg between human and other live hominoid wa thought to have occur to million year ago and sever speci of that time period such as ramapithecu were onc thought to be hominin and possibl ancestor of human but later fossil find indic that ramapithecu wa more close relat to the orangutan and new biochem evid indic

and ape wa troubl for peopl who deni a close relationship between human and the rest of the anim kingdom linnaeu lutheran archbishop had accus him of impieti in a letter to johann georg gmelin date februari linnaeu wrote it is not pleas to me that i must place human among the primat but man is intim familiar with himself let not quibbl over word it will be the same to me whatev name is appli but i desper seek from you and from the whole world a gener differ between men and simian from the principl of natur histori i certainli know of none if onli someon might tell me one if i call man a simian or vice versa i would bring togeth all the theologian against me perhap i ought to in accord with the law of natur historyaccordingli johann friedrich blumenbach in the first edit of hi manual of natur histori propos that the primat be divid into the quadrumana ie ape and monkey and bimana ie human thi distinct wa taken up by other naturalist most notabl georg cuvier some elev the distinct to the level of order howev the mani affin between human and other primat and especi the great ape made it clear that the distinct made no scientif sens in the descent of man charl darwin wrote the greater number of naturalist who have taken into consider the whole structur of man includ hi mental faculti have follow blumenbach and cuvier and have place man in a separ order under the titl of the bimana and therefor on an equal with the order of the quadrumana carnivora etc recent mani of our best naturalist have recur to the view first propound by linnaeu so remark for hi sagac and have place man in the same order with the quadrumana under the titl of the primat the justic of thi conclus will be admit for in the first place we must bear in mind the compar insignific for classif of the great develop of the brain in man and that the strongli mark differ between the skull of man and the quadrumana late insist upon by bischoff aebi and other appar follow from their differ develop brain in the second place we must rememb that nearli all the other and more import differ between man and the quadrumana are manifestli adapt in their natur and relat chiefli to the erect posit of man such
