grous are a group of bird from the order galliform in the famili phasianida grous are frequent assign to the subfamili tetraonina sometim tetraonida a classif support by mitochondri dna sequenc studi and appli by the american ornithologist union iti and other grous inhabit temper and subarct region of the northern hemispher from pine forest to moorland and mountainsid from rock ptarmigan in northern greenland to attwat prairi chicken in texa descript grous are heavili built like other galliform such as chicken they rang in length from to cm to in and in weight from to kg to lb male are larger than as heavi in the western capercailli the largest member of the famili grous have feather nostril their leg cover in feather down to the toe and in winter the toe too have feather or small scale on the side an adapt for walk on snow and burrow into it for shelter unlik other galliform they have no spur feed and habit these bird feed mainli on catkin leav and typic account for over of adult food by weight thu their diet vari greatli with the season hatchl eat mostli insect and other invertebr gradual reduc their proport of anim food to adult level sever of the speci are notabl for eat larg quantiti of conif needl which most other vertebr refus to digest veget food grous have big crop and gizzard eat grit to break up food and have long intestin with caeca in which symbiot bacteria digest celluloseforest speci flock onli in autumn and winter though individu toler each other when they meet prairi speci are more social and tundra speci ptarmigan lagopu are the most social form flock of up to in winter all grous spend most of their time on the ground though when alarm they may take off in a flurri and go into a long glidemost speci stay within their breed rang all year but make short season movement mani individu of the ptarmigan call rock ptarmigan in the us and willow grous call willow ptarmigan in the us migrat hundr of kilomet reproduct in all but one speci the willow ptarmigan male are polygam mani speci have elabor courtship display on the ground at dawn and dusk which in some are given in lek the display featur male brightli color comb and in some speci brightli color inflat sac on the side of their neck the male display their plumag give vocal that vari wide between speci and may engag in other activ such as drum or flutter their wing rattl their tail and make display flight occasion male fightth nest is a shallow depress or scrape on the in a scanti line of plant materi the femal lay one clutch but may replac it if the egg are lost she begin to lay about a week after mate and lay one egg everi day or two the clutch compris five to egg the egg have the shape of hen egg and are pale yellow spars spot with brown on lay the or last egg the femal start to day of incub chick hatch in dens down and leav the nest immedi they soon develop feather and can fli shortli befor they are two week old the femal and the male in the willow grous stay with them and protect them until their first autumn when they reach their matur weight except in the male capercailli they are sexual matur the follow spring but often do not mate until later year popul grous make up a consider part of the vertebr biomass in the arctic and subarct their number may fall sharpli in year of bad weather or high predat grous popul are a major food sourc for lynx fox marten and bird of prey howev becaus of their larg clutch they can recov quickli the three tundra speci have maintain their former number the prairi and forest speci have declin greatli becaus of habitat loss though popular game bird such as the red grous and the ruf grous have benefit from habitat manag most grous speci are list by the iucn as least concern or near threaten but the greater and lesser prairi chicken are list as vulner and the gunnison grous is list as endang some subspeci such as attwat prairi chicken and the cantabrian capercailli and some nation and region popul are also in danger sexual size dimorph male size select the phenotyp differ between male and femal is call sexual dimorph male grous tend to be larger than femal grous which seem to hold true across all the speci of grous with some differ within each speci in term of how drastic the size differ is the hypothesi with the most support evid for the evolut of sexual dimorph in grous is sexual select sexual select favor larg male stronger select for larger size in male lead to greater size dimorph femal size will increas correspondingli as male size increas and thi is due to hered but not to the extent of the male size thi is becaus femal that are smaller will still be abl to reproduc without a substanti disadvantag but thi is not the case with male the largest among the male grous commonli dub attract the greatest number of femal dure their mate season mate behavior select male grous display lek behavior which is when mani male come togeth in one area and put on display to attract femal femal select choos among the male present for trait they find more appeal male grous exhibit two type typic lek and explod lek in typic lek male display in small area and in explod lek display are done in area that do not have mani resourc for femal male grous can also compet with one anoth for access to femal grous through territori in which a male defend a territori which ha resourc that femal need like food and nest site these differ in male behavior in mate system account for the evolut of bodi size in grous male of territori speci were smaller than those of explod lek speci and male of typic lek speci were the largest overal the male bird that exhibit lek behavior and have to compet with other male for femal to choos them have higher sexual size dimorph thi support the hypothesi of sexual select affect male bodi size and also give an explan for whi some speci of grous have a more drastic differ between male and femal bodi size than other contrast with other bird speci sexual size dimorph can manifest itself differ between grous and other bird in some case the femal is domin over the male in breed behavior which can result in femal that are larger than the male in cultur grous are game and hunter kill million each year for food sport and other use in the unit kingdom thi take the form of driven grous shoot the male black grous tail feather are a tradit
