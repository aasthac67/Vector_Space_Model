there are two speci of passerin bird commonli call chough chuf that constitut the genu pyrrhocorax of the corvida crow famili of bird these are the chough pyrrhocorax pyrrhocorax and the alpin chough or chough pyrrhocorax graculu the chough of australia despit it name is not a true chough but rather a member of the famili corcoracida and onli distantli relat the chough have black plumag and brightli colour leg feet and bill and are resid in the mountain of southern eurasia and north africa they have long broad wing and perform spectacular aerobat both speci pair for life and display fidel to their breed site which are usual cave or crevic in a cliff face they build a line stick nest and lay three to five egg they feed usual in flock on short graze grassland take mainli invertebr prey supplement by veget materi or food from human habit especi in winter chang in agricultur practic which have led to local popul declin and rang fragment are the main threat to thi genu although neither speci is threaten global taxonomi the first member of the genu to be describ wa the chough name as upupa pyrrhocorax by linnaeu in hi systema natura in hi genu upupa contain speci that had a long curv bill and a short blunt tongu these includ the northern bald ibi and the hoopo bird now known to be complet unrel to the choughsth alpin chough wa describ as corvu graculu by linnaeu in the edit of the systema natura although corvu is the crow genu to which the chough rel belong they were consid suffici distinct to be move to the new genu pyrrhocorax by english ornithologist marmaduk tunstal in hi ornithologia britannica the genu name is deriv from ancient greek purrho purro and korax korax raven crow chough wa origin an altern onomatopo name for the jackdaw corvu monedula base on it call the similar chough formerli particularli common in cornwal becam known initi as cornish chough and then just chough the name transfer from one speci to the otherth fossil record from the pleistocen of europ includ a form similar to the alpin chough and sometim categoris as an extinct subspeci of that bird and a prehistor form of the chough p p primigeniu there are eight gener recognis extant subspeci of chough and two of alpin although all differ onli slightli from the nomin form the greater subspeci divers in the speci aris from an earli diverg of the asian and geograph isol ethiopian race from the western formsth closest rel of the chough as indic by a studi of molecular phylogeni is the treepi temnuru temnuru and they form a clade that is sister to the remain live member of the corvida the genu pyrrhocorax speci differ from corvu in that they have brightli colour bill and feet smooth not scale tarsi and veri short dens nasal feather chough have uniformli black plumag lack ani paler area as seen in some of their rel the two pyrrhocorax are the main host of two specialist chough flea frontopsylla frontali and f laetu not normal found on other corvidsth australian chough corcorax melanorhampho despit it similar shape and habit is onli distantli relat to the true chough and is an exampl of converg evolut distribut and habitat chough breed in mountain from morocco and spain eastward through southern europ and the alp across central asia and the himalaya to western china the alpin chough is also found in corsica and crete and the chough ha popul in ireland the uk the isl of man and two area of the ethiopian highland both speci are resid throughout their rang onli occasion wander to neighbour countriesthes bird are mountain specialist although chough also use coastal sea cliff in ireland great britain and brittani feed on adjac short graze grassland or machair the small popul on la palma one of the canari island is also coastal the chough more typic breed in mountain abov m ft in europ m ft in north africa and m ft in the himalaya in that mountain rang it reach metr ft in the summer and ha been record at metr ft altitud on mount everest the alpin chough breed abov m ft in europ m ft in morocco and m ft in the himalaya it ha nest at m ft higher than ani other bird speci and it ha been observ follow mountain ascend mount everest at an altitud of m ft where the two speci occur in the same mountain the alpin speci tend to breed at a higher elev than it rel sinc it is better adapt for a diet at high altitud descript the chough are corvid the chough is centimetr in in length with a centimetr in wingspan and the alpin chough averag slightli smaller at in length with a cm in wingspan these bird have black plumag similar to that of mani corvu crow but they are readili distinguish from member of that genu by their brightli colour bill and leg the alpin chough ha a yellow bill and the chough ha a long curv red bill both speci have red leg as adult the sex are similar but the juvenil of each speci ha a duller bill and leg than the adult and it plumag lack the glossi seen in older bird other physic distinct are summaris in the tabl below the two chough are distinguish from each other by their bill colour and in flight the long broad wing and short tail of the give it a silhouett quit differ from it slightli smaller rel both speci fli with loos deep wing beat and frequent use their manoeuvr to perform acrobat display soar in the updraught at cliff face then dive and roll with fan tail and fold wingsth chough loud ring call is similar in charact to that of other corvid particularli the jackdaw although it is clearer and louder than the call of that speci in contrast the alpin chough ha rippl preep and whistl sweeeooo call quit unlik the crow small subspeci of both chough have higher frequenc call than larger race as predict by the invers relationship between bodi size and frequenc behaviour and ecolog breed chough are monogam and show high partner and site fidel both speci build a bulki nest of root stick and plant stem line with grass fine twiglet or hair it is construct on a ledg in a cave or similar fissur in a cliff face or in locat like abandon build quarri or dam will also sometim use occupi build such as mongolian monasteri the chough are not coloni although in suitabl habitat sever pair may nest in close proximityboth speci lay normal whitish egg blotch with brown or grey which are incub by the femal alon the chick hatch after two to three week chough chick are almost nake but the chick of the higher altitud alpin chough hatch with a dens cover of natal down the chick are fed by both parent and fledg in day after hatch for alpin chough and day for alpin chough lay it egg about one month later than it rel although breed success and reproduct behaviour are similar the similar between the two speci presum aros becaus of the same strong environment constraint on breed behaviour the surviv rate of the juvenil chough is percent and for the alpin it is the annual adult surviv rate is for alpin but is unknown for feed in the summer both chough feed mainli on invertebr such as beetl snail grasshopp caterpillar and fli larva ant are a favour food of the chough prey item are taken from short graze pastur or in the case of coastal popul of chough area where plant growth is hinder by exposur to coastal salt spray or poor soil the chough bill may be use to pick insect off the surfac or to dig for grub and other invertebr the chough typic excav to cm in in the thin soil of it feed area but it may dig to cm in in suitabl conditionspl matter is also eaten and chough will take fallen grain where the opportun aris it ha been report as damag barley crop by break off the ripen head to extract the corn alpin chough reli more on fruit and berri at time of year when anim prey is limit and will readili supplement their winter diet with food provid by tourist activ in mountain region includ ski resort refus dump and picnic area both pyrrhocorax speci feed in flock on open area often some distanc from the breed cliff particularli in winter feed trip may cover km mi distanc and m ft in altitud in the alp the develop of ski abov m ft ha enabl more alpin chough to remain at high level in winterwher their rang overlap the two chough speci may feed togeth in the summer although there is onli limit competit for food an italian studi show that the veget part of the winter diet for the chough wa almost exclus gagea bulb whilst the alpin chough took berri and hip in june chough fed mainli on caterpillar wherea alpin chough ate cranefli pupa later in the summer the alpin chough consum larg number of grasshopp while the chough ad cranefli pupa fli larva and beetl to it diet in the eastern himalaya in novemb alpin chough occur mainli in junip forest where they feed on junip berri differ ecolog from the chough in the same region and at the same time of year which dig for food in the soil of the villag terrac pastur natur threat predat of the chough includ the peregrin falcon golden eagl and eurasian while the common raven will take nestl in northern spain chough preferenti nest near lesser kestrel coloni the falcon which eat onli insect provid a degre of protect against larger predat and the chough benefit in term of a higher breed success the chough is occasion parasitis by the great spot cuckoo a brood parasit for which the eurasian magpi is the primari hostth chough host bird flea includ two frontopsylla speci which are pyrrhocorax specialist other parasit record on chough includ a cestod choanotaenia pirinica and variou speci of chew lice in the genera brueelia menacanthu and philopteru blood parasit such as plasmodium have been found in chough but thi is uncommon and appar doe littl harm parasit level are much lower than in some other passerin group statu both pyrrhocorax speci have extens geograph rang and larg popul neither is thought to approach the threshold for the global popul declin criteria of the iucn red list ie declin more than in ten year or three gener and they are therefor evalu as be of least concern howev some popul particularli on island such as corsica and la palma are small and isolatedboth chough occupi more extens rang in the past reach to more southerli and lower altitud area than at present with the alpin chough breed in europ as far south as southern itali and both the declin and rang fragment continu chough have lost ground in most of europ and alpin chough have lost mani breed site in the east of the contin in the canari island the chough is now extinct on two of the island on which it formerli bred and the alpin wa lost from the archipelago altogetherth caus of the declin includ the fragment and loss of open grassland to scrub or human activ such as the construct of ski resort and a threat come from global warm which would caus the speci prefer alpin climat zone to
