echidna sometim known as spini anteat belong to the famili tachyglossida in the monotrem order of mammal the four extant speci of echidna and the platypu are the onli live mammal that lay egg and the onli surviv member of the order monotremata the diet of some speci consist of ant and termit but they are not close relat to the true anteat of the america which are xenarthran along with sloth and armadillo echidna live in australia and new guinea echidna evolv between and million year ago descend from a monotrem thi ancestor wa aquat but echidna adapt to life on land etymolog the echidna are name after echidna a creatur from greek mytholog who wa as the anim wa perceiv to have qualiti of both mammal and reptil descript echidna are solitari mammal cover with coars hair and spine superfici they resembl the anteat of south america and other spini mammal such as hedgehog and porcupin they are usual black or brown in colour there have been sever report of albino echidna their eye pink and their spine white they have elong and slender snout that function as both mouth and nose like the platypu they are equip with electrosensor but while the platypu ha electroreceptor on it bill the echidna ha onli electroreceptor and the echidna which live in a drier environ ha no more than locat at the tip of it snout they have veri short strong limb with larg claw and are power digger their claw on their hind limb are elong and curv backward to help aid in dig echidna have tini mouth and toothless jaw the echidna feed by tear open soft log anthil and the like and use it long sticki tongu which protrud from it snout to collect prey the ear are slit on the side of their head that are usual unseen as they are blanket by their spine the extern ear is creat by a larg cartilagin funnel deep in the muscl at the echidna also possess the second lowest activ bodi temperatur of all mammal behind the platypu diet the echidna diet consist larg of ant and termit while the zaglossu speci typic eat worm and insect larva the tongu of echidna have sharp tini spine that help them captur their prey they have no teeth and break down their food by grind it between the bottom of their mouth and their tongu echidna faec are cm in long and are cylindr in shape they are usual broken and unround and compos larg of dirt and materi habitat echidna do not toler extrem temperatur they use cave and rock crevic to shelter from harsh weather condit echidna are found in forest and woodland hide under veget root or pile of debri they sometim use the burrow of anim such as rabbit and wombat individu echidna have larg mutual overlap territoriesdespit their appear echidna are capabl swimmer when swim they expos their snout and some of their spine and are known to journey to water in order to groom and bath themselv anatomi echidna and the platypu are the onli mammal known as monotrem the averag lifespan of an echidna in the wild is estim around year when fulli grown a femal can weigh up to kilogram lb and a male can weigh up to kilogram lb the echidna sex can be infer from their size as male are larger than femal on averag the reproduct organ also differ but both sex have a singl open call a cloaca which they use to urin releas their faec and to matemal echidna have spur on the hind feetth neocortex make up half of the echidna brain compar to of a human brain due to their low metabol and accompani stress resist echidna are for their size the longest record lifespan for a captiv echidna is year with anecdot account of wild individu reach year contrari to previou research the echidna doe enter rem sleep but onli when the ambient temperatur is around at temperatur of and rem sleep is suppress reproduct the femal lay a singl leatheri egg day after mate and deposit it directli into her pouch an egg weigh to gram to oz and is about centimetr in long while hatch the babi echidna open the leather shell with a egg tooth hatch take place after day of gestat the young echidna call a puggl born larval and then suck milk from the pore of the two milk patch monotrem have no nippl and remain in the pouch for to day at which time it start to develop spine the mother dig a nurseri burrow and deposit the young return everi five day to suckl it until it is wean at seven month puggl will stay within their mother den for up to a year befor leavingmal echidna have a peni dure mate the head on one side shut down and do not grow in size the other two are use to releas semen into the femal reproduct tract each time it copul it altern head in set of two when not in use the peni is retract insid a preputi sac in the cloaca the male echidna peni is centimetr in long when erect and it shaft is cover with penil spine these may be use to induc ovul in the femaleit is a challeng to studi the echidna in it natur habitat and they show no interest in mate while in captiv prior to no one had ever seen an echidna ejacul there have been previou attempt tri to forc the echidna to ejacul through the use of electr stimul ejacul in order to obtain semen sampl but ha onli result in the peni swellingbreed season begin in late june and extend through septemb male will form line up to ten individu long the youngest echidna trail last that follow the femal and attempt to mate dure a mate season an echidna may switch between line thi is known as the train system threat echidna are veri timid anim when they feel endang they attempt to buri themselv or if expos they will curl into a ball similar to that of a hedgehog both method use their spine to shield them strong front arm allow echidna to continu to dig themselv in whilst hold fast against a predat attempt to remov them from the hole although they have a way to protect themselv the echidna still face mani danger some predat includ feral cat fox domest dog and goanna snake pose a larg threat to the echidna speci becaus they slither into their burrow and prey on the young spineless puggl some precaut that can be taken includ keep the environ clean by pick up litter and caus less pollut plant veget for echidna to use as shelter supervis pet report hurt echidna or just leav them undisturb mere grab them may caus stress and pick them up improperli may even result in injuri evolut the first diverg between ovipar and vivipar offspr develop intern mammal is believ to have occur dure the triassic period howev there is still some disagr on thi estim time of diverg though most find from genet studi especi those concern nuclear gene are in agreement with the paleontolog find some result from other techniqu and sourc like mitochondri dna are in slight disagr with find from fossilsmolecular clock data suggest echidna split from platypus between and million year ago and that fossil date back to over million year ago therefor repres basal form rather than close rel of the modern platypu thi would impli that echidna evolv from ancestor that return to live complet on the land even though thi put them in competit with marsupi further evid of possibl ancestor can be found in some of the echidna phenotyp trait as well these trait includ hydrodynam streamlin dorsal project hind limb act as rudder and locomot found on hypertrophi humer rotat which provid a veri effici swim stroke consequ ovipar reproduct in monotrem may have given them an advantag over marsupi a view consist with present ecolog partit between the two group thi advantag could as well be in part respons for the observ associ adapt radiat of echidna and expans of the nich space which togeth contradict the fairli common assumpt of halt morpholog and molecular evolut that continu to be associ with monotrem furthermor studi of mitochondri dna in platypus have also found that monotrem and marsupi are most like sister taxa it also impli that ani share deriv morpholog trait between marsupi and placent mammal either occur independ from one anoth or were lost in the lineag to monotrem taxonomi echidna are classifi into three genera the genu zaglossu includ three extant speci and two speci known onli from fossil while onli one extant speci from the genu tachyglossu is known the third genu megalibgwilia is known onli from fossil zaglossu the three live zaglossu speci are endem to new guinea they are rare and are hunt for food they forag in leaf litter on the forest floor eat earthworm and insect the

in almost all australian environ from the australian alp to the deep desert of the outback essenti anywher ant and termit are avail it is smaller than the zaglossu speci and it ha longer hair despit the similar dietari habit and method of consumpt to those of an anteat there is no evid support the idea that monotrem have been myrmecophag ant or sinc the cretac the fossil evid of bandicoot and
