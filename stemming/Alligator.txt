an allig is a crocodilian in the genu allig of the famili alligatorida the two live speci are the american allig a mississippiensi and the chines allig a sinensi addit sever extinct speci of allig are known from fossil remain allig first appear dure the oligocen epoch about million year agoth name allig is probabl an anglic form of el lagarto the spanish term for the lizard which earli spanish explor and settler in florida call the allig later english spell of the name includ allagarta and alagarto descript an averag adult american allig weight and length is kg lb and m ft but they sometim grow to m ft long and weigh over kg lb the largest ever record found in louisiana measur m ft the chines allig is smaller rare exceed m ft in length addit it weigh consider less with male rare over kg lb adult allig are black or dark with white undersid while juvenil have strongli contrast white or yellow mark which fade with ageno averag lifespan for an allig ha been measur one of the oldest

louisiana with over a million allig in each state southern florida is the onli place where both allig and crocodil live side by sideamerican allig live in freshwat environ such as pond marsh wetland river lake and swamp as well as in brackish water when they construct allig hole in the wetland they increas plant divers and provid habitat for other anim dure drought they are therefor consid an

male and femal defend prime territori smaller allig have a higher toler for other allig within a similar size class allig move on land by two form of locomot refer to as sprawl and high walk the sprawl is a forward movement with the belli make contact with the ground and is use to transit to high walk or to slither over wet substrat into water the high walk is an up on four limb forward motion use for overland travel with the belli well up from the ground allig have also been observ to rise up and balanc on their hind leg and forward as part of a forward or upward lung howev they can not walk on their hind leg for long distancesalthough the allig ha a heavi bodi and a slow metabol it is capabl of short burst of speed especi in veri short lung allig main prey are smaller anim they can kill and eat with a singl bite they may kill larger prey by grab it and drag it into the water to drown allig consum food that can not be eaten in one bite by allow it to rot or by bite and then spin or convuls wildli until chunk are torn off thi is refer to as a death roll critic to the allig abil to initi a death roll the tail must flex to a signific angl rel to it bodi an allig with an immobil tail can not perform a death rollmost of the muscl in an allig jaw evolv to bite and grip prey the muscl that close the jaw are except power but the muscl for open their jaw are compar weak as a result an adult human can hold an allig jaw shut it is common today to use sever wrap of duct tape to prevent an adult allig from open it jaw when be handl or transportedallig are gener timid toward human and tend to walk or swim away if one approach thi ha led some peopl to the practic of approach allig and their nest in a manner that may provok the anim into attack in florida feed wild allig at ani time is illeg if fed the allig will eventu lose their fear of human and will learn to associ human with food therebi becom both a greater danger to peopl and at greater risk from them diet the type of food eaten by allig depend upon their age and size when young allig eat fish insect snail crustacean and worm as they matur progress larger prey is taken includ larger fish such as gar turtl and variou mammal particularli coypu and muskrat as well as bird deer and other reptil their stomach also often contain gizzard stone they will even consum carrion if they are suffici hungri in some case larger allig are known to ambush dog florida panther and black bear make them the apex predat throughout their distribut in thi role as a top predat it may determin the abund of prey speci includ

differ among them see crocodilia allig much like bird have been shown to exhibit unidirect movement of air through their lung most other amniot are believ to exhibit bidirect or tidal breath for a tidal breath anim such as a mammal air flow into and out of the lung through branch bronchi which termin in small chamber call alveoli as the alveoli repres to flow the inspir air must move back out the same way it came in in contrast air in allig lung make a circuit move in onli one direct through the parabronchi the air first enter the outer branch move through the parabronchi and exit the lung through the inner branch oxygen exchang take place in extens vasculatur around the parabronchilik other crocodilian allig have an armor of boni scute the dermal bone are highli vascularis and aid in calcium balanc both to neutral acid while the anim can not breath underwat and to provid calcium for eggshel formationallig have muscular flat tail that propel them while swim the two kind of white allig are albino and leucist these allig are practic imposs to find in the wild they could surviv onli in captiv and are few in number the aquarium of the america in new orlean ha leucist allig found

consum by human in the archbishop of new orlean rule that for purpos of cathol church disciplin in relat to abstent from meat the flesh of the allig is characteris as fish differ from crocodil while there are rule of thumb for distinguish allig from crocodil all of them admit except such gener rule includ expos vs interdigit teeth the easiest way to distinguish crocodil from allig is by look at their jaw line the teeth on the lower jaw of an allig fit into socket in the upper jaw leav onli the upper teeth visibl when the mouth is close the teeth on the lower jaw of a crocodil fit into groov on the outsid of the top jaw make both the upper and lower teeth visibl when the mouth is close thu creat a toothi grin shape of the nose and jaw allig have wider snout while crocodil snout are typic more point or the allig broader snout have been thought to allow their jaw to withstand the stress of crack open the shell of turtl and other anim that are widespread in their environ howev a studi found veri littl correl between bite forc and snout shape amongst test crocodilian speciesfunct salt gland crocodilian have modifi salivari gland call salt gland on their tongu but while these organ still excret salt in crocodil and gharial those in most allig and caiman have lost thi abil or excret it in onli extrem small quantiti the abil to excret excess salt allow crocodil to better toler life in salin water and migrat through it becaus allig and caiman have lost thi abil they are larg restrict to freshwat habitat although larger allig do sometim live in tidal mangrov and in veri rare case in coastal areasintegumentari sens organ both crocodil and allig have small sensori organ call integumentari sens organ iso or dermal pressur receptor dpr surround their upper and lower jaw these organ allow crocodilian to detect minor pressur chang in surround water and assist them in locat and captur prey in crocodil howev such organ extend over nearli the entir bodi crocodil iso may also
