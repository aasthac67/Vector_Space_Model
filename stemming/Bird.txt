side are separ by atrioventricular valv which prevent back flow from one chamber to the next dure contract be myogen the heart pace is maintain by pacemak cell found in the sinoatri node locat on the right atrium the sinoatri node use calcium to caus a depolaris signal transduct pathway from the atrium through right and left atrioventricular bundl which commun contract to the ventricl the avian heart also consist of muscular arch that are made up of thick bundl of muscular layer much like a mammalian heart the avian heart is compos of endocardi myocardi and epicardi layer the atrium wall tend to be thinner than the ventricl wall due to the intens ventricular contract use to pump oxygen blood throughout the bodi avian heart are gener larger than mammalian heart when compar to bodi mass thi adapt allow more blood to be pump to meet the high metabol need associ with flight organis bird have a veri effici system for diffus oxygen into the blood bird have a ten time greater surfac area
