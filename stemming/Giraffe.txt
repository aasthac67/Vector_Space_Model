the giraff giraffa is an african artiodactyl mammal the tallest live terrestri anim and the largest rumin it is tradit consid to be one speci giraffa camelopardali with nine subspeci howev the exist of up to eight extant giraff speci ha been describ base upon research into the mitochondri and nuclear dna as well as morpholog measur of giraffa seven other speci are extinct prehistor speci known from fossil the giraff chief distinguish characterist are it extrem long neck and leg it ossicon and it distinct coat pattern it is classifi under the famili giraffida along with it closest extant rel the okapi it scatter rang extend from chad in the north to south africa in the south and from niger in the west to somalia in the east giraff usual inhabit savannah and woodland their food sourc is leav fruit and flower of woodi plant primarili acacia speci which they brows at height most other herbivor can not reach giraff may be prey on by lion leopard spot hyena and african wild dog giraff live in herd of relat femal and their offspr or bachelor herd of unrel adult male but are gregari and may gather in larg aggreg male establish social hierarchi through neck which are combat bout where the neck is use as a weapon domin male gain mate access to femal which bear the sole respons for rais the young the giraff ha intrigu variou cultur both ancient and modern for it peculiar appear and ha often been featur in paint book and cartoon it is classifi by the intern union for conserv of natur as vulner to extinct and ha been extirp from mani part of it former rang giraff are still found in numer nation park and game reserv but estim as of indic that there are approxim member of giraffa in the wild more than were kept in zoo in etymolog the name giraff ha it earliest known origin in the arab word zarafah zrf@ perhap borrow from the anim somali name geri the arab name is translat as there were sever middl english spell such as jarraf ziraph and gerfauntz the italian form giraffa aros in the the modern english form develop around from the french giraf camelopard is an archaic english name for the giraff deriv from the ancient greek for camel and leopard refer to it shape and it colour taxonomi live giraff were origin classifi as one speci by carl linnaeu in he gave it the binomi name cervu camelopardali morten thrane brunnich classifi the genu giraffa in the speci name camelopardali is from latin evolut the giraff is one of onli two live genera of the famili giraffida in the order artiodactyla the other be the okapi the famili wa onc much more extens with over fossil genera describ their closest known rel may have been the extinct climacocerid they togeth with the famili antilocaprida whose onli extant speci is the pronghorn have been place in the

bohlinia close resembl modern giraff have a long neck and leg and similar ossicon and dentitionbohlinia enter china and northern india in respons to climat chang from there the genu giraffa evolv and around mya enter africa further climat chang caus the extinct of the asian giraff while the african giraff surviv and radiat into sever new speci live giraff appear to have arisen around mya in eastern africa dure the pleistocen some biologist suggest the modern giraff descend from g juma other find g gracili a more like candid g juma wa larger and more heavili built while g gracili wa smaller and more lightli built the main driver for the evolut of the giraff is believ to have been the chang from extens forest to more open habitat which began mya dure thi time tropic plant disappear and were replac by arid plant and a dri savannah emerg across eastern and northern africa and western india some research have hypothesis that thi new habitat coupl with a differ diet includ acacia speci may have expos giraff ancestor to toxin that caus higher mutat rate and a higher rate of evolut the coat pattern of modern giraff may also have coincid with these habitat chang asian giraff are hypothesis to have had more colourationsth giraff genom is around billion base pair in length compar to the billion base pair of the okapi of the protein in giraff and okapi gene are ident

mostli gray or tan it thick allow the anim to run through thorn bush without be punctur the fur may serv as a chemic defenc as it parasit repel give the anim a characterist scent at least main aromat chemic are in the fur although indol and are respons for most of the smell becaus the male have a stronger odour than the femal the odour may also have sexual function along the anim neck is a mane made of short erect hair the tail end in a long dark tuft of hair and is use as a defens against insect skull and ossicon both sex have promin structur call ossicon which are form from ossifi cartilag cover in skin and fuse to the skull at the pariet bone be vascular the ossicon may have a role in thermoregul and are also use in combat between male appear is a reliabl guid to the sex or age of a giraff the ossicon of femal and young are thin and display tuft of hair on top wherea those of adult male end in knob and tend to be bald on top also a median lump which is more promin in male emerg at the front of the skull male develop calcium deposit that form bump on their skull as they age a giraff skull is lighten by multipl sinus howev as male age their skull becom heavier and more help them becom more domin in combat the upper jaw ha a groov palat and lack front teeth the giraff molar have a rough surfac leg locomot and postur the front and back leg of a giraff are about the same length the radiu and ulna of the front leg are articul by the carpu which while structur equival to the human wrist function as a knee it appear that a suspensori ligament allow the lanki leg to support the anim great weight the foot of the giraff reach a diamet of cm in and the hoof is cm in high in male and cm in in femal the rear of each hoof is low and the fetlock is close to the ground allow the foot to provid addit support to the anim weight giraff lack dewclaw and interdigit gland the giraff pelvi though rel short ha an ilium that is outspread at the upper endsa giraff ha onli two gait walk and gallop walk is done by move the leg on one side of the bodi at the same time then do the same on the other side when gallop the hind leg move around the front leg befor the latter move forward and the tail will curl up the anim reli on the forward and backward motion of it head and neck to maintain balanc and the counter momentum while gallop the giraff can reach a sprint speed of up to mph and can sustain mph for sever kilometresa giraff rest by lie with it bodi on top of it fold leg to lie down the anim kneel on it front leg and then lower the rest of it bodi to get back up it first get on it knee and spread it hind leg to rais it hindquart it then straighten it front leg with each step the anim swing it head in captiv the giraff sleep intermitt around hour per day mostli at night it usual sleep lie down howev stand sleep have been record particularli in older individu intermitt short deep sleep phase while lie are characteris by the giraff bend it neck backward and rest it head on the hip or thigh a posit believ to indic paradox sleep if the giraff want to bend down to drink it either spread it front leg or bend it knee giraff would probabl not be compet swimmer as their long leg would be highli cumbersom in the water although they could possibl float when swim the thorax would be weigh down by the front leg make it difficult for the anim to move it neck and leg in harmoni or keep it head abov the surfac neck the giraff ha an extrem elong neck which can be up to m ft in length account for much of the anim vertic height the long neck result from a disproportion lengthen of the cervic vertebra not from the addit of more vertebra each cervic vertebra is over cm in long they compris per cent of the length of the giraff vertebr column compar with the percent typic of similar larg ungul includ the giraff closest live rel the okapi thi elong larg take place after birth perhap becaus giraff mother would have a difficult time give birth to young with the same neck proport as adult the giraff head and neck are held up by larg muscl and a strengthen nuchal ligament which are anchor by long dorsal spine on the anterior thorac vertebra give the anim a hump the giraff neck vertebra have ball and socket joint in particular the joint and allow the anim to tilt it head vertic and reach more branch with the tongu the point of articul between the cervic and thorac vertebra of giraff is shift to lie between the first and second thorac vertebra and unlik most other rumin where the articul is between the seventh cervic vertebra and thi allow to contribut directli to increas neck length and ha given rise to the suggest that is actual and that giraff have ad an extra cervic vertebra howev thi proposit is not gener accept as ha other morpholog featur such as an articul rib deem diagnost of thorac vertebra and becaus except to the mammalian limit of seven cervic vertebra are gener characteris by increas neurolog anomali and maladiesther are sever hypothes regard the evolutionari origin and mainten of elong in giraff neck the compet browser hypothesi wa origin suggest by charl darwin and challeng onli recent it suggest that competit pressur from smaller browser such as kudu steenbok and impala encourag the elong of the neck as it enabl giraff to reach food that competitor could not thi advantag is real as giraff can and do feed up to m ft high while even quit larg competitor such as kudu can feed up to onli about m ft in high there is also research suggest that brows competit is intens at lower level and giraff feed more effici gain more leaf biomass with each mouth high in the canopi howev scientist disagre about just how much time giraff spend feed at level beyond the reach of other browser and a studi found that adult giraff with longer neck actual suffer higher mortal rate under drought condit than their counterpart thi studi suggest that maintain a longer neck requir more nutrient which put giraff at risk dure a food shortageanoth theori the sexual select hypothesi propos that the long neck evolv as a secondari sexual characterist give male an advantag in neck contest see below to establish domin and obtain access to sexual recept femal in support of thi theori neck are longer and heavier for male than femal of the same age and the former do not employ other form of combat howev one object is that it fail to explain whi femal giraff also have long neck it ha also been propos that the neck serv to give the anim greater vigil intern system in mammal the left recurr laryng nerv is longer than the right in the giraff it is over cm in longer these nerv are longer in the giraff than in ani other live anim the left nerv is over m ft in long each nerv cell in thi path begin in the brainstem and pass down the neck along the vagu nerv then branch off into the recurr laryng nerv which pass back up the neck to the larynx thu these nerv cell have a length of nearli m ft in the largest giraff the structur of a giraff brain resembl that of domest cattl it is kept cool by evapor heat loss in the nasal passag the shape of the skeleton give the giraff a small lung volum rel to it mass it long neck give it a larg amount of dead space in spite of it narrow windpip these factor increas the resist to airflow nevertheless the anim can still suppli enough oxygen to it tissu and it can increas it respiratori rate and oxygen diffus when run the circulatori system of the giraff ha sever adapt for it great height it heart which can weigh more than kg lb and measur about cm ft long must gener approxim doubl the blood pressur requir for a human to maintain blood flow to the brain as such the wall of the heart can be as thick as cm in giraff have unusu high heart rate for their size at beat per minut when the anim lower it head the blood rush down fairli unoppos and a rete mirabil in the upper neck with it larg cross section area prevent excess blood flow to the brain when it rais again the blood vessel constrict and direct blood into the brain so the anim doe not faint the jugular vein contain sever most commonli seven valv to prevent blood flow back into the head from the inferior vena cava and right atrium while the head is lower convers the blood vessel in the lower leg are under great pressur becaus of the weight of fluid press down on them to solv thi problem the skin of the lower leg is thick and tight prevent too much blood from pour into themgiraff have oesophag muscl that are unusu strong to allow regurgit of food from the stomach up the neck and into the mouth for rumin they have four chamber stomach as in all rumin and the first chamber ha adapt to their special diet the intestin of an adult giraff measur more than m ft in length and have a rel small ratio of small to larg intestin the liver of the giraff is small and compact a gallbladd is gener present dure fetal life but it may disappear befor birth behaviour and ecolog habitat and feed giraff usual inhabit savannah and open woodland they prefer acaciea commiphora combretum and open terminalia woodland over denser environ like brachystegia woodland the angolan giraff can be found in desert environ giraff brows on the twig of tree prefer tree of the subfamili acaciea and the genera commiphora and terminalia which are import sourc of calcium and protein to sustain the giraff growth rate they also feed on shrub grass and fruit a giraff eat around kg lb of foliag daili when stress giraff may chew the bark off branch although herbivor the giraff ha been known to visit carcass and lick dri meat off bonesdur the wet season food is abund and giraff are more spread out while dure the dri season they gather around the remain evergreen tree and bush mother tend to feed in open area presum to make it easier to detect predat although thi may reduc their feed effici as a rumin the giraff first chew it food then swallow it for process and then visibl pass the cud up the neck and back into the mouth to chew again it is common for a giraff to saliv while feed the giraff requir less food than mani other herbivor becaus the foliag it eat ha more concentr nutrient and it ha a more effici digest system the anim faec come in the form of small pellet when it ha access to water a giraff drink at interv no longer than three daysgiraff have a great effect on the tree that they feed

rumin rumin is the domin activ dure the night when it is mostli done lie down social life giraff are usual found in group that vari in size and composit accord to ecolog anthropogen tempor and social factor tradit the composit of these group had been describ as open and for research purpos a group ha been defin as a collect of individu that are less than a kilometr apart and move in the same gener direct more recent studi have found that giraff have social associ and may form group or pair base on kinship sex or other factor these group may regularli associ with one anoth in larger commun or within a societi the number of giraff in a group can rang up to individu giraff group tend to be although group made of adult femal and young male are known to occur particularli stabl giraff group are those made of mother and their young which can last week or month social cohes in these group is maintain by the bond form between calv femal associ appear to be base on and individu may be matrilin relat in gener femal are more select than male in who they associ with in regard to individu of the same sex young male also form group and will engag in playfight howev as they get older

reproduct and parent care reproduct in giraff is broadli polygam a few older male mate with the fertil femal male giraff assess femal fertil by tast the femal urin to detect oestru in a process known as the flehmen respons male prefer young adult femal over juvenil and older adult onc an oestrou femal is detect the male will attempt to court her when court domin male will keep subordin one at bay a court male may lick a femal tail rest hi head and neck on her bodi or nudg her with hi horn dure copul the male stand on hi hind leg with hi head held up and hi front leg rest on the femal

spermatogenesi in male giraff begin at three to four year of age male must wait until they are at least seven year old to gain the opportun to mate neck male giraff use their neck as weapon in combat a behaviour known as neck neck is use to establish domin and male that win neck bout have greater reproduct success thi behaviour occur at low or high intens in low intens neck the combat rub and lean against each other the male that can hold itself more erect win the bout in high intens neck the combat will spread their front leg and swing their neck at each other attempt to land blow with their ossicon the contest will tri to dodg each other blow and then get readi to counter the power of a blow depend on the weight of the skull and the arc of the swing a neck duel can last more than half an hour depend on how well match the combat are although most fight do not lead to seriou injuri there have been record of broken jaw broken neck and even deathsaft a duel it is common for two male
