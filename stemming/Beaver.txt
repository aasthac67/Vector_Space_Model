front teeth to cut tree and other plant that they use both for build and for food in the absenc of exist pond beaver must construct dam befor build their lodg first they place vertic pole then fill between the pole with a crisscross of horizont place branch they fill in the gap between the branch with a combin of weed and mud until the dam impound suffici water to surround the lodg they are
