a dragonfli is an insect belong to the order odonata infraord anisoptera from greek aniso aniso unequ and pteron pteron wing becaus the hindw is broader than the forew adult dragonfli are character by larg multifacet eye two pair of strong transpar wing sometim with colour patch and an elong bodi dragonfli can be mistaken for the relat group damselfli zygoptera which are similar in structur though usual lighter in build howev the wing of most dragonfli are held flat and away from the bodi while damselfli hold the wing fold at rest along or abov the abdomen dragonfli are agil flier while damselfli have a weaker flutteri flight mani dragonfli have brilliant iridesc or metal colour produc by structur color make them conspicu in flight an adult dragonfli compound eye have nearli ommatidia each fossil of veri larg dragonfli ancestor in the protodonata are found from million year ago mya in upper carbonifer rock these had wingspan up to about mm in there are about extant speci most are tropic with fewer speci in temper region loss of wetland habitat threaten dragonfli popul around the world dragonfli are predat both in their aquat larval stage when they are known as nymph or naiad and as adult sever year of their live are spent as nymph live in fresh water the adult may be on the wing for just a few day or week they are fast agil flier sometim migrat across ocean and often live near water they have a uniqu complex mode of reproduct involv indirect insemin delay fertil and sperm competit dure mate the male grasp the femal at the back of the head and the femal curl her abdomen under her bodi to pick up sperm from the male secondari genitalia at the front of hi abdomen form the heart or wheel postur dragonfli are repres in human cultur on artifact such as potteri rock paint statu and art nouveau jewelri they are use in tradit medicin in japan and china and caught for food in indonesia they are symbol of courag strength and happi in japan but seen as sinist in european folklor their bright colour and agil flight are admir in the poetri of lord tennyson and the prose of h e bate phylogeni dragonfli and their rel are an ancient group the oldest fossil are of the protodonata from the mya upper carbonifer of europ a group that includ the largest insect that ever live meganeuropsi permiana from the earli permian with a wingspan around mm in their fossil record end with the extinct event about mya the protanisoptera anoth ancestr group which lack certain wing vein charact found in modern odonata live from the earli to late permian age until the end permian event and are known from fossil wing from current day unit state russia and australia suggest they might have been cosmopolitan in distribut the forerunn of modern odonata are includ in a clade call the panodonata which includ the basal zygoptera damselfli and the anisoptera true dragonfli today there are some speci extant around the worldth relationship of anisopteran famili are not fulli resolv as of but all the famili are monophylet except the corduliida the gomphida are a sister taxon to all other anisoptera the austropetaliida are sister to the aeshnoidea and the

have slender bodi and fli more weakli most speci fold their wing over the abdomen when stationari and the eye are well separ on the side of the headan adult dragonfli ha three distinct segment the head thorax and abdomen as in all insect it ha a chitin exoskeleton of hard plate held togeth with flexibl membran the head is larg with veri short antenna it is domin by the two compound eye which cover most of it surfac the compound eye are made up of ommatidia the number be greater in the larger speci aeshna interrupta ha ommatidia of two vari size be larg the facet face downward tend to be smaller petalura gigantea ha ommatidia of just one size these facet provid complet vision in the frontal hemispher of the dragonfli the compound eye meet at the top of the head except in the petalurida and gomphida as also in the genu epiophlebia also they have three simpl eye or ocelli the mouthpart are adapt for bite with a tooth jaw the labrum at the front of the mouth can be shot rapidli forward to catch prey the head ha a system for lock it in place that consist of muscl and small hair on the back of the head that grip structur on the front of the first thorac segment thi arrest system is uniqu to the odonata and is activ when feed and dure tandem flight the thorax consist of three segment as in all insect the prothorax is small and is flatten dorsal into a disc which ha two transvers ridg the mesothorax and metathorax are fuse into a rigid structur with intern brace and provid a robust attach for the power wing muscl insid it the thorax bear two pair of wing and three pair of leg the wing are long vein and membran narrow at the tip and wider at the base the hindw are broader than the forew and the venat is differ at the base the vein carri haemolymph which is analog to blood in vertebr and carri out mani similar function but which also serv a hydraul function to expand the bodi between nymphal stage instar and to expand and stiffen the wing after the adult emerg from the final nymphal stage the lead edg of each wing ha a node where other vein join the margin vein and the wing is abl to flex at thi point in most larg speci of dragonfli the wing of femal are shorter and broader than those of male the leg are rare use for walk but are use to catch and hold prey for perch and for climb on plant each ha two short basal joint two long joint and a foot arm with a pair of claw the long leg joint bear row of spine and in male one row of spine on each front leg is modifi to form an eyebrush for clean the surfac of the compound eye the abdomen is long and slender and consist of segment there are three termin appendag on segment a pair of superior clasper and an inferior the second and third segment are enlarg and in male on the undersid of the second segment ha a cleft form the secondari genitalia consist of lamina hamul genit lobe and peni there are remark variat in the presenc and the form of the peni and the relat structur the flagellum cornua and genit lobe sperm is produc at the segment and is transfer to the secondari genitalia prior to mate the male hold the femal behind the head use a pair of clasper on the termin segment in femal the genit open is on the undersid of the eighth segment and is cover by a simpl flap vulvar lamina or an ovipositor depend on speci and the method of dragonfli have simpl flap shed the egg in water mostli in flight dragonfli have ovipositor use it to punctur soft tissu of plant and place the egg singli in each punctur they madedragonfli nymph vari in form with speci and are loos class into clasper sprawler hider and burrow the first instar is known as a prolarva a rel inact stage from which it quickli moult into the more activ nymphal form the gener bodi plan is similar to that of an adult but the nymph lack wing and reproduct organ the lower jaw ha a huge extens labium arm with hook and spine which is use for catch prey thi labium is fold under the bodi at rest and struck out at great

brown hawker aeshna grandi have transluc pale yellow wingsdragonfli nymph are usual a blend of dull brown green and grey biolog ecolog dragonfli and damselfli are predatori both in the aquat nymphal and adult stage nymph feed on a rang of freshwat invertebr and larger one can prey on tadpol and small fish adult captur insect prey in the air make use of their acut vision and highli control flight the mate system of dragonfli is complex and they are among the few insect group that have a system of indirect sperm transfer along with sperm storag delay fertil and sperm competitionadult male vigor

dragonfli is a complex precis choreograph process first the male ha to attract a femal to hi territori continu drive off rival male when he is readi to mate he transfer a packet of sperm from hi primari genit open on segment near the end of hi abdomen to hi secondari genitalia on segment near the base of hi abdomen the male then grasp the femal by the head with the clasper at the end of hi abdomen the structur of the clasper vari between speci and may help to prevent interspecif mate the pair fli in tandem with the male in front typic perch on a twig or plant stem the femal then curl her abdomen downward and forward under her bodi to pick up the sperm from the male secondari genitalia while the male use hi tail clasper to grip the femal behind the head thi distinct postur is call the heart or wheel the pair may also be describ as be in cop oviposit involv not onli the femal dart over float or watersid veget to deposit egg on a suitabl substrat but also the male hover abov her
