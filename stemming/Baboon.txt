baboon are primat compris the genu papio one of the genera of old world monkey there are five speci of baboon commonli known as hamadrya baboon guinea baboon oliv baboon yellow baboon and chacma baboon each speci is nativ to one of five area of africa and the hamadrya baboon is also nativ to part of the arabian peninsula baboon are among the largest primat and have exist for at least two million year baboon vari in size and weight depend on the speci the smallest the kinda baboon is cm in in length and weigh onli kg lb while the largest the chacma baboon is up to cm in in length and weigh kg lb all baboon have long muzzl heavi power jaw with sharp canin teeth eye thick fur except on their muzzl short tail and nerveless hairless pad of skin on their protrud buttock call ischial callos that provid for sit comfort male hamadrya baboon have larg white mane baboon exhibit sexual dimorph in size colour canin teeth develop baboon have diurnal and are terrestri but sleep in tree or on high cliff or rock at night away from predat they are found in open savannah and woodland across africa they are omnivor common sourc of food are grass seed root leav bark variou fruit insect fish shellfish rodent bird vervet monkey and small antelop their princip predat are nile crocodil leopard lion and hyena most baboon live in hierarch troop contain harem baboon can determin from vocal exchang what the domin relat are between individu in gener each male can mate with ani femal the mate order among the male depend partli on their social rank femal typic give birth after a gestat usual to one infant the femal tend to be the primari caretak of the young although sever femal may share the duti for all of their offspr offspr are wean after about a year they reach sexual matur around five to eight year male leav their birth group usual befor they reach sexual matur wherea most femal stay in the same group for their live baboon in captiv live up to year while in the wild they averag between to year taxonomi five speci of papio are commonli recogn although there is some disagr about whether they are realli full speci or subspeci they are p ursinu chacma baboon found in southern africa p papio western red or guinea baboon found in the far western africa p hamadrya hamadrya baboon found in the horn of africa and southwestern arabia p anubi oliv baboon found in the african savanna and p cynocephalu yellow baboon found in and eastern africa the five speci of baboon in the genu papio are hamadrya baboon papio hamadrya guinea baboon papio papio oliv baboon papio

chacma papio ursinu ursinu chacma papio ursinu griseip ruacana chacma papio ursinu raucanamani author distinguish p hamadrya as a full speci but regard all the other as subspeci of p cynocephalu and refer to them collect as savanna baboon thi may not be help it is base on the argument that the hamadrya baboon is behavior and physic distinct from other baboon speci and that thi reflect a separ evolutionari histori howev recent morpholog and genet studi of papio show the hamadrya baboon to be more close relat to the northern baboon speci the guinea and oliv baboon than to the southern speci the yellow and chacma baboon the tradit classif probabl the variat within papio some comment argu that at least two more form should be recogn includ the tini kinda baboon p cynocephalu kinda from zambia dr congo and angola and the baboon p ursinu griseip found in zambia botswana zimbabw mozambiqu and northern south africa howev current knowledg of the morpholog genet and behavior divers within papio is too poor to make ani final comprehens judgment on thi matter phylogeni in research found the oldest baboon fossil date million year ago characterist all baboon have long muzzl heavi power jaw with sharp canin teeth eye thick fur except on their muzzl short tail and rough spot on their protrud buttock call ischial callos these callus are nerveless hairless pad of skin that provid for the

time throughout the day and night they often raid human dwell and in south africa they have been known to prey on sheep goat and poultri predat their princip predat are nile crocodil lion spot and stripe hyena leopard and cheetah they are consid a difficult prey for the leopard though which is mostli a threat to young baboon larg male will often confront them by flash their eyelid show their teeth by yawn make gestur and chase after the although they are not a prey speci baboon have been kill by the black mamba snake thi usual occur when a baboon accident rous the snake social system the collect noun for baboon is troop most baboon live in hierarch troop group size are typic around anim but can vari between and depend on speci locat and time of year the structur within the troop vari consider between hamadrya baboon and the remain speci sometim collect refer to as savanna baboon the hamadrya baboon often appear in veri larg group compos of mani smaller harem one male with four or so femal to which femal from elsewher in the troop are recruit while they are still too young to breed other baboon speci have a more promiscu structur with a strict domin hierarchi base on the matrilin the hamadrya baboon group will typic includ a younger male but he will not attempt to mate with the femal unless the older male is remov in the harem of the hamadrya baboon the male jealous guard their femal to the point of grab and bite the femal when they wander too far away despit thi some male will raid harem for femal such situat often caus aggress fight between the male visual threat usual accompani these aggress fight these includ a quick flash of the eyelid accompani by a yawn to show off the teeth some male succeed in take a femal from anoth harem call a takeov in sever speci infant baboon are taken by the male as hostag or use as shield dure fight baboon can determin from vocal exchang what the domin relat are between individu when a confront occur between differ famili or where a baboon take the offens baboon show more interest in thi exchang than those between member of the same famili or when a baboon take the offens thi is becaus confront between differ
