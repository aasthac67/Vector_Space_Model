bodi and a point of attach for muscl in contrast to the intern skeleton of human and other vertebr insect do not have lung oxygen and other gase such as carbon dioxid pass through their exoskeleton via tini valv call spiracl insect also lack close blood vessel instead they have a long thin perfor tube along the top of the bodi call the dorsal aorta that function like a heart and pump haemolymph toward the head thu drive the circul of the intern fluid the nervou system consist of a ventral nerv cord that run the length of the bodi with sever ganglia and branch along the way reach into the
