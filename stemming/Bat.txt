have a slightli lower break stress point than those of birdsa in other mammal and unlik in bird the radiu is the main compon of the forearm bat have five elong digit which all radiat around the wrist the thumb point forward and support the lead edg of the wing and the other digit support the tension held in the wing membran the second and third digit go along the wing tip allow the wing to be pull forward against aerodynam drag without have to be thick as in pterosaur wing the fourth and fifth digit go from the wrist to the trail edg and repel the bend forc caus by air push up against the stiff membran due to their flexibl joint bat are more manoeuvr and more dexter than glide mammal the wing of bat are much thinner and consist of more bone than the wing of bird allow bat to manoeuvr more accur than the latter and fli with more lift and less drag by fold the wing in toward their bodi on the upstrok they save percent energi dure flight the membran are delic tear easili but can regrow and small tear heal quickli the surfac of the wing is equip with receptor on small bump call merkel cell also found on human fingertip these sensit area are differ in bat as each bump ha a tini hair in the centr make it even more sensit and allow the bat to detect and adapt to chang airflow the primari use is to judg the most effici speed to fli at and possibl also to avoid stall insectivor bat may also use tactil hair to help perform complex manoeuvr to captur prey in flight the patagium is the wing membran it is stretch between the arm and finger bone and down the side of the bodi to the hind limb and tail thi skin membran consist of connect tissu elast fibr nerv muscl and blood vessel the muscl keep the membran taut dure flight the extent to which the tail of a bat is attach to a

bat the rel alveolar surfac area and pulmonari capillari blood volum are larger than in most other small quadruped mammal dure flight the respiratori cycl ha a relationship with the cycl becaus of the restraint of the mammalian lung bat can not maintain flight it take a lot of energi and an effici circulatori system to work the flight muscl of bat energi suppli to the muscl engag in flight requir about doubl the amount compar to the muscl that do not use flight as a mean of mammalian locomot in parallel to energi consumpt blood oxygen level of fli anim are twice as much as those of their terrestri locomot mammal as the blood suppli control the amount of oxygen suppli throughout the bodi the circulatori system must respond accordingli therefor compar to a terrestri mammal of the same
