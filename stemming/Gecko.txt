gecko are small lizard belong to the infraord gekkota found in warm climat throughout the world they rang from to cm to inch most gecko can not blink but they often lick their eye to keep them clean and moist they have a fix len within each iri that enlarg in dark to let in more light gecko are uniqu among lizard for their vocal which differ from speci to speci most gecko in the famili gekkonida use chirp or click sound in their social interact tokay gecko gekko gecko are known for their loud mate call and some other speci are capabl of make hiss nois when alarm or threaten they are the most group of lizard with about differ speci worldwid the new latin gekko and english gecko stem from the gekoq which is imit of sound that some speci makeal gecko except speci in the famili eublepharida lack eyelid instead the outer surfac of the eyebal ha a transpar membran the cornea speci without eyelid gener lick their own cornea when they need to clear them of dust and dirtnocturn speci have excel night vision their color vision in low light is time more sensit than human color vision the nocturn gecko evolv from diurnal speci which had lost the eye rod the gecko eye therefor modifi it cone that increas in size into differ type both singl and doubl three differ photopig have been retain and are sensit to uv blue and green they also use a multifoc optic system that allow them to

more difficult for gecko to adher to than mani other surfac gecko adhes is typic improv by higher humid even on hydrophob surfac yet is reduc under condit of complet immers in water the role of water in that system is under discuss yet recent experi agre that the presenc of molecular water layer water molecul carri a veri larg dipol moment on the seta as well as on the surfac increas the surfac

peel their toe off surfac from the tip inward in essenc by thi peel action the gecko separ spatula by spatula from the surfac so for each spatula separ onli some forc necessari the process is similar to remov scotch tape from a surfac gecko toe oper well below their full attract capabl most of the time becaus the margin for error is great depend upon the surfac rough and therefor the number of
