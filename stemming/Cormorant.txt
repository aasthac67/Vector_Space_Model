phalacrocoracida is a famili of approxim speci of aquat bird commonli known as cormor and shag sever differ classif of the famili have been propos recent and the number of genera is disput the great cormor p carbo and the common shag p aristot are the onli two speci of the famili commonli encount on the british isl and cormor and shag appel have been later assign to differ speci in the famili somewhat haphazardli cormor and shag are bird with bodi weight in the rang of kilogram lb and wing span of centimetr in the major of speci have dark feather the bill is long thin and hook their feet have web between all four toe all speci are catch the prey by dive from the surfac they are excel diver and under water they propel themselv with their feet with help from their wing some cormor speci have been found to dive as deep as metr ft they have rel short wing due to their need for econom movement underwat and consequ have the highest flight cost of ani fli birdcormor nest in coloni around the shore on tree islet or cliff they are coastal rather than ocean bird and some have colonis inland water inde the origin ancestor of cormor seem to have been a bird they rang around the world except for the central pacif island name no consist distinct exist between cormor and shag the name and were origin the common name of the two speci of the famili found in great britain phalacrocorax carbo now refer to by ornithologist as the great cormor and p aristot the european shag shag refer to the bird crest which the british form of the great cormor lack as other speci were encount by sailor and explor elsewher in the world some were call cormor and some shag depend on whether they had crest or not sometim the same speci is call a cormor in one part of the world and a shag in anoth eg the great cormor is call the black shag in new zealand the bird found in australasia have a crest that is absent in european member of the speci van tet propos to divid the famili into two genera and attach the name cormor to one and shag to the other but thi fli in the face of common usag and ha not been wide adopt the scientif genu name is latinis ancient greek from phalakro phalakro bald and korax korax raven thi is often thought to refer to the creami white patch on the cheek of adult great cormor or the ornament white head plume promin in mediterranean bird of thi speci but is certainli not a unifi characterist of cormor cormor is a contract deriv either directli from latin corvu marinu sea raven or through brython celtic cormoran is the cornish name of the sea giant in the tale of jack the giant killer inde sea raven or analog term were the usual term for cormor in german languag until after the middl age the french explor andr thevet comment in the beak is similar to that of a cormor or other corvid which demonstr that the erron belief that the bird were relat to raven last at least to the centuri descript cormor and shag are seabird they rang in size from the pygmi cormor phalacrocorax pygmaeu at as littl as cm in and g oz to the flightless cormor phalacrocorax harrisi at a maximum size cm in and kg lb the recent extinct spectacl cormor phalacrocorax perspicillatu wa rather larger at an averag size of kg lb the major includ nearli all northern hemispher speci have mainli dark plumag but some southern hemispher speci are black and white and a few eg the spot shag of new zealand are quit colour mani speci have area of colour skin on the face the lore and the gular skin which can be bright blue orang red or yellow typic becom more brightli colour in the breed season the bill is long thin and sharpli hook their feet have web between all four toe as in their rel habitat they are coastal rather than ocean bird and some have colonis inland water inde the origin ancestor of cormor seem to have been a bird judg from the habitat of the most ancient lineag they rang around the world except for the central pacif island behaviour all are dine on small eel fish and even water snake they dive from the surfac though mani speci make a characterist as they dive presum to give themselv a more streamlin entri into the water under water they propel themselv with their feet though some also propel themselv with their wing see the pictur commentari and exist refer video some cormor speci have been found use depth gaug to dive to depth of as much as metr ft after fish cormor go ashor and are frequent seen hold their wing out in the sun all cormor have preen gland secret that are use ostens to keep the feather waterproof some sourc state that cormor have waterproof feather while other say that they have feather still other suggest that the outer plumag absorb water but doe not permit it to penetr the layer of air next to the skin the wing dri action is seen even in the flightless cormor but commonli in the antarct shag and cormor altern function suggest for the postur includ that it aid thermoregul or digest balanc the bird or indic presenc of fish a detail studi of the great cormor conclud that it is without doubt to dri the plumagecormor are coloni nester use tree rocki islet or cliff the egg are a colour there is usual one brood a year parent regurgit food to feed their young whose deep ungainli bill show a greater resembl to those of the pelican to which they are relat than is obviou in the adult taxonomi the cormor are a group tradit place within the pelecaniform or in the taxonomi the expand ciconiiform thi latter group is certainli not a natur one and even after the tropicbird have been recognis as quit distinct the remain pelecaniform seem not to be entir monophylet their relationship and delimit apart from be part of a higher waterfowl clade which is similar but not ident to sibley and ahlquist remain mostli unresolv notwithstand all evid agre that the cormor and shag are closer to the darter and sulida gannet and boobi and perhap the pelican or even penguin than to all other live birdsin recent year three prefer treatment of the cormor famili have emerg either to leav all live cormor in a singl genu phalacrocorax or to split off a few speci such as the imperi shag complex in leucocarbo and perhap the flightless cormor altern the genu may be disassembl altogeth and in the most extrem case be reduc to the great and japanes cormorantspend a thorough review of the recent and prehistor cormor the approach is follow here for three reason first it is prefer to tent assign genera without a robust hypothesi second it make it easier to deal with the fossil form the systemat treatment of which ha been no less controversi than that of live cormor and shag third thi scheme is also use by the iucn make it easier to incorpor data on statu and conserv in accord with the treatment there the imperi shag complex is here left unsplit as well but the king shag complex ha been the cormor and the darter have a uniqu bone on the back of the top of the skull known as the os

fossil record cormor seem to be a veri ancient group with similar ancestor reach back to the time of the dinosaur in fact the earliest known modern bird gansu yumenensi had essenti the same structur the detail of the evolut of the cormor are mostli unknown even the techniqu of use the distribut and relationship of a speci to figur out where it came from biogeographi usual veri inform doe not give

distribut henc at least the modern divers of sula probabl origin in the southern hemispher while the leucocarbonin are almost certainli of southern pacif even the antarct which at the time when cormor evolv wa not yet that can be said about the phalacrocoracin is that they are most divers in the region border the indian ocean but gener occur over a larg area similarli the origin of the famili is shroud in uncertainti some late cretac fossil have been propos to belong with the phalacrocoracida a scapula from the boundari about mya million year ago wa found in the nemegt format in mongolia it

not be assign to ani of the suloid and shag darter and gannet and certainti the best interpret is that the phalacrocoracida diverg from their closest ancestor in the earli oligocen perhap some million year ago and that the cretac fossil repres ancestr suloid pelecaniform or higher waterbird at least the last lineag is gener believ to have been alreadi distinct and undergo evolutionari radiat at the end of the cretac what can be said with near certainti is that amnh fr is from a dive bird that use it feet for underwat locomot as thi is liabl to result in some degre of converg evolut and the bone

the indian plate final attach to the mainland lack a detail studi it may well be that the first modern cormor were small speci from eastern or southern asia possibl live in freshwat habitat that
