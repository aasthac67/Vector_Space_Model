cassowari genu casuariu are ratit flightless bird without a keel on their sternum bone that are nativ to the tropic forest of new guinea papua new guinea and indonesia east nusa tenggara the maluku island and northeastern australiather are three extant speci the most common of these the southern cassowari is the and live bird smaller onli than the ostrich and emu cassowari feed mainli on fruit although all speci are truli omnivor and will take a rang of other plant food includ shoot and grass seed in addit to fungi invertebr and small vertebr cassowari are veri wari of human but if provok they are capabl of inflict seriou even fatal injuri to both dog and peopl the cassowari ha often been label the world most danger bird taxonomi systemat and evolut the genu casuariu wa erect by the french scientist mathurin jacqu brisson in hi ornithologi publish in the type speci is the southern cassowari casuariu casuariu the swedish naturalist carl linnaeu had introduc the genu casuariu in

struthio as the public date of linnaeu sixth edit wa befor the start point of the intern commiss on zoolog nomenclatur brisson and not linnaeu is consid as the author for the genuscassowari from malay kasuari are part of the ratit group which also includ the emu rhea ostrich and kiwi as well as the extinct moa and eleph bird three extant speci are recognis and one extinct most author consid the taxonom classif abov to be monotyp howev sever subspeci of each have been describ and some of them have even been suggest as separ speci eg c b papuanu the taxonom name c b papuanu also may be in need of revis to casuariu bennetti westermanni valid of these subspeci ha proven difficult due to individu variat variat the scarciti of specimen the stabil of specimen the bright skin of the head and basi of describ sever in specimen and the practic of trade live cassowari for thousand of year some of which are like to have escap or deliber introduc to region away from their origin the evolutionari histori of cassowari as of all ratit is not well known a fossil speci wa report from australia but for reason of biogeographi thi assign is not certain and it might belong to the prehistor emuariu which were primit emu all ratit are believ to have origin come from the gondwana which separ around million year ago studi show that ratit continu to evolv after thi separ into their modern counterpart descript typic all cassowari are shi bird that are found in the deep forest they are adept at disappear long befor a human know they were there the southern cassowari of the far north queensland rain forest is not well studi and the northern and dwarf cassowari even less so femal are larger and more brightli colour than the male adult southern cassowari are to m ft tall although some femal may reach m ft and weigh kg lb all cassowari have feather that consist of a shaft and loos barbul they do not have rectric tail feather or a preen gland cassowari have small wing with larg remig these are reduc to stiff keratin quill resembl porcupin quill with no barb a claw exist on each second digit of the feet the furcula and coracoid are degener and their palat bone and sphenoid bone touch each other these along with their bodi are thought to be adapt to ward off vine thorn and leav allow them to run quickli through the rainforest cassowari have feet with sharp claw the second toe the inner one in the medial posit sport a claw that may be mm in long thi claw is particularli fearsom sinc cassowari sometim kick human and other anim with their power leg cassowari can run at up to mph through the dens forest and can jump up to m ft they are good swimmer cross wide river and swim in the sea all three speci have a keratin casqu on their head that grow with age the casqu shape and size up to cm in is casuariu casuariu ha the largest and casuariu bennetti the smallest tricorn shape with casuariu unappendiculatu have variat in between contrari to earlier find the hollow insid of the casqu is span with fine fibr that are believ to have an acoust function sever function for the casqu have been propos one is that they are a secondari sexual characterist other suggest function includ be use to batter through underbrush as a weapon in domin disput or for push asid leaf litter dure forag the latter three are disput by biologist andrew mack whose person observ suggest that the casqu amplifi deep soundsearli research indic the bird lower their head when run full tilt through the veget brush sapl asid and occasion careen into small tree the casqu would help protect the skull from such collis cassowari eat fallen fruit and consequ spend much time under tree where seed the size of golfbal or larger fall from height of up to m ft the casqu may protect the head by deflect fall fruitit also ha been specul that the casqu play a role in either sound recept or acoust commun thi is relat to a discoveri that at least the dwarf cassowari and southern cassowari produc frequenc sound which may aid in commun in dens rainforest the boom vocalis that cassowari produc is the bird call known and is at the lower limit of human hear a cool function for the veri similar casqu of guineafowl ha been propos the averag lifespan of wild cassowari is believ to be about to year distribut and habitat cassowari are nativ to the humid rainforest of new guinea nearbi

territori for most of their live mate with the same or close relat male over the cours of their life span courtship and pair bond ritual begin with the vibratori sound broadcast by femal male approach and run with neck parallel to the ground while make dramat movement of the head which accentu the frontal neck region the femal approach drum slowli the male will crouch upon the ground and the femal will either step on the male back for a moment befor crouch besid him in prepar for copul or she may attack thi is often the case with the femal pursu the male in ritualist chase behaviour that gener

ritualist motion of her head the two may remain in copul for extend period of time in some case anoth male may approach and run off the first male he will climb onto her to copul as well male are far more toler of one anoth than femal which do not toler the presenc of other femal reproduct the cassowari breed season start in may to june femal lay three to eight larg bright green or pale egg in
