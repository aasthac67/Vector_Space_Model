organis to hunt for meat while a group consist of lactat femal serv to act as a nurseri group for the youngat the core of social structur are male which roam around protect group member and search for food male remain in their natal commun while femal gener emigr at adolesc as such male in a commun are more like to be relat to one anoth than femal are to each other among male there is gener a domin hierarchi and male are domin over femal howev thi unusu social structur in which portion of the parent group may on a regular basi separ from and then rejoin the rest is highli variabl in term of which particular individu chimpanze congreg at a given time thi is caus mainli by the larg measur of individu autonomi that individu have within their social group as a result individu chimpanze often forag for food alon or in smaller group as oppos to the much larger parent group which encompass all the chimpanze which regularli come into contact and congreg into parti in a particular area male chimpanze exist in a linear domin hierarchi male tend to be aggress even dure domin stabil thi is probabl due to the chimp societi with male chimp leav group and return after extend period of time

social structur is often refer to as patriarch it is not entir unheard of for femal to forg coalit against male there is also at least one record case of femal secur a domin posit over male in their
