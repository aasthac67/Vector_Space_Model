the cuckoo are a famili of bird cuculida the sole taxon in the order cuculiform the cuckoo famili includ the common or european cuckoo roadrunn koel malkoha coua coucal and ani the coucal and ani are sometim separ as distinct famili the centropodida and crotophagida respect the cuckoo order cuculiform is one of three that make up the otidimorpha the other two be the turaco and the bustard the cuckoo are gener slender bird most speci live in tree though a sizeabl minor are the famili ha a cosmopolitan distribut with the major of speci be tropic some speci are migratori the cuckoo feed on insect insect larva and a varieti of other anim as well as fruit some speci are brood parasit lay their egg in the nest of other speci but the major of speci rais their own young cuckoo have play a role in human cultur for thousand of year appear in greek mytholog as sacr to the goddess hera in europ the cuckoo is associ with spring and with cuckoldri for exampl in shakespear love labour lost in india cuckoo are sacr to kamadeva the god of desir and long wherea in japan the cuckoo symbolis unrequit love descript cuckoo are bird that rang in size from the littl bronz cuckoo at g and cm inch to the cuckoo at g lb and cm inch there is gener littl sexual dimorph in size but where it exist it can be either the male or the femal that is larger one of the most import distinguish featur of the famili are the feet which are zygodactyl mean that the two inner toe point forward and the two outer backward there are two basic bodi form arbor speci like the common cuckoo which are slender and have short tarsi and terrestri speci like the roadrunn which are more heavi set and have long tarsi almost all speci have long tail which are use for steer in terrestri speci and as a rudder dure flight in the arbor speci the wing shape also vari with lifestyl with the more migratori speci like the cuckoo possess long narrow wing capabl of strong direct flight and the more terrestri and sedentari cuckoo like the coucal and malkoha have shorter round wing and a more labour glide flightth subfamili cuculina are the cuckoo of the old world they tend to conform to the classic shape with usual long tail short leg long narrow wing and an arbor lifestyl the largest speci the cuckoo also ha the most outsiz bill in the famili resembl that of a hornbil the subfamili phaenicophaeina are the cuckoo of the old world and includ the coua malkoha and they are more terrestri cuckoo with strong and often long leg and short round wing the subfamili typic ha brighter plumag and brightli colour bare skin around the eye the coucal are anoth terrestri old world subfamili of long tail long leg and short wing cuckoo they are larg heavyset bird with the largest the greater black coucal be around the same size as the cuckoo the subfamili coccyzina are arbor and long tail as well with a number of larg insular form the new world ground cuckoo are similar to the asian in be long leg and terrestri and includ the long bill roadrunn which can reach speed of when chase prey the final subfamili are the atyp ani which includ the small clumsi ani and the larger guira cuckoo the ani have massiv bill and smooth glossi feather the feather of the cuckoo are gener soft and often becom waterlog in heavi rain cuckoo often sun themselv after rain and the ani hold their wing open in the manner of a vultur or cormor while dri there is consider variat in the plumag exhibit by the famili some speci particularli the brood parasit have cryptic plumag wherea other have bright and elabor plumag thi is particularli true of the chrysococcyx or glossi cuckoo which have iridesc plumag some cuckoo have a resembl to hawk in the genu accipit with bar on the undersid thi appar alarm potenti host allow the femal to access a host nest the young of some brood parasit are colour so as to resembl the young of the host for exampl the asian koel breed in india have black offspr to resembl their crow host wherea in the australian koel the chick are brown like the honeyeat host sexual dimorph in plumag is uncommon in the cuckoo be most common in the parasit old world speci cuckoo genera differ in the number of primari wing feather as below coccycua coccyzu phaenicophaeu piaya cuculu or pachycoccyx clamat levaillantii centropu microdynami eudynami clamat glandariu some coucal scythrop novaehollandia distribut and habitat the cuckoo have a cosmopolitan distribut rang across all the world contin except antarctica they are absent from the south west of south america the far north and north west of north america and the driest area of the middl east and north africa although they occur there as passag migrant they gener onli occur as vagrant in the ocean island of the atlant and indian ocean but one speci breed on a number of pacif island and anoth is a winter migrant across much of the pacificcuculina is the most widespread subfamili of cuckoo and is distribut across europ asia africa australia and oceania amongst the phaenicophaeina cuckoo the malkoha and asian are restrict to southern asia the coua are endem to madagascar and the yellowbil widespread across africa the coucal are distribut from africa through tropic asia down into australia and the solomon island the remain three subfamili have a new world distribut all three are found in both north and south america the coccyzina reach the furthest north of the three subfamili breed in canada wherea the ani reach as far north as florida and the typic the south west unit state for the cuckoo suitabl habitat provid a sourc of food princip insect and especi caterpillar and a place to breed for brood parasit the need is for suitabl habitat for the host speci cuckoo occur in a wide varieti of habitat the major of speci occur in forest and woodland princip in the evergreen rainforest of the tropic some speci inhabit or are even restrict to mangrov forest these includ the littl bronz cuckoo of australia some malkoha coucal and the mangrov cuckoo of the new world in addit to forest some speci of cuckoo occupi more open environ thi can includ even arid area like desert in the case of the greater roadrunn or the pallid cuckoo temper migratori speci like the common cuckoo inhabit a wide rang of habitat in order to make maximum use of the potenti brood host from reed bed where they parasitis reed warbler to treeless moor where they parasitis meadow pipit migrat most speci of cuckoo are sedentari but some undertak regular season migrat and other undertak partial migrat over part of their rang speci breed at higher latitud migrat to warmer climat dure the winter due to food avail the koel which breed in new zealand fli to it winter ground in polynesia micronesia and melanesia a feat describ as perhap the most remark overwat migrat of ani land bird the cuckoo and cuckoo breed in north america and fli across the caribbean sea a flight of km other long migrat flight includ the lesser cuckoo which fli from africa to india and the common cuckoo of europ which fli over the mediterranean sea and sahara desert on the voyag between europ and central africawithin africa ten speci make regular migrat that are describ as polaris that is they spend the season in the tropic centr of the contin and move north and south to breed in the more arid and open savannah and desert thi is the same as the situat in the neotrop where no speci have thi migrat pattern or tropic asia where a singl speci doe of the australian speci are partial migrant within australia or travel to new guinea and indonesia after the breed seasonin some speci the migrat is diurnal as in the cuckoo or nocturn as in the cuckoo behaviour and ecolog the cuckoo are for the most part solitari bird that seldom occur in pair or group the biggest except to thi are the ani of the america which have evolv cooper breed and other social behaviour for the most part the cuckoo are also diurnal as oppos to nocturn but mani speci call at night see below the cuckoo are also gener a shi and retir famili more often heard than seen the except to thi are again the ani which are often extrem trust toward human and other speci most cuckoo are insectivor and in particular are specialis in eat larger insect and caterpillar includ noxiou hairi type avoid by other bird they are unusu among bird in process their prey prior to swallow rub it back and forth on hard object such as branch and then crush it with special boni plate in the back of the mouth they also take a wide rang of other insect and anim prey the lizard cuckoo of the caribbean have in the rel absenc of bird of prey specialis in take lizard larger ground type such as coucal and roadrunn also feed various on snake lizard small rodent and other bird which they bludgeon with their strong bill ground speci may employ differ techniqu to catch prey a studi of two coua speci in madagascar found that the coquerel coua obtain prey by walk and glean on the forest floor wherea the coua ran and pounc on prey both speci also show season flexibl in prey and forag techniqu the parasit cuckoo are gener not record as particip in feed flock although some studi in eastern australia found sever speci particip in the season but were mob and unabl to do so in the breed season of the genu neomorphu are sometim seen feed in associ with armi ant swarm although they are not oblig as are some antbird the ani are ground feeder that follow cattl and other larg mammal when forag in a similar fashion to cattl egret they snatch prey flush by the cattl and enjoy higher forag success rate in thi waysever koel coua and the cuckoo feed mainli on fruit but they are not exclus frugivor the parasit koel and cuckoo in particular consum mainli fruit when rais by frugivor host such as the australasian figbird and pie currawong other speci occasion take fruit as well coua consum fruit in the dri season when prey is harder to find breed the cuckoo are an extrem divers group of bird with regard to breed system the major of speci are monogam but there are except the ani and the guira cuckoo lay their egg in commun nest which is built by all member of the group incub brood and territori defenc duti are share by all member of the group within these speci the ani breed as group of monogam pair but the guira cuckoo are not monogam within the group exhibit a polygynandr breed system thi group nest behaviour is not complet cooper femal compet and may remov other egg when lay her egg are usual onli eject earli in the breed season in the ani but can be eject at ani time by guria cuckoo polyandri ha been confirm in the african black coucal and is suspect to occur in the other coucal perhap explain the revers sexual dimorph in the groupth major of cuckoo speci includ malkoha coua coucal and roadrunn and most other american cuckoo build their own nest although a larg minor engag in brood parasit see below most of these speci nest in tree or bush but the coucal lay their egg in nest on the ground or in low shrub though on some occas cuckoo parasit other speci the parent still help feed the chick the nest of cuckoo vari in the same way as the breed system the nest of malkoha and asian ground cuckoo are shallow platform of twig but those of coucal are globular or dome nest of grass the new world cuckoo build saucer or bowl in the case of the new world ground cuckoo like most other lay white egg but mani of the parasit speci lay colour egg to match those of their passerin host the young of all speci are altrici cuckoo leav the nest befor they can fli and some new world speci have the shortest incub period among bird brood parasit about of the old world speci and of the new world speci pheasant pavonin and stripe are brood parasit lay their egg in the nest of other bird these speci are oblig brood parasit mean that they onli reproduc in thi fashion the exampl is the european common cuckoo in addit to the abov note speci yet other sometim engag in brood parasit lay their egg in the nest of member of their own speci in addit to rais their own young the shell of the egg of are usual thick they have two distinct layer with an outer chalki layer that is believ to provid resist to crack when the egg are drop in the host nest the cuckoo egg hatch earlier than the host and the cuckoo chick grow faster in most case the chick evict the egg or young of the host speci the chick ha no time to learn thi behavior so it must be an instinct pass on genet the chick encourag the host to keep pace with it high growth rate with it rapid beg call and the chick open mouth which serv as a sign stimulussinc oblig brood parasit need to success trick their host in order for them to reproduc they have evolv adapt at sever stage of breed howev there are high cost of parasit on the host lead to strong select on host to recogn and reject parasit egg the adapt and between host and parasit have led to a coevolut arm race thi mean that if one of the speci involv were to stop adapt it would lose the race to the other speci result in decreas fit of the lose speci the adapt is the best studi stage of thi arm race cuckoo have variou strategi for get their egg into host nest differ speci use differ strategi base on host defens strategi femal cuckoo have secret and fast lay behavior but in some case male have been shown to lure host adult away from their nest so that the femal can lay her egg in the nest some host speci may directli tri to prevent cuckoo lay egg in their nest in the first place bird whose nest are at high risk of are known to cuckoo to drive them out of the area parasit cuckoo are group into gent with each gen special in a particular host there is some evid that the gent are genet differ from one anoth femal parasit cuckoo sometim special and lay egg that close resembl the egg of their chosen host some bird are abl to distinguish cuckoo egg from their own lead to those egg least like the host be thrown out of the nest parasit cuckoo that show the highest level of egg mimicri are those whose host exhibit high level of egg reject behavior some host do not exhibit egg reject behavior and the cuckoo egg look veri dissimilar from the host egg it ha also been shown in a studi of the european common cuckoo that femal will lay their egg in the nest of a host that ha egg that look similar to it own other speci of cuckoo lay cryptic egg which are dark in color when their host egg are light thi is a trick to hide the egg from the host and is exhibit in cuckoo that parasit host with dark dome nest some adult parasit cuckoo complet destroy the host clutch if they reject the cuckoo egg in thi case rais the cuckoo chick is less of a cost than the altern total clutch destruct there are two main hypothes on the cognit mechan that mediat host distinguish of egg one hypothesi is true recognit which state that a host compar egg present in it clutch to an intern templat learnt or innat to identifi if parasit egg are present howev memor a templat of a parasit egg is costli and imperfect and like not ident to each host egg the other one is the discord hypothesi which state that host compar egg in the clutch and identifi the odd one howev if parasit egg made the major of egg in the clutch then host will end up reject their own egg more recent studi have found that it is more like that both mechan contribut to host discrimin of parasit egg sinc one compens for the limit of the otherth parasit is not necessarili entir detriment to the host speci a dataset wa use in to find that parasit crow nest were more success overal more like to produc at least one crow fledgl than nest the research attribut thi to a substanc secret by cuckoo chick when attack and note that the interact were not necessarili simpli parasit or mutualist call cuckoo are often highli secret and in mani case best known for their wide repertoir of call call are usual rel simpl resembl whistl flute or hiccup the call are use in order to demonstr ownership of a territori and to attract a mate within a speci the call are remark consist across the rang even in speci with veri larg rang thi suggest along with the fact that mani speci are not rais by their true parent that the call of cuckoo are innat and not learnt although cuckoo are diurnal mani speci call at nightth cuckoo famili get it english and scientif name from the call of the common cuckoo which is also familiar from cuckoo clock some of the name of other speci and genera are also deriv from their call for exampl the koel of
