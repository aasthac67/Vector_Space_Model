metamorphosi they belong to the mecopterida alongsid the mecoptera siphonaptera lepidoptera and trichoptera the possess of a singl pair of wing distinguish most true fli from other insect with fli in their name howev some true fli such as hippoboscida lous fli have becom secondarili winglessth cladogram repres the current consensu view relationship between fli subgroup and famili the first true dipteran known are from the middl triassic around million year ago and they becam widespread dure the middl and late triassic modern flower plant did not appear until the cretac around million year ago so the origin dipteran must have had a differ sourc of nutrit other than nectar base on the attract of mani modern fli group to shini droplet it ha been suggest that they may have fed on honeydew produc by bug which were abund at the time and dipteran mouthpart are to soften and lap up the crust residu the basal clade in the diptera includ the deuterophlebiida and the enigmat nymphomyiida three episod of evolutionari radiat are thought to have occur base on the fossil record mani new speci of lower diptera develop in the triassic about million year ago mani lower brachycera appear in the jurass some million year ago a third radiat took place among the schizophora at the start of the paleogen million year agoth phylogenet posit of diptera ha been controversi the monophyli of holometabol insect ha long been accept with the main order be establish as lepidoptera coleoptera hymenoptera and diptera and it is the relationship between these group which ha caus difficulti diptera is wide thought to be a member of mecopterida along with lepidoptera butterfli and moth trichoptera caddisfli siphonaptera flea mecoptera scorpionfli and possibl strepsiptera fli diptera ha been group with siphonaptera and mecoptera in the antliophora but thi ha not been confirm by molecular studiesdiptera were tradit broken down into two subord nematocera and brachycera distinguish by the differ in antenna the nematocera are identifi by their elong bodi and often featheri antenna as repres by mosquito and crane fli the brachycera have rounder bodi and much shorter antenna subsequ studi have identifi the nematocera as be with modern phylogeni place the brachycera within grade of group formerli place in the nematocera the construct of a phylogenet tree ha been the subject of

mani of these larva retract their head into their thorax some other anatom distinct exist between the larva of the nematocera and the brachycera especi in the brachycera littl demarc is seen between
