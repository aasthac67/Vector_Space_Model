with remedi that eas elimin of the hair through the gut as well as regular groom of the coat with a comb or stiff brush fight among domest cat male are more like to fight than femal among feral cat the most common reason for cat fight is competit between two male to mate with a femal in such case most fight are won by the heavier male anoth common reason for fight in domest cat is the difficulti

predat reduc the effect of predat by cat and other small predat such as opossum and raccoon on bird number and varieti perhap the element of cat hunt behavior which is commonli misunderstood and often appal cat owner becaus it look like tortur is that cat often appear to play with prey by releas it after captur thi cat and mous behavior is due to an instinct imper to ensur that the prey is weak enough to be kill without endang the cat anoth poorli understood element of cat hunt behavior is the present of prey to human guardian one explan is that cat adopt human into their social group and share excess kill with other in the group accord to the domin hierarchi in which human are react to as if they are at or near the top anoth explan is that they attempt to teach their guardian to hunt
