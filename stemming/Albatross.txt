speci found in hawaii one the albatross take mostli fish while the laysan feed on squidth use of data logger at sea that record ingest of water against time provid a like time of feed suggest that albatross predominantli feed dure the day analysi of the squid beak regurgit by albatross ha shown that mani of the squid eaten are too larg to have been caught aliv and includ speci like to be beyond the reach of albatross suggest that for some speci like the wander albatross scaveng squid may be an import part of the diet the sourc of these dead squid is a matter of debat some certainli come from squid fisheri but in natur it primarili come from the that occur after squid spawn and the vomit of whale sperm whale pilot whale and southern bottlenos whale the diet of other speci like the albatross or the albatross is rich with smaller speci of squid that tend to sink after death and scaveng is not assum to play a larg role in their diet the wave albatross ha been observ practis kleptoparasit harass boobi to steal their food make it the onli member of it order to do so regularlyuntil recent albatross were thought to be predominantli surfac feeder swim at the surfac and snap up squid and fish push to the surfac by current predat or death the deploy of capillari depth record which record the maximum dive depth undertaken by a bird ha shown that while some speci like the

even up to year for some speci young nonbreed attend a coloni prior to begin to breed spend mani year practis the elabor breed ritual and danc for which the famili is famou bird arriv back at the

origin appli to the frigatebird the modif to albatross wa perhap influenc by latin albu mean white in contrast to frigatebird which are black in modern portugues the word use for the bird albatroz is
