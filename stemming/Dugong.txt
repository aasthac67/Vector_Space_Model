their extinct rel sirenia are the onli extant herbivor marin mammal and the onli group of herbivor mammal to have becom complet aquat sirenian are thought to have a fossil record earli they attain modest divers dure the oligocen and miocen but subsequ declin as a result of climat cool oceanograph chang and human interfer etymolog and taxonomi the word dugong deriv from the visayan probabl cebuano dugung the name wa first adopt and popular by the french naturalist leclerc comt de buffon as dugon in histoir naturel after descript of the anim from the island of leyt in the philippin other common local name includ sea cow sea pig and sea camel dugong dugon is the onli extant speci of the famili dugongida and one of onli four extant speci of the sirenia order the other form the manate famili it wa first classifi by muller in as trichechu dugon a member of the manate genu previous defin by linnaeu it wa later assign as the type speci of dugong by laceped and further classifi within

aardvark one of the earliest offshoot of eutherian the fossil record show sirenian appear in the eocen where they most like live in the tethi ocean the two extant famili of sirenian are thought to have diverg in the after which the dugong and their closest rel the steller sea cow split off from a common ancestor in the miocen the steller sea cow becam extinct in the centuri no fossil exist of other member of the dugongidaemolecular studi have been made on dugong popul use mitochondri dna the result have suggest that the popul of southeast asia is distinct from the other australia ha two distinct matern lineag one of which also contain the dugong from africa and arabia limit genet mix ha taken place between those in southeast asia and those in australia mostli around timor one of the lineag stretch all the way from moreton bay to western australia while the other onli stretch from moreton bay to the northern territori there is not yet suffici genet data to make clear boundari between distinct group anatomi and morpholog the dugong bodi is larg with a cylindr shape that taper at both end it ha thick smooth skin that is a pale cream colour at birth but darken dorsal and later to with age the colour of a dugong can chang due to the growth of alga on the skin the bodi is spars cover in short hair a common featur among sirenian which may allow for tactil interpret of their environ these hair are most develop around the mouth which ha a larg upper lip form a highli mobil muzzl thi muscular upper lip aid the dugong in forag the dugong tail fluke and flipper are similar to those of dolphin these fluke are rais up and down in long stroke to move the anim forward and can be twist to turn the forelimb are flipper which aid in turn and slow the dugong lack nail on it flipper which are onli of a dugong bodi length the tail ha deep notchesa dugong brain weigh a maximum of g oz about of the anim bodi weight with veri small eye dugong have limit vision but acut hear within narrow sound threshold their ear which lack pinna are locat on the side of their head the nostril are locat on top of the head and can be close use valv dugong have two teat one locat behind each flipper there are few differ between sex the bodi structur are almost the same a male test are not extern locat and the main differ between male and femal is the locat of the genit apertur in relat to the umbilicu and the anu the lung in a dugong are veri long extend almost as far as the kidney which are also highli elong in order to cope with the saltwat environ if the dugong is wound it blood will clot rapidli the skull of a dugong is uniqu the skull is enlarg with sharpli premaxilla which are stronger in male the spine ha between and vertebra unlik in manate the dugong teeth do
