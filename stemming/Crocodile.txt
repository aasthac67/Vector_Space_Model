crocodil subfamili crocodylina or true crocodil are larg semiaquat reptil that live throughout the tropic in africa asia the america and australia crocodylina all of whose member are consid true crocodil is classifi as a biolog subfamili a broader sens of the term crocodil crocodylida that includ tomistoma is not use in thi articl the term crocodil here appli to onli the speci within the

famili gavialida and all other live and fossil crocodylomorpha although they appear similar crocodil allig and the gharial belong to separ biolog famili the gharial with it narrow snout is easier to distinguish while morpholog differ are more difficult to spot in crocodil and allig the most obviou extern differ are visibl in the head with crocodil have narrow and longer head with a more than a snout compar to allig and caiman anoth obviou trait is that the upper and lower jaw of the crocodil are the same width and the teeth in the lower jaw fall along the edg or outsid the upper jaw when the mouth is close therefor all teeth are visibl unlik an allig which possess in the upper jaw small depress into which the lower teeth fit also when the crocodil mouth is close the larg fourth tooth in the lower jaw fit into a constrict in the upper jaw for specimen the protrud tooth is the most reliabl featur to defin the speci famili crocodil have more web on the toe of the hind feet and can better toler saltwat due to special salt gland for filter out salt which are present but in allig anoth trait that separ crocodil from other crocodilian is their much higher level of
