a frog is ani member of a divers and larg carnivor group of tailless amphibian compos the order anura liter without tail in ancient greek the oldest fossil appear in the earli triassic of madagascar but molecular clock date suggest their origin may extend further back to the permian million year ago frog are wide distribut rang from the tropic to subarct region but the greatest concentr of speci divers is in tropic rainforest there are over record speci account for around of extant amphibian speci they are also one of the five most divers vertebr order warti frog speci tend to be call toad but the distinct between frog and toad is inform not from taxonomi or evolutionari histori all toad are frog but not all frog are toadsan adult frog ha a stout bodi protrud eye tongu limb fold underneath and no tail except in tail frog frog have glandular skin with secret rang from distast to toxic their skin vari in colour from dappl brown grey and green to vivid pattern of bright red or yellow and black to show toxic and ward off predat adult frog live in fresh water and on dri land some speci are adapt for live underground or in tree frog typic lay their egg in water the egg hatch into aquat larva call tadpol that have tail and intern gill they have highli special rasp mouth part suitabl for herbivor omnivor or planktivor diet the life cycl is complet when they metamorphos into adult a few speci deposit egg on land or bypass the tadpol stage adult frog gener have a carnivor diet consist of small invertebr but omnivor speci exist and a few feed on plant matter frog skin ha a rich microbiom which is import to their health frog are extrem effici at convert what they eat into bodi mass they are an import food sourc for predat and part of the food web dynam of mani of the world ecosystem the skin is make them suscept to dehydr so they either live in moist place or have special adapt to deal with dri habitat frog produc a wide rang of vocal particularli in their breed season and exhibit mani differ kind of complex behaviour to attract mate to fend off predat and to gener surviv frog are valu as food by human and also have mani cultur role in literatur symbol and religion they are also seen as environment bellweth with declin in frog popul often view as earli warn sign of environment damag frog popul have declin significantli sinc the more than one third of

around the world conserv biologist are work to understand the caus of these problem and to resolv them etymolog and taxonomi the use of the common name frog and toad ha no taxonom justif from a

prefer a wateri habitat wherea the panamanian golden frog atelopu zeteki is in the toad famili bufonida and ha a smooth skin etymolog the origin of the order name anura and it origin spell anour is the ancient greek alpha priv prefix without and oura oura mean anim tail it refer to the tailless charact of these amphibiansth origin of the word frog are uncertain and debat the word is first attest in old english as frogga but the usual old english word for the frog wa frosc with variant such as frox and forsc and it is agre that the word frog is somehow relat to thi old english frosc remain in dialect use in english as frosh and frosk into the nineteenth centuri and is parallel wide in other german languag with exampl in the modern languag includ german frosch iceland froskur and dutch kik vor these word allow us to reconstruct a common german ancestor froskaz the third edit of the oxford english dictionari find that the etymolog of froskaz is uncertain but agre with argument that it

these are less fertil than their parent give rise to a hybrid zone where the hybrid are preval evolut the origin and evolutionari relationship between the three main group of amphibian are hotli debat a molecular phylogeni base on rdna analysi date from suggest that salamand and caecilian are more close relat to each other than they are to frog and the diverg of the three group took place in the paleozo or earli mesozo befor the breakup of the supercontin pangaea and soon after their diverg from the fish thi would help account for the rel scarciti of amphibian fossil from the period befor the group split anoth molecular phylogenet analysi conduct about the same time conclud that lissamphibian first appear about million year ago and that the hypothesi is more credibl than other theori the neobatrachian seem to have origin in the salamand in east asia and the caecilian in tropic pangaea other research while agre with the main thrust of thi studi question the choic of calibr point use to synchronis the data they propos that the date of lissamphibian diversif should be place in the permian rather less than million year ago a date in better agreement with the palaeontolog data a further studi in use both extinct and live taxa sampl for morpholog as well as molecular data came to the conclus that lissamphibia is monophylet and that it should be nest within lepospondyli rather than within temnospondyli the studi postul that lissamphibia origin no earlier than the late carbonifer some to million year ago the split between anura and caudata wa estim as take place million year ago

other small move prey the tongu normal lie coil in the mouth free at the back and attach to the mandibl at the front it can be shot out and retract at great speed some frog have no tongu and just stuff food into their mouth with their hand the eye assist in the swallow of food as they can be retract through hole in the skull and help push food down the throat the food then move through the oesophagu into the stomach where digest enzym are ad and it is churn up it then proce to the small intestin duodenum and ileum where most digest occur pancreat juic from the pancrea and bile produc by

in the former adopt by the major of speci adult frog at certain time of year assembl at a pond lake or stream to breed mani frog return to the bodi of water in which they develop as larva thi often result in annual migrat involv thousand of individu in explos breeder matur adult frog arriv at breed site in respons to certain trigger factor such as rainfal occur in an arid area in these frog mate and spawn take place promptli and the speed of larval growth is rapid in order to make use of the ephemer pool befor they dri upamong prolong breeder male usual arriv at the breed site first and remain there for some time wherea femal tend to arriv later and depart soon after they have spawn thi mean that male outnumb femal at the water edg and defend territori from which they expel other male they advertis their presenc by call often altern their croak with neighbour frog larger stronger male tend to have deeper call and maintain higher qualiti territori femal select their mate at

liquifi to allow free movement of the develop embryo in certain speci such as the northern frog rana aurora and the wood frog rana sylvatica symbiot unicellular green alga are present in the gelatin

their tail are stiffen by a notochord but doe not contain ani boni or cartilagin element except for a few vertebra at the base which form the urostyl dure metamorphosi thi ha been suggest as an adapt to their lifestyl becaus the transform into frog happen veri fast the tail is made of soft tissu onli as bone and cartilag take a much longer time to be broken down and absorb the tail fin and tip is fragil and will easili tear which is seen as an adapt to escap from predat which tri to grasp them by the tailtadpol are typic herbivor feed mostli on alga includ diatom filter from the water through

tadpol that develop leg earli may be eaten by the other so late develop may have better surviv prospectstadpol are highli vulner to be eaten by fish newt predatori dive beetl and bird such as kingfish some tadpol includ those of the cane toad bufo marinu are poison the tadpol stage may be as short as a week in explos breeder or it may last through one or more winter follow by metamorphosi in the spring metamorphosi at the end of the tadpol stage a frog undergo metamorphosi in which it bodi make a sudden transit into the adult form thi metamorphosi typic last onli hour and is initi by product of the hormon thyroxin thi caus differ tissu to develop in differ way the princip chang that take place includ the develop of the lung and the disappear of the gill and gill pouch make the front leg
