bee are fli insect close relat to wasp and ant known for their role in pollin and in the case of the bee speci the western honey bee for produc honey bee are a monophylet lineag within the superfamili apoidea they are present consid a clade call anthophila there are over known speci of bee in seven recogn biolog famili some speci includ honey bee bumblebe and stingless bee live social in coloni while some speci includ mason bee carpent bee leafcutt bee and sweat bee are solitari bee are found on everi contin except for antarctica in everi habitat on the planet that contain flower plant the most common bee in the northern hemispher are the halictida or sweat bee but they are small and often mistaken for wasp or fli bee rang in size from tini stingless bee speci whose worker are less than millimetr in long to megachil pluto the largest speci of leafcutt bee whose femal can attain a length of millimetr in bee feed on nectar and pollen the former primarili as an energi sourc and the latter primarili for protein and other nutrient most pollen is use as food for their larva vertebr predat of bee includ bird such as insect predat includ beewolv and dragonfli bee pollin is import both ecolog and commerci and the declin in wild bee ha increas the valu of pollin by commerci manag hive of honey bee the analysi of wild bee and hoverfli speci across britain from to found the insect have been lost from a quarter of the place they inhabit in beekeep or apicultur ha been practis for millennia sinc at least the time of ancient egypt and ancient greec bee have appear in mytholog and folklor through all phase of art and literatur from ancient time to the present day although primarili focus in the northern hemispher where beekeep is far more common evolut the ancestor of bee were wasp in the famili crabronida which were predat of other insect the switch from insect prey to pollen may have result from the consumpt of prey insect which were flower visitor and were partial cover with pollen when they were fed to the wasp larva thi same evolutionari scenario may have occur within the vespoid wasp where the pollen wasp evolv from predatori ancestor until recent the oldest bee fossil had been found in new jersey amber cretotrigona prisca of cretac age a corbicul bee a bee fossil from the earli cretac mya melittosphex burmensi is consid an extinct lineag of apoidea sister to the modern bee deriv featur of it morpholog apomorphi place it clearli within the bee but it retain two unmodifi ancestr trait plesiomorphi of the leg two spur and a slender hind basitarsu show it transit statu by the eocen mya there wa alreadi consider divers among eusoci bee lineagesth highli eusoci corbicul apida appear roughli mya and the allodapini within the apida around mya the colletida appear as fossil onli from the late oligocen mya to earli miocen the melittida are known from palaeomacropi eocenicu in the earli eocen the megachilida are known from trace fossil characterist leaf cut from the middl eocen the andrenida are known from the boundari around mya of the floriss shale the halictida first appear in the earli eocen with speci found in amber the stenotritida are known from fossil brood cell of pleistocen age coevolut the earliest flower were shallow bloom pollin by insect such as beetl so the syndrom of insect pollin wa well establish befor the first appear of bee the novelti is that bee are special as pollin agent with behavior and physic modif that specif enhanc pollin and are the most effici pollin insect in a process of coevolut flower develop floral reward such as nectar and longer tube and bee develop longer tongu to extract the nectar bee also develop structur known as scopal hair and pollen basket to collect and carri pollen the locat and type differ among and between group of bee most speci have scopal hair on their hind leg or on the undersid of their abdomen some speci in the famili apida have pollen basket on their hind leg while veri few lack these and instead collect pollen in their crop the appear of these structur drove the adapt radiat of the angiosperm and in turn bee themselv bee coevolv not onli with flower but it is believ that some speci coevolv with mite some provid tuft of hair call acarinaria that appear to provid lodg for mite in return it is believ that mite eat fungi that attack pollen so the relationship in thi case may be mutualistc phylogeni extern thi phylogenet tree is base on debev et al which use molecular phylogeni to demonstr that the bee anthophila aros from deep within the crabronida which is therefor paraphylet the placement of the heterogynaida is uncertain the small subfamili mellinina wa not includ in thi analysi intern thi cladogram of the bee famili is base on hedtk et al which place the former famili dasypodaida and meganomiida as subfamili insid the melittida english name where avail are given in parenthes characterist bee differ from close relat group such as wasp by have branch or seta hair comb on the forelimb for clean their antenna small anatom differ in limb structur and the venat of the hind wing and in femal by have the seventh dorsal abdomin plate divid into two have the

attain a length of millimetr in the smallest speci may be dwarf stingless bee in the tribe meliponini whose worker are less than millimetr in in length social haplodiploid breed system accord to inclus fit theori organ can gain fit not just through increas their own reproduct output but also that of close rel in evolutionari term individu should help rel when cost related benefit the requir for eusoci are more easili fulfil by haplodiploid speci such as bee becaus of their unusu related structurein haplodiploid speci femal develop from fertil egg and male from unfertil egg becaus a male is haploid ha onli one copi of each gene hi daughter which are diploid with two copi of each gene share of hi gene and of their mother therefor they share of their gene with each other thi mechan of

far investig so it is like that haplodiploidi contribut to the evolut of eusoci in bee eusoci bee may be solitari or may live in variou type of commun eusoci appear to have origin from at least three independ origin in halictid bee the most advanc of these are speci with eusoci coloni these are characteris by cooper brood care and a divis of labour into reproduct and adult plu overlap gener thi divis of labour creat special group within eusoci societi which are call cast in some speci group of cohabit femal may be sister and if there is a divis of labour within the group they are consid

there is no divis of labor so these nest lack queen and worker bee for these speci solitari bee typic produc neither honey nor beeswax bee collect pollen to feed their young and have the necessari

typic creat a compart a cell with an egg and some provis for the result larva then seal it off a nest may consist of numer cell when the nest is in wood usual the last those closer to the entranc contain egg that will becom male the adult doe not provid care for the brood onc the egg is laid and usual die after make one or more nest the male typic emerg first and are readi for mate when the femal emerg solitari bee are either stingless or veri unlik to sting onli in if ever while solitari femal each make individu nest some speci such as the european mason bee hopliti anthocopoid and the dawson burrow bee amegilla dawsoni are gregari prefer to make nest near other of the same speci and give the appear of be social larg group of solitari bee nest are call aggreg to distinguish them from coloni in some speci multipl femal share a common nest but each make and provis her own cell independ thi type of group is call commun and is not uncommon the primari advantag appear to be that a
