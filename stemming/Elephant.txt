maintain a constant bodi temperatur as well as in commun the leg carri their great weight eleph are scatter throughout africa south asia and southeast asia and are found in differ habitat includ savannah forest desert and marsh they are herbivor and they stay near water when it is access they are consid to be keyston speci due to their impact on their environ other anim tend to keep their distanc from eleph the except is their predat such as lion tiger hyena and wild dog which usual target onli young eleph calv eleph have a societi in which multipl famili group come togeth to socialis femal cow tend to live in famili group which can consist of one femal with her calv or sever relat femal with offspr the group which do not includ bull are led by the usual oldest cow known as the matriarch male bull leav their famili group when they reach puberti and may live alon or with other male adult bull mostli interact with famili group when look for a mate they enter a state of increas testosteron and aggress known as musth which help them gain domin over other male as well as reproduct success calv are the centr of attent in their famili group and reli on their mother for as long as three year eleph can live up to year in the wild they commun by touch sight smell and sound eleph use infrasound and seismic commun over long distanc eleph intellig ha been compar with that of primat and cetacean they appear to have as well as appear to show empathi for die and dead famili member african eleph are list as vulner and asian eleph as endang by the intern union for conserv of natur iucn one of the biggest threat to eleph popul is the ivori trade as the anim are poach for their ivori tusk other threat to wild eleph includ habitat destruct and conflict with local peopl eleph are use as work anim in asia in the past they were use in war today they are often controversi put on display in zoo or exploit for entertain in circus eleph are highli recognis and have been featur in art folklor religion literatur and popular cultur etymolog the word eleph is base on the latin elepha genit elephanti eleph which is the latinis form of the greek elepha elepha genit elephanto elephanto probabl from a languag like phoenician it is attest in mycenaean greek as genit in linear b syllab script as in mycenaean greek homer use the greek word to mean ivori but after the time of herodotu it also refer to the anim the word eleph appear in middl english as olyfaunt and wa borrow from old french oliph centuri taxonomi and phylogeni eleph belong to the famili elephantida the sole

with it lip floppi trunk syndrom is a condit of trunk paralysi in african bush eleph caus by the degrad of the peripher nerv and muscl begin at the tip teeth eleph usual have teeth the incisor known as the tusk decidu premolar and molar unlik most mammal which grow babi teeth and then replac them with a singl perman set of adult teeth eleph are polyphyodont that have cycl of tooth rotat throughout their live the chew teeth are replac six time in a typic eleph lifetim teeth are not replac by new one emerg from the jaw vertic as in most mammal instead new teeth grow in at the back of the mouth and move forward to push out the old one the first chew tooth on each side of the jaw fall out when the eleph is two to three year old the second set of chew teeth fall out at four to six year old the third set fall out at year of age and set four last until year of age the fifth set of teeth fall out at the earli the sixth and usual final set must last the eleph the rest of it life eleph teeth have dental ridg which are thicker and more in african eleph tusk the tusk of an eleph are modifi second incisor in the upper jaw they replac decidu milk teeth at month of age and grow continu at about cm in a year a newli develop tusk ha a smooth enamel cap that eventu wear off the dentin is known as ivori and it consist of crisscross line pattern known as engin turn which creat

an eleph skin is gener veri tough at cm in thick on the back and part of the head the skin around the mouth anu and insid of the ear is consider thinner eleph typic have grey skin but african eleph look brown or reddish after wallow in colour mud asian eleph have some patch of depigment particularli on the forehead and ear and the area around them calv have brownish or reddish hair especi on the head and back as eleph matur their hair darken and becom sparser but dens concentr of hair and bristl remain on the end of the tail as well as the chin genit and the area around the eye and ear open normal the skin of an asian eleph is cover with more hair than it african counterpartan eleph use mud as a sunscreen protect it skin from ultraviolet light although tough an eleph skin is veri sensit without regular mud bath to protect it from burn insect bite and moistur loss an eleph skin suffer seriou damag after bath the eleph will usual use it trunk to blow dust onto it bodi and thi dri into

cancel bone in place of medullari caviti thi strengthen the bone while still allow haematopoiesi both the front and hind limb can support an eleph weight although is born by the front sinc the limb bone are place on top of each other and under the bodi an eleph can stand still for long period of time without use much energi eleph are incap of rotat their front leg as the ulna and radiu are fix in pronat the palm of the manu face backward the pronat quadratu and the pronat tere are either reduc or absent the circular feet of an eleph have soft tissu or cushion pad beneath the manu or pe which distribut the weight of the anim they appear to have a sesamoid an extra toe similar in placement to a giant panda extra thumb that also help in weight distribut as mani as five toenail can be found on both the front and hind feeteleph can move both forward and backward but can not trot jump or gallop they use onli two gait when move on land the walk and a faster gait similar to run in walk the leg act as pendulum with the hip and shoulder rise and fall while the foot is plant on the ground with no aerial phase the fast gait doe not meet all the criteria of run although the eleph use it leg much like other run anim with the hip and shoulder fall and then rise while the feet are on the ground eleph appear to with their front leg but with their hind leg and can reach a top speed of mph at thi speed most other quadrup are well into a gallop even account for leg length kinet could explain the differ between the motion of eleph and other anim dure locomot the cushion pad expand and contract and reduc both the pain and nois that would come from a veri heavi anim move eleph are capabl swimmer they have been record swim for up to six hour without touch the bottom and have travel as
