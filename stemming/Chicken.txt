by look at the comb or eventu from the develop of spur on the male leg in a few breed and in certain hybrid the male and femal chick may be differenti by colour adult chicken have a fleshi crest on

hen will stop lay and instead will focu on the incub of the egg a full clutch is usual about egg she will sit or set on the nest protest or peck in defens if disturb or remov and she will rare leav
