the wildebeest plural wildebeest or wildebeest also call the gnu new or noo is an antelop in the genu connochaet it belong to the famili bovida which includ antelop cattl goat sheep and other horn ungul connochaet includ two speci both nativ to africa the black wildebeest or gnu c gnou and the blue wildebeest or brindl gnu c taurinu fossil record suggest these two speci diverg about one million year ago result in a northern and a southern speci the blue wildebeest remain in it origin rang and chang veri littl from the ancestr speci while the black wildebeest chang more as adapt to it open grassland habitat in the south the most obviou way of tell the two speci apart are the differ in their colour and in the way their horn are orientedin east africa the blue wildebeest is the most abund speci some popul perform an annual migrat to new graze ground but the black wildebeest is mere nomad breed in both take place over a short period of time at the end of the raini season and the calv are soon activ and are abl to move with the herd a fact necessari for their surviv nevertheless some fall prey to larg carnivor especi the spot hyena wildebeest often graze in mix herd with zebra which give heighten awar of potenti predat they are also alert to the warn signal emit by other anim such as baboon wildebeest are a tourist attract but compet with domest livestock for pastur and are sometim blame by farmer for transfer diseas and parasit to their cattl some illeg hunt goe on but the popul trend is fairli stabl and some popul are in nation park or on privat land the intern union for conserv of natur list both as speci etymolog wildebeest is dutch for wild beast or wild cattl in afrikaan bee cattl while connochaet deriv from the greek word konno konno beard and khait khait flow hair mane some sourc claim the name gnu origin from the khoikhoi name for these anim other contend the name and it pronunci in english go back to the word nu use for the black wildebeest by the san peopl classif taxonomi and evolut the wildebeest genu connochaet is place under the famili bovida and subfamili alcelaphina where it closest rel are the hartebeest alcelaphu spp the hirola beatragu hunteri and speci in the genu damaliscu such as the topi the tsesseb the blesbok and the bontebok the name connochaet wa given by german zoologist hinrich lichtenstein in settler first discov wildebeest in about on their way to the interior of south africa due to their resembl to wild cattl these peopl call them wild ox or wildebeest the blue wildebeest wa first known to western in the northern part of south africa a centuri later in the the earli centuri one speci of the wildebeest c albojubatu wa identifi in eastern africa in two separ race of the wildebeest were introduc name gorgon a albojubatu athi wildebeest and g a mearnsi loita wildebeest howev in the two were onc again merg into a singl race connochaet taurinu albojubatu in the centuri two separ form were recognis gorgon taurinu hecki and g t albojubatu final two distinct type of wildebeest the blue and black wildebeest were identifi the blue wildebeest wa at first place under a separ genu gorgon while the black wildebeest belong to the genu connochaet today they are unit in the singl genu connochaet with the black wildebeest be name c gnou and the blue wildebeest c taurinu accord to a mitochondri dna analysi the black wildebeest are estim to have diverg from the main lineag dure the middl pleistocen and becam a distinct speci around a million year ago a diverg rate around ha been calcul the split doe not seem to have been driven by competit for resourc but instead becaus each speci adopt a differ ecolog nich and occupi a differ trophic levelblu wildebeest fossil date back some million year ago are common and widespread they have been found in the cave at the cradl of humankind north of johannesburg elsewher in south africa they are plenti at such site as elandsfontein cornelia and florisbad the earliest fossil of the black wildebeest were found in sedimentari rock in cornelia in the orang free state and date back about year today five subspeci of the blue wildebeest are recognis while the black wildebeest ha no name subspeci genet and hybrid the diploid number of chromosom in the wildebeest is chromosom were studi in a male and a femal wildebeest in the femal all except a pair of veri larg submetacentr chromosom were found to be acrocentr metaphas were studi in the male chromosom and veri larg submetacentr chromosom were found there as well similar to those in the femal both in size and morpholog other chromosom were acrocentr the x chromosom is a larg acrocentr and the y chromosom a minut oneth two speci of the wildebeest are known to hybridis male black wildebeest have been report to mate with femal blue wildebeest and vice versa the differ in social behaviour and habitat have histor prevent interspecif hybridis between the speci but hybridis may occur when they are both confin within the same area the result offspr are usual fertil a studi of these hybrid anim at spioenkop dam natur reserv in south africa reveal that mani had disadvantag abnorm relat to their

hindquart they have broad muzzl roman nose and shaggi mane and tail the most strike morpholog differ between the black and blue wildebeest are the orient and curvatur of their horn and the colour of their coat the blue wildebeest is the bigger of the two speci in male blue wildebeest stand cm tall at the shoulder and weigh around kg while the black wildebeest stand to cm tall and weigh about kg in femal blue wildebeest have a shoulder height of cm and weigh kg while black wildebeest femal stand cm at the shoulder and weigh kg the horn of blue wildebeest protrud to the side then curv downward befor curv up back toward the skull while the horn of the black wildebeest curv forward then downward befor curv upward at the tip blue wildebeest tend to be a dark grey colour with stripe but may have a bluish sheen the black wildebeest ha hair with a mane that rang in colour from cream to black and a tail the blue wildebeest live in a wide varieti of habitat includ woodland and grassland while the black wildebeest tend to resid exclus in open grassland area in some area the blue wildebeest migrat over long distanc in the winter wherea the black wildebeest doe not the milk of the femal black wildebeest contain a higher protein lower fat and lower lactos content than the milk of the blue wildebeest wildebeest can live more than year though their averag lifespan is around year distribut and habitat wildebeest inhabit the plain and open woodland of part of africa south of the sahara the black wildebeest is nativ to the southernmost part of the contin it histor rang includ

reason for the declin is thought to be the increas competit between cattl and wildebeest for a diminish area of graze land as a result of chang in agricultur practic and possibl fluctuat in
