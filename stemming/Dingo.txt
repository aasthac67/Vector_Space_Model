the dingo cani familiari cani familiari dingo or cani lupu dingo is a dog found in australia it taxonom classif is debat it is a canin that possess a lean hardi bodi adapt for speed agil and stamina the dingo three main coat colour are light ginger or tan black and tan or creami white the skull is and appear larg in proport to the bodyth earliest known dingo fossil found in western australia date to year ago which led to the presumpt that dingo came to australia with seafar prior to that time possibl from sulawesi in indonesia dingo morpholog ha not chang over the past year thi suggest that no artifici select ha been appli over thi periodth dingo is close relat to the new guinea sing dog their lineag split earli from the lineag that led to today domest dog and can be trace back through the malay archipelago to asia a recent genet studi show that the lineag of those dingo found today in the northwestern part of the australian contin split from the lineag of the new guinea sing dog and southeastern dingo bc follow by a split between the new guinea sing dog lineag from the southeastern dingo lineag bc the studi propos that two dingo migrat occur when sea level were lower and

canid specialist group consid the new guinea sing dog and the dingo to be feral dog cani familiari and therefor should not be assess for the iucn red list domest statu the dingo is regard as a feral dog becaus it descend from domest ancestor the dingo relationship with indigen australian is one of commens in which two organ live in close associ but do not depend on each other for surviv they both hunt and sleep togeth the dingo is therefor comfort enough around human to associ with them but is still capabl of live independ ani unown dog can be socialis to becom an own dog as some dingo do when they join human famili although the dingo exist in the wild it associ with human but ha not been select bred similarli to other domest anim therefor it statu as a domest anim is not clear whether the dingo wa a wild or domest speci wa not clarifi from meyer origin descript which translat from the german languag ambigu read it is not known if it is the onli dog speci in new south wale and if it can

when dingo first arriv they would have been taken up by indigen australian who then provid a network for their swift transfer around the contin base on the record distribut time for dog across

ybp by the inund of the sahul shelf fossil remain in australia date to around ybp and no dingo remain have been uncov in tasmania so the dingo is estim to have arriv in australia at a time between and ybp to reach australia through the malay archipelago even at the lowest sea level of the last glacial maximum a journey of at least km over open sea between ancient sunda and sahul wa necessari so they must have accompani human on boatsbas on a comparison with these earli fossil dingo morpholog ha not chang over thousand of year thi suggest that no artifici select ha been appli over thi period and that the dingo repres an earli form of dog they have live bred and undergon natur select in the wild isol from other canin until the arriv of european settler result in a uniqu canid phylogeni whole genom sequenc indic that dog are a genet diverg subspeci of the grey wolf the dog is not a descend of the extant grey wolf but these are sister taxa which share a common ancestor from a ghost popul of wolv that disappear at the end of the late pleistocen the dog and the dingo are not separ speci the dingo and the basenji are basal member of the domest dog clade the term basal taxon refer to a lineag that diverg earli in the histori of the group and lie on a branch that origin near the common ancestor of the group mitochondri genom sequenc indic that the dingo fall within the domest dog clade and that the new guinea sing dog is genet closer to those dingo that live in southeastern australia than to those that live in the northwest the dingo and new guinea sing dog lineag can be

is bitten on the neck or back by dingo run besid it in one area of central australia dingo hunt kangaroo by chase them into a wire fenc where they becom temporarili immobilis the largest male red kangaroo tend to ignor dingo even when the dingo are hunt the younger male and femal a larg eastern grey kangaroo success fought off an attack by a singl dingo that last over an hour wallabi are hunt in a similar manner to kangaroo the differ be that a singl dingo hunt use scent rather than sight and the hunt may last sever hoursdingo pack may attack young cattl and buffalo but never healthi grown

magpi gees for a larg part of their diet and a lone dingo sometim distract these while a sea eagl make a kill that is too heavi for it to carri off with the dingo then drive the sea eagl away they also scaveng on prey drop from the nest platform of sea eagl lone dingo may hunt small rodent and grasshopp in grass by use their sens of smell and hear then pounc on them with their forepaw competitor dingo and their hybrid with the nativ quoll they also in the same territori as the introduc european red fox and feral cat but littl is known about the relationship between these three dingo and their hybrid can drive off fox from sourc of water and occasion eat feral cat dingo can be kill by buffalo and cattl gore and kick them from snake bite and predat on their pup by eagl commun like all domest dog dingo tend toward phonet commun howev in contrast to domest dog dingo howl and whimper more and bark less eight sound class with sound type have been identifi bark compar to most domest dog the bark of a dingo is short and monosyllab and is rare use bark wa observ to make up onli of vocalis dog bark ha alway been distinct from wolf bark australian dingo bark mainli in swoosh

zoologist alfr brehm report a dingo that learn the more typic form of bark and how to use it while it brother did not whether dingo bark or less frequent in gener is not certain howl dingo have three basic form of howl moan and snuff with at least variat usual three kind of howl are distinguish long and persist rise and eb and short and abrupt observ have shown that each kind of howl ha sever

observ less frequent in dingo than among grey wolv it may happen that one dog will begin to howl and sever or all other dog will howl back and bark from time to time in the wilder dingo howl over long distanc to attract other member of the pack to find other dog or to keep intrud at bay dingo howl in choru with signific pitch and with increas number of pack member the variabl of pitch also increas therefor dingo are suspect to be abl to measur the size of a pack without visual contact moreov their highli variabl choru howl have been propos to gener a confound effect in the receiv by make pack

activ is around dusk and dawn the period of activ are short often less than hour with short time of rest dingo have two kind of movement a search movement appar associ with hunt and an exploratori movement probabl for contact and commun with other dog accord to studi in queensland the wild dog dingo hybrid there move freeli at night through urban area and cross street and seem to get along quit well social behaviour the dingo social behaviour is about as flexibl as that of a coyot or grey wolf which is perhap one of the reason the dingo wa origin believ to have descend from the indian wolf while young male are often solitari and nomad in natur breed adult often form a settl pack howev in area of the dingo habitat with a wide space popul breed pair remain togeth apart from other dingo

impact ecolog extinct of thylacin some research propos that the dingo caus the extinct of the thylacin the tasmanian devil and the tasmanian nativ hen from mainland australia becaus of the correl in space and time with the dingo arriv recent studi have question thi propos suggest that climat chang and increas human popul may have been the caus dingo do not seem to have had the same ecolog impact that the red fox had in later time thi might be connect to the dingo way of hunt and the size of their favour prey as well as to the low number of dingo in the time befor european colonisationth assumpt that dingo and thylacin were competitor for the same prey stem from their extern similar the thylacin had a stronger and more effici bite but wa probabl depend on rel small prey while the dingo stronger skull and neck would have allow it to bring down larger prey the dingo wa probabl a superior hunter as it hunt cooper in pack and could better defend resourc while the thylacin wa probabl more solitari also wild dingo popul might have had demograph support from conspecif live with human the extinct of the thylacin on the contin around year ago ha also been link to chang in climat and land use by the aborigin name the dingo as the caus of the extinct is plausibl but signific morpholog differ between the two suggest that the ecolog overlap of both speci might be exagger the dingo ha the dentit of a generalist while the thylacin had the dentit of a specialist carnivor without ani sign of consumpt of carrion or bone thi theori doe not explain how the tasmanian devil and the dingo coexist on the same contin until about year ago when the dingo supposedli caus the tasmanian devil demis the group dynam of dingo should have success kept devil away from carrion and sinc dingo are abl to break bone littl would have been left for the devil to scaveng addit devil are success hunter of to prey so overlap of the speci should have occur in thi area too furthermor the argument that the dingo caus the extinct of the thylacin the devil and the hen are in direct conflict with each other if the dingo were realli so similar to the thylacin and the tasmanian devil in it ecolog role and suppress both then coexist with both for such an extend time is strang although thi is a possibl result of the dingo introduct critic regard the evid for thi as insubstantialin a genet

they deserv sinc the behaviour depend on how the dingo wa rais sinc earli puppyhood he believ that these dog could becom veri decent petsth ownership of dingo as pet and their breed is wide criticis the main critic is that the activ and the result consequ of the dingo conserv group dingo farm and legisl for legal ownership of dingo for peopl in public is seen to be an addit threat to the surviv of the pure dingo thi fear exist becaus the major of these breed activ effect expedit the interbreed of dingo and other domest dog when the identif of a pure dingo is not absolut correct respect when hybrid are sold as pure dingoessupport of breed programm are onli mildli optimist about a success outcom success in the form of a popul viabl for futur can not be easili accomplish accord to david jenkin the breed and reintroduct of pure dingo is no easi option and at the time there were no studi that serious dealt with thi topic especi in area where dingo popul are alreadi presentan addit threat is that breeder may unconsci select tamer dingo by breed individu who are easier to manag therefor it may happen that over the year the tame popul may becom less suitabl for live in the wild than their ancestor in addit a loss of genet divers thu result in a higher suscept to diseas might occur due to a small found popul and neg chang could occur simpli becaus the dog were furthermor some featur that are necessari for surviv in the wild such as hunt techniqu might fade under the condit of domest becaus they are no longer need pet dingo are like to escap interact with other anim the dingo is regard as part of the nativ australian fauna by mani environmentalist and biologist as these dog exist on the contin befor the arriv of the european and a mutual adapt of the dingo and their surround ecosystem had occur much of the present place of wild dog in the australian ecosystem especi in the urban area remain unknown although the ecolog role of dingo in northern and central australia is well understood the same doe not appli to the role of wild dog in the east of the contin in contrast to some claim dingo are assum to have a posit impact on biodivers in area where feral fox are presentdingo are regard as apex predat and possibl perform an ecolog key function like with increas evid from scientif research they control the divers of the ecosystem by limit the number of prey and keep the competit in check wild dog hunt feral livestock such as goat and pig as well as nativ prey and introduc anim the low number of feral goat in northern australia is possibl caus by the presenc of the dingo but whether they control the goat number or not is still disput studi from in the northern wet forest of australia found the dingo there did not reduc the number of feral pig but their predat onli affect the pig popul togeth with the presenc of water buffalo which hinder the pig access to food observ concern the mutual impact of dingo and red fox and cat popul suggest dingo limit the access of fox and cat to certain resourc as a result a disappear of the dingo may caus an increas of red fox and feral cat number and therefor a higher pressur on nativ anim these studi found the presenc of dingo is one of the factor that keep fox number in an area low and therefor reduc pressur on nativ anim which then do not disappear from the area the countrywid number of red fox are especi high where dingo number are low but other factor might respons for thi depend on the area evid wa found for a competit between wild dog and red fox in the blue mountain of new south wale sinc mani overlap occur in the spectrum of prefer prey but onli evid for local competit not on a grand scale wa foundalso dingo can live with red fox and feral cat without reduc their number in area with suffici food resourc for exampl high rabbit number and hide place nearli noth is known about the relationship of wild dog and feral cat except both mostli live in the same area although wild dog also eat cat whether thi affect the cat popul is not knownaddit the disappear of dingo might increas the preval of kangaroo rabbit and australian brushturkey number in the area outsid the dingo fenc the number of dingo and emu is lower than in the area insid howev the number chang depend on the habitat sinc the environ is the same on both side of the fenc the dingo wa assum to be a strong factor for the regul of these speci therefor some peopl demand that dingo number should be allow to increas or dingo should be reintroduc in area with low dingo popul to lower the pressur on endang popul of nativ speci and to reintroduc them in certain area in addit the presenc of the australian brushturkey in queensland increas significantli after dingo bait wa conduct cultur cultur opinion about the dingo are often base on it perceiv cun and the idea that it is an intermedi between civilis and wildnesssom of the earli european settler look on dingo as domest dog while other thought they were more like wolv over the year dingo began to attack sheep and their relationship to the european chang veri quickli they were regard as deviou and cowardli sinc they did not fight brave in the eye of the european and vanish into the bush addit they were seen as promiscu or as devil with a venom bite or saliva so they could be kill unreservedli over the year dingo trapper gain some prestig for their work especi when they manag to kill dingo dingo were associ with thiev vagabond bushrang and parliamentari oppon from the politician began call their oppon dingo mean they were cowardli and treacher and it ha becom a popular form of attack sinc then today the word dingo still stand for coward and cheat with verb and adject form use as wellth imag of the dingo ha rang among some group from the instruct to the demonicceremoni like a keen at the cape york peninsula in the form of howl and dreamtim stori are connect to the dingo which were pass down through the gener the dingo play a promin role in the dreamtim stori of indigen australian but it is rare depict in their cave paint when compar with the extinct thylacin one of the tribal elder of the peopl of the yarralin northern territori region tell that the dreamtim dingo is the ancestor of both dingo and human the dingo are what we would be if we were not what we are similar to how european acquir dingo the aborigin peopl of australia acquir dog from the immigr veri quickli thi process wa so fast that franci barralli surveyor on earli expedit around the coloni at port jackson discov in that five dog of european origin were there befor him one theori hold that other domest dog adopt the role of the pure dingo introduc anim such as the water buffalo and the domest cat have been adopt into the indigen aborigin cultur in the form of ritual tradit paint and dreamtim storiesmost of the publish myth origin from the western desert and show a remark complex in some stori dingo are the central charact while in other they are onli minor one one time an ancestor from the dreamtim creat human and dingo or gave them their current shape stori mention creation social accept behaviour and explan whi some thing are the way they are myth exist about shapeshift human to dingo or vice versa and the creation of certain landscap or element of those landscap like waterhol or mountain econom livestock farm commenc expand across australia from the earli which led to conflict between the dingo and grazier sheep and to a lesser extent cattl are an easi target for dingo the pastoralist and the govern bodi that support thi industri have shot trap and poison dingo or destroy dingo pup in their den after two centuri of persecut the dingo or hybrid can still be found across most of the continentresearch on the real extent of the damag and the reason for thi problem onli start recent livestock can die from mani caus and when the carcass is found determin with certainti the caus of death is often difficult sinc the outcom of an attack on livestock depend to a high degre on the behaviour and experi of the predat and the prey onli direct observ is certain to determin whether an attack wa by dingo or other domest dog even the exist of remnant of the prey in the scat of wild dog doe not prove they are pest sinc wild dog also eat carrion the cattl industri can toler low to moder and sometim high grade of wild dog therefor dingo are not so easili regard as pest in these area in the case of sheep and goat a attitud is common the biggest threat are dog that live insid or near the paddock area the extent of sheep loss is hard to determin due to the wide pastur land in some part of australia in cattl loss in the northern territori rangeland graze area were estim to be up to therefor factor such as avail of nativ prey as well as the defend behaviour and health of the cattl play an import role in the number of loss a studi in central australia in confirm that dingo onli have a low impact on cattl number when a suffici suppli of other prey such as kangaroo and rabbit is avail in some part of australia the loss of calv is assum to be minimis if horn cattl are use instead of poll the precis econom impact is not known in thi case and the rescu of some calv is unlik to compens for the necessari cost of control measur calv usual suffer less lethal wound than sheep due to their size and the protect by the adult cattl so have a higher chanc of surviv an attack as a result the evid of a dog attack may onli be discov after the cattl have been herd back into the enclosur and sign such as bitten ear tail and other wound are discov the opinion of cattl owner regard dingo are more variabl than those of sheep owner some cattl owner believ that the weaken mother lose her calf is better in time of drought so that she doe not have to care for her calf too therefor these owner are more hesit to kill dingo the cattl industri may benefit from the predat of dingo on rabbit kangaroo and rat furthermor the mortal rate of calv ha mani possibl caus and discrimin between them is difficult the onli reliabl method to document the damag would be to document all pregnant cow then observ their develop and those of their calv the loss of calv in observ area where dingo were control wa higher than in other area loss of livestock is therefor not necessarili caus by the occurr of dingo and is independ from wild dog one research ha state that for cattl station where dingo were control kangaroo were abund and thi affect the avail of grassdomest dog are the onli terrestri predat in australia that are big enough to kill fulli grown sheep and onli a few sheep manag to recov from the sever injuri in the case of lamb death can have mani caus apart from attack by predat which are blame for the death becaus they eat from the carcass although attack by red fox are possibl such attack are more rare than previous thought the fact that the sheep and goat industri is much more suscept to damag caus by wild dog than the cattl industri is mostli due to two factor the flight behaviour of the sheep and their tendenc to flock togeth in the face of danger and the hunt method of wild dog along with their effici way of handl goat and sheep therefor the damag to the livestock industri doe not correl to the number of wild dog in an area except that no damag occur where no wild dog occur accord to a report from the govern of queensland wild dog cost the state about million annual due to livestock loss the spread of diseas and control measur loss for the livestock industri alon were estim to be as high as million in barcaldin queensland up to of all sheep are kill by dingo annual a situat which ha been describ as an epidem accord to a survey among cattl owner in perform by the park and wildlif servic owner estim their annual loss due to wild dog depend on the district to be from to in a studi in northern south australia indic that loss averag with no signific reduct due to dingo bait the calf loss did not correl with increas dingo activ and the cattl diseas pestiviru and leptospirosi were a major caus dingo then scaveng on the carcass there wa also evid of dingo predat on calvesamong the indigen australian dingo were also use as hunt aid live hot water bottl and camp dog their scalp were use as a kind of currenc their teeth were tradit use for decor purpos and their

inform concern cultur import to indigen peopl and the import of dingo and the impact of control measur on other speci is also lack in some area histor the attitud and need of indigen peopl were not
