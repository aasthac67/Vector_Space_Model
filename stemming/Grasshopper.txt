grasshopp are a group of insect belong to the subord caelifera they are among what is probabl the most ancient live group of chew herbivor insect date back to the earli triassic around million year ago grasshopp are typic insect with power hind leg which allow them to escap from threat by leap vigor as hemimetabol insect they do not undergo complet metamorphosi they hatch from an egg into a nymph or hopper which undergo five moult becom more similar to the adult insect at each development stage at high popul densiti and under certain environment condit some grasshopp speci can chang color and behavior and form swarm under these circumst they are known as locust grasshopp are with a few speci at time becom seriou pest of cereal veget and pastur especi when they swarm in their million as locust and destroy crop over wide area they protect themselv from predat by camouflag when detect mani speci attempt to startl the predat with a while jump and if adult launch themselv into the air usual fli for onli a short distanc other speci such as the rainbow grasshopp have warn color which deter predat grasshopp are affect by parasit and variou diseas and mani predatori creatur feed on both nymph and adult the egg are subject to attack by parasitoid and predat grasshopp have had a long relationship with human swarm of locust can have devast effect and caus famin and even in smaller number the insect can be seriou pest they are use as food in countri such as mexico and indonesia they featur in art symbol and literatur the studi of grasshopp speci is call acridolog phylogeni grasshopp belong to the subord caelifera although grasshopp is sometim use as a common name for the subord in gener some sourc restrict it to the more advanc group they may be place in the infraord acrididea and have been as grasshopp in older text to distinguish them from the term grasshopp now or katydid with their much longer antenna the phylogeni of the caelifera base on mitochondri ribosom rna of taxa in six out of seven superfamili is shown as a cladogram the ensifera cricket etc caelifera and all the superfamili of grasshopp except pamphagoidea appear to be monophylet in evolutionari term the split between the caelifera and the ensifera is no more recent than the boundari the earliest insect that are certainli caeliferan are in the extinct famili locustopseida and locustavida from the earli triassic roughli million year ago the group diversifi dure the triassic and have remain import from that time to now the first modern famili such as the eumastacida tetrigida and tridactylida appear in the cretac though some insect that might belong to the last two of these group are found in the earli jurass morpholog classif is difficult becaus mani taxa have converg toward a common habitat type recent taxonomist have concentr on the intern genitalia especi those of the male thi inform is not avail from fossil specimen and the palaentolog taxonomi is found princip on the venat of the hindwingsth caelifera includ some valid genera and about known speci mani undescrib speci probabl exist especi in tropic wet forest the caelifera have a predominantli tropic distribut with fewer speci known from temper zone but most of the superfamili have repres worldwid they are almost exclus herbivor and are probabl the oldest live group of chew herbivor insectsth most divers superfamili is the acridoidea with around speci the two main famili in thi are the acridida grasshopp and locust with a worldwid distribut and the romaleida lubber grasshopp found chiefli in the new world the ommexechida and tristirida are south american and the lentulida lithidiida and pamphagida are mainli african the pauliniid are nocturn and can swim or skate on water and the lentulid are wingless pneumorida are nativ to africa particularli southern africa and are distinguish by the inflat abdomen of the male characterist grasshopp have the typic insect bodi plan of head thorax and abdomen the head is held vertic at an angl to the bodi with the mouth at the bottom the head bear a larg pair of compound eye which give vision three simpl eye which can detect light and dark and a pair of antenna that are sensit to touch and smell the mouthpart are modifi for chew and there are two sensori palp in front of the jawsth thorax and abdomen are segment and have a rigid cuticl made up of overlap plate compos of chitin the three fuse thorac segment bear three pair of leg and two pair of wing the forew known as tegmina are narrow and leatheri while the hindw are larg and membran the vein provid strength the leg are termin by claw for grip the hind leg is particularli power the femur is robust and ha sever ridg where differ surfac join and the inner ridg bear stridulatori peg in some speci the posterior edg of the tibia bear a doubl row of spine and there are a pair of articul spur near it lower end the interior of the thorax hous the muscl that control the wing and leg the abdomen ha eleven segment the first of which is fuse to the thorax and contain the tympan organ and hear system segment two to eight are and join by flexibl membran segment nine to eleven are reduc in size segment nine bear a pair of cerci and segment ten and eleven hous the reproduct organ femal grasshopp are normal larger than male with short ovipositor the name of the subord caelifera come from the latin and mean refer to the shape of the ovipositorthos speci that make easili heard nois usual do so by rub a row of peg on the hind leg against the edg of the forew stridul these sound are produc mainli by male to attract femal though in some speci the femal also stridulategrasshopp may be confus with cricket but they differ in mani aspect these includ the number of segment in their antenna and the structur of the ovipositor as well as the locat of the tympan organ and the method by which sound is produc ensiferan have antenna that can be much longer than the bodi and have at least segment while caeliferan have fewer segment in their shorter stouter antenna biolog diet and digest most grasshopp are polyphag eat veget from multipl plant sourc but some are omnivor and also eat anim tissu and anim faec in gener their prefer is for grass includ mani cereal grown as crop the digest system is typic of insect with malpighian tubul discharg into the midgut carbohydr are digest mainli in the crop while protein are digest in the ceca of the midgut saliva is abund but larg free of enzym help to move food and malpighian secret along the gut some grasshopp possess cellulas which by soften plant cell wall make plant cell content access to other digest enzym sensori organ grasshopp have a typic insect nervou system and have an extens set of extern sens organ on the side of the head are a pair of larg compound eye which give a broad field of vision and can detect movement shape colour and distanc there are also three simpl eye ocelli on the forehead which can detect light intens a pair of antenna contain olfactori smell and touch receptor and mouthpart contain gustatori tast receptor at the front end of the abdomen there is a pair of tympan organ for sound recept there are numer fine hair seta cover the whole bodi that act as mechanoreceptor touch and wind sensor and these are most dens on the antenna the palp part of the mouth and on the cerci at the tip of the abdomen there are special receptor campaniform sensilla embed in the cuticl of the leg that sens pressur and cuticl distort there are intern chordoton sens organ special to detect posit and movement about the joint of the exoskeleton the receptor convey inform to the central nervou system through sensori neuron and most of these have their cell bodi locat in the peripheri near the receptor site itself circul and respir like other insect grasshopp have an open circulatori system and their bodi caviti are fill with haemolymph a structur in the upper part of the abdomen pump the fluid to the head from where it percol past the tissu and organ on it way back to the abdomen thi system circul nutrient throughout the bodi and carri metabol wast to be excret into the gut other function of the haemolymph includ wound heal heat transfer and the provis of hydrostat pressur but the circulatori system is not involv in gaseou exchang respir is perform use trachea tube which open at the surfac of the thorax and abdomen through pair of valv spiracl larger insect may need to activ ventil their bodi by open some spiracl while other remain close use abdomin muscl to expand and contract the bodi and pump air through the system jump a larg grasshopp such as a locust can jump about a metr twenti bodi length without use it wing the acceler peak at about g grasshopp jump by extend their larg back leg and push against the substrat the ground a twig a blade of grass or whatev els they are stand on the reaction forc propel them into the air they jump for sever reason to escap from a predat to launch themselv into flight or simpli to move from place to place for the escap jump in particular there is strong select pressur to maxim veloc sinc thi determin the rang thi mean that the leg must thrust against the ground with both high forc and a high veloc of movement a fundament properti of muscl is that it can not contract with high forc and high veloc at the same time grasshopp overcom thi by use a catapult mechan to amplifi the mechan power produc by their musclesth jump is a process first the grasshopp fulli flex the lower part of the leg tibia against the upper part femur by activ the flexor tibia muscl the back leg of the grasshopp in the top photograph are in thi preparatori posit second there is a period of in which forc build up in the larg pennat extensor tibia muscl but the tibia is kept flex by the simultan contract of the flexor tibia muscl the extensor muscl is much stronger than the flexor muscl but the latter is aid by specialis in the joint that give it a larg effect mechan advantag over the former when the tibia is fulli flex can last for up to half a second and dure thi period the extensor muscl shorten and store elast strain energi by distort stiff cuticular structur in the leg the extensor muscl contract is quit slow almost isometr which allow it to develop high forc up to n in the desert locust but becaus it is slow onli low power is need the third stage of the jump is the trigger relax of the flexor muscl which releas the tibia from the flex posit the subsequ rapid tibial extens is driven mainli by the relax of the elast structur rather than by further shorten of the extensor muscl in thi way the stiff cuticl act like the elast of a catapult or the bow of a energi is put into the store at low power by slow but strong muscl contract and retriev from the store at high power by rapid relax of the mechan elast structur stridul male grasshopp spend much of the day stridul sing more activ
