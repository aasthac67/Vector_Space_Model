up to m ft environ about speci are saltwat crab brackish water crab freshwat crab terrestri crab or semiterrestri crabsthey are found throughout the world tropic and semitrop region they were previous thought to be a monophylet group but are now believ to repres at least two distinct lineag one in the old world and one in the new world evolut the earliest unambigu crab fossil date from the jurass although carbonifer imocari known onli from it carapac may be a primit crab the radiat of crab in the cretac and afterward may be link either to the of gondwana or to the concurr radiat of boni fish crab main predat sexual dimorph crab often show mark sexual dimorph male often have larger claw a tendenc that is particularli pronounc in the fiddler crab of the genu uca ocypodida in fiddler crab male have one greatli enlarg claw use for commun particularli for attract a mate anoth conspicu differ is the form of the pleon abdomen in most male crab thi is narrow and triangular in form while femal have a broader round abdomen thi is becaus femal crab brood fertilis egg on their pleopod reproduct and lifecycl crab attract a mate through chemic pheromon visual acoust or vibratori mean pheromon are use by most fulli aquat crab while terrestri and semiterrestri crab often use visual signal such as fiddler crab male wave their larg claw to attract femal the vast number of brachyuran crab have intern fertilis and mate for mani aquat speci mate take place just after the femal ha moult and is still soft femal can store the sperm for a long time befor use it to fertilis their egg when fertilis ha taken place the egg are releas onto the femal abdomen below the tail flap secur with a sticki materi in thi locat they are protect dure embryon develop femal carri egg are call berri sinc the egg resembl round berri when develop is complet the femal releas the newli hatch larva into the water where they are part of the plankton the releas is often time with the tide the tini zoea larva can float and take advantag of water current they have a spine which probabl reduc the rate of predat by larger anim the zoea of most speci must find food but some crab provid enough yolk in the egg that the larval stage can continu to live off the yolk each speci ha a particular number of zoeal stage separ by moult befor they chang into a megalopa stage which resembl an adult crab except for have the abdomen tail stick out behind after one more moult the crab is a juvenil live on the bottom rather than float in the water thi last moult from megalopa to juvenil is critic and it must take place in a habitat that is suitabl for the juvenil to survivemost speci of terrestri crab must migrat down to the ocean to releas their larva in some case thi entail veri extens migrat after live for a short time as larva in the ocean the juvenil must do thi migrat in revers in mani tropic area with land crab these migrat often result in consider roadkil of migrat crabsonc crab have becom juvenil they still have to keep moult mani more time to becom adult they are cover with a hard shell which would otherwis prevent growth the moult cycl is coordin by hormon when prepar for moult the old shell is soften and partli erod away while the rudimentari begin of a new shell form under it at the time of moult the crab take in a lot of water to expand and crack open the old shell at a line of weak along the back edg of the carapac the crab must then extract all of itself includ it leg mouthpart eyestalk and even the line of the front and back of the digest tract from the old shell thi is a difficult process that take mani hour and if a crab get stuck it will die after free itself from the old shell now call an exuvia the crab is extrem soft and hide until it new shell ha harden while the new shell is still soft the crab can expand it to make room for futur growth behaviour crab typic walk sideway a behaviour which give us the word crabwis becaus of the articul of the leg which make a sidelong gait more effici howev some crab walk forward or backward includ raninid libinia emarginata and mictyri platychel some crab notabl the portunida and matutida are also capabl of swim the portunida especi so as their last pair of walk leg is flatten into swim paddlescrab are mostli activ anim with complex behaviour pattern they can commun by drum or wave their pincer crab tend to be aggress toward one anoth and male often fight to gain access to femal on rocki seashor where nearli all cave and crevic are occupi crab may also fight over hide hole fiddler crab genu uca dig
