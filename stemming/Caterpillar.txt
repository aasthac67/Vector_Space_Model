caterpillar are the larval stage of member of the order lepidoptera the insect order compris butterfli and moth as with most common name the applic of the word is arbitrari sinc the larva of sawfli are commonli call caterpillar as well both lepidopteran and symphytan larva have eruciform bodi shape caterpillar of most speci are herbivor folivor but not all some about are insectivor even cannibalist some feed on other anim product for exampl cloth moth feed on wool and horn moth feed on the hoov and horn of dead ungul caterpillar are typic voraci feeder and mani of them are among the most seriou of agricultur pest in fact mani moth speci are best known in their caterpillar stage becaus of the damag they caus to fruit and other agricultur produc wherea the moth are obscur and do no direct harm convers variou speci of caterpillar are valu as sourc of silk as human or anim food or for biolog control of pest plant etymolog the origin of the word caterpillar date from the earli centuri they deriv from middl english catirpel catirpel probabl an alter of old north french catepelos cate cat from latin cattu pelos hairi from latin pilosu the inchworm or looper caterpillar from the famili geometrida are so name becaus of the way they move appear to measur the earth the word geometrid mean in greek the primari reason for thi unusu locomot is the elimin of nearli all the proleg except the clasper on the termin segment descript caterpillar have soft bodi that can grow rapidli between moult their size vari between speci and instar moult from as small as mm up to cm some larva of the order hymenoptera ant bee and wasp can appear like the caterpillar of the lepidoptera such larva are mainli seen in the sawfli subord howev while these larva superfici resembl caterpillar they can be distinguish by the presenc of proleg on everi abdomin segment an absenc of crochet or hook on the proleg these are present on lepidopteran caterpillar one pair of promin ocelli on the head capsul and an absenc of the sutur on the front of the headlepidopteran caterpillar can be differenti from sawfli larva by the number of pair of sawfli larva have or more pair while caterpillar have a maximum of pair the number of stemmata simpl eye the sawfli larva have onli two while caterpillar usual have twelv six each side of the head the presenc of crochet on the proleg these are absent in the sawfli sawfli larva have an invari smooth head capsul with no cleavag line while lepidopter caterpillar bear an invert y or v adfront sutur fossil in a geometrid moth caterpillar date back to the eocen epoch approxim million year ago wa found preserv in baltic amber it wa describ under eogeomet vaden previous anoth fossil date back approxim million year wa found in lebanes amber defens mani anim feed on caterpillar as they are rich in protein as a result caterpillar have evolv variou mean of defens caterpillar have evolv defens against physic condit such as cold hot or dri environment condit some arctic speci like gynaephora groenlandica have special bask and aggreg behaviour apart from physiolog adapt to remain in a dormant state appear the appear of a caterpillar can often repel a predat it mark and certain bodi part can make it seem poison or bigger in size and thu threaten or some type of caterpillar are inde poison or distast and their bright color is aposemat other may mimic danger caterpillar or other anim while not be danger themselv mani caterpillar are cryptic color and resembl the plant on which they feed an exampl of caterpillar that use camouflag for defenc is the speci nemoria arizonaria if the caterpillar hatch in the spring and feed on oak catkin they appear green if they hatch in the summer they appear dark color like oak twig the differenti develop is link to the tannin content in the diet caterpillar may even have spine or growth that resembl plant part such as thorn some look like object in the environ such as bird drop some geometrida cover themselv in plant part while bagworm construct and live in a bag cover in sand pebbl or plant materi chemic defens more aggress measur are taken by some caterpillar these measur includ have spini bristl or long fine seta with detach tip that will irrit by lodg in the skin or mucou membran howev some bird such as cuckoo will swallow even the hairiest of caterpillar other caterpillar acquir toxin from their host plant that render them unpalat to most of their predat for instanc ornat moth caterpillar util pyrrolizidin alkaloid that they obtain from their food plant to deter predat the most aggress caterpillar defens are bristl associ with venom gland these bristl are call urtic hair a venom which is among the most potent defens chemic in ani anim is produc by the south american silk moth genu lonomia it venom is an anticoagul power enough to caus a human to hemorrhag to death see lonomiasi thi chemic is be investig for potenti medic applic most urtic hair rang in effect from mild irrit to dermat exampl moth plant contain toxin which protect them from herbivor but some caterpillar have evolv countermeasur which enabl them to eat the leav of such toxic plant in addit to be unaffect by the poison the caterpillar sequest it in their bodi make them highli toxic to predat the chemic are also carri on into the adult stage these toxic speci such as the cinnabar moth tyria jacobaea and monarch danau plexippu caterpillar usual advertis themselv with the danger color of red yellow and black often in bright stripe see aposemat ani predat that attempt to eat a caterpillar with an aggress defens mechan will learn and avoid futur attempt some caterpillar regurgit acid digest juic at attack enemi mani papilionid larva produc bad smell from extrud gland call osmeteria defens behavior mani caterpillar display feed behavior which allow the caterpillar to remain hidden from potenti predat mani feed in protect environ such as enclos insid silk galleri roll leav or by mine between the leaf surfac some caterpillar like earli instar of the tomato hornworm and tobacco hornworm have long organ attach to the end of their bodi the caterpillar wiggl these organ to frighten away fli and predatori wasp some caterpillar can evad predat by use a silk line and drop off from branch when disturb mani speci thrash about violent when disturb to scare away potenti predat one speci amorpha juglandi even make high pitch whistl that can scare away bird social behavior and relationship with other insect some caterpillar obtain protect by associ themselv with ant the lycaenid butterfli are particularli well known for thi they commun with their ant protector by vibrat as well as chemic mean and typic provid food rewardssom caterpillar are gregari larg aggreg are believ to help in reduc the level of parasit and predat cluster amplifi the signal of aposemat color and individu may particip in group regurgit or display pine processionari thaumetopoea pityocampa caterpillar often link into a long train to move through tree and over the ground the head of the lead caterpillar is visibl but the other head can appear hidden forest tent caterpillar cluster dure period of cold weather predat caterpillar suffer predat from mani anim the european pie flycatch is one speci that prey upon caterpillar the flycatch typic find caterpillar among oak foliag paper wasp includ those in the genu polist and polybia catch caterpillar to feed their young and themselv behavior caterpillar have been call eat machin and eat leav voraci most speci shed their skin four or five time as their bodi grow and they eventu enter a pupal stage befor becom adult caterpillar grow veri quickli for instanc a tobacco hornworm will increas it weight in less than twenti day an adapt that enabl them to eat so much is a mechan in a special midgut that quickli transport ion to the lumen midgut caviti to keep the potassium level higher in the midgut caviti than in the hemolymph most caterpillar are sole herbivor mani are restrict to feed on one speci of plant while other are polyphag some includ the cloth moth feed on detritu some are predatori and may prey on other speci of caterpillar eg hawaiian eupithecia other feed on egg of other insect aphid scale insect or ant larva a few are parasit on cicada or leaf hopper epipyropida some hawaiian caterpillar hyposmocoma molluscivora use silk trap to captur snailsmani caterpillar are nocturn for exampl the cutworm of the famili noctuida hide at the base of plant dure the day and onli feed at night other such as gypsi moth lymantria dispar larva chang their activ pattern depend on densiti and larval stage with more diurnal feed in earli instar and high densiti econom effect caterpillar caus much damag mainli by eat leav the propens for damag is enhanc by monocultur farm practic especi where the caterpillar is specif adapt to the host plant under cultiv the cotton bollworm caus enorm loss other speci eat food crop caterpillar have been the target of pest control through the use of pesticid biolog control and agronom practic mani speci have becom resist to pesticid bacteri toxin such as those from bacillu thuringiensi which are evolv to affect the gut of lepidoptera have been use in spray of bacteri spore toxin extract and also by incorpor gene to produc them within the host plant these approach are defeat over time by the evolut of resist mechan in the insectspl evolv mechan of resist to be eaten by caterpillar includ the evolut of chemic toxin and physic barrier such as hair incorpor host plant resist hpr through plant breed is anoth approach use in reduc the impact of caterpillar on crop plantssom caterpillar are use in industri the silk industri is base on the silkworm caterpillar human health caterpillar hair can be a caus of human health problem caterpillar hair sometim have venom in them and speci from approxim famili of moth or butterfli worldwid can inflict seriou human injuri rang from urticari dermat and atop asthma to osteochondr consumpt coagulopathi kidney failur and brain bleed skin rash are the most common but there have been fatal lonomia is a frequent caus of envenom in brazil with case report between and lethal rang up to with death caus most often by intracrani hemorrhagecaterpillar hair ha also been known to caus the sharp barb on the end of caterpillar hair can get lodg in soft tissu and mucou membran such as the eye onc they enter such tissu they can be difficult to extract often exacerb the problem as they migrat across the membranethi becom a particular problem in an indoor set the hair easili enter build through ventil system and accumul in indoor environ becaus of their small size which make it difficult for them to be vent out thi accumul increas the risk of human contact in indoor environmentscaterpillar are a food sourc in some cultur for exampl in south africa mopan worm are eaten by the bushmen and in china silkworm are
